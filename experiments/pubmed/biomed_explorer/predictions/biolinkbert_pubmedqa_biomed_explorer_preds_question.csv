1,2019,19219097,"Background: Cranberries have been used for prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections for decades. The berries contain proanthocyanidins that may reduce the susceptibility to infection by preventing bacteria from attaching to uroepithelial cells. Several clinical trials have been published during recent years. This article reviews documentation of cranberries on clinical effect, adverse events, drug interactions and use during pregnancy and lactation. Material and methods: Clinical effects of cranberries have been assessed based on the Cochrane review from January 2007 and literature on clinical trials retrieved from a systematic search of PubMed and Embase (from 1 January 2007 to 29 October 2008) with the search terms ""cranberry"", ""Vaccinium macrocarpon"", ""Vaccinium oxycoccus"". Results and interpretation: Some evidence exists on cranberries' preventive effect on recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections in women. The evidence is inconclusive for children, men and older people (both men and women). Studies of people with neuropathic bladder are contradictory. Most of the clinical trials published have several flaws and have not used standardised products. More evidence is needed to determine the optimum dosage, method of administration and the minimum length of treatment. Cranberries should not be used during pregnancy and lactation due to lack of safety data. Further, properly designed studies with standardised products and relevant outcomes are needed.",Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,0.6771168112754822
1,2019,28288837,"Purpose: We sought to clarify the association between cranberry intake and the prevention of urinary tract infections. Materials and methods: This systematic review, which complies with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) statement, was done as a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of clinical trials. Results: The findings clearly showed the potential use of cranberries for the clinical condition of urinary tract infection. Cranberry products significantly reduced the incidence of urinary tract infections as indicated by the weighted risk ratio (0.6750, 95% CI 0.5516-0.7965, p 0.0001). The results of subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients at some risk for urinary tract infections were more susceptible to the effects of cranberry ingestion. Conclusions: The results of the current study could be used by physicians to recommend cranberry ingestion to decrease the incidence of urinary tract infections, particularly in individuals with recurrent urinary tract infections. This would also reduce the administration of antibiotics, which could be beneficial since antibiotics can lead to the worldwide emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms.",Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,0.9362148642539978
1,2019,22760907,"Lower urinary tract infections are very common diseases. Recurrent urinary tract infections remain challenging to treat because the main treatment option is long-term antibiotic prophylaxis; however, this poses a risk for the emergence of bacterial resistance.

1,2019,19636526,"Recurrent urinary tract infections are a frequent problem in urological practice. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis can cause resistance of some intestinal bacteria, and after therapy is stopped, infections often resume. In controlled studies, general recommendations for prophylaxis were shown to inhibit reinfection. One of these recommendations is the consumption of cranberries. A review of the literature in PubMed as well as the recently published Cochrane database systematic review confirmed that daily consumption of cranberries prevents recurrent urinary tract infections. In vitro studies have shown that binding of the P fimbriae of Escherichia coli to the uroepithelial tissue can be inhibited in the presence of proanthocyanidins, the active ingredient of cranberries. In clinical studies, the evidence is not so pronounced. Many other bacteria have fimbriae, but only a few subpopulations have P fimbriae. P fimbriae are frequent in E. coli, so this adhesion can be prevented. However, in a subanalysis of randomized and controlled studies, it was shown that women with recurrent urinary tract infections might profit from consuming cranberries.",Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,0.5905249118804932

The purpose of this article is to present a review of research-based information regarding the ability of cranberries to prevent UTIs in adults at risk for UTIs. Current evidence suggests that cranberries decrease bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells and thus decrease the incidence of UTIs without adverse effects in most individuals. Thus clinicians may safely advise patients that cranberries are helpful in preventing UTIs.

1,2019,16329274,"Cranberries are widely used in the treatment and prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and for those at risk of such infections. With the growing resistance to antibiotics, cranberries can be viewed as a useful non-pharmaceutical remedy (Lavender, 2000). The initial studies that looked at the effects of cranberries on urine showed that the excretion of hippuric acid from the berries helped the urine to remain acidic, which could explain why they could be used to treat and prevent infection (Harkin, 2000). Recent studies argue that cranberries prevent Escherichia coli (E. coli) from adhering to uroepithelial cells in the bladder (Howell and Foxman, 2002). Cranberries contain a group of compounds, called proanthocyanidins, which are condensed tannins (Gray, 2002; Lowe and Fagelman, 2001; Kuzminski, 1996).

1,2019,24139545,"Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections, and over 50% of women will have a UTI during their lifetimes. Antibiotics are used for prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs but can lead to emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Therefore, it is reasonable to investigate nutritional strategies for prevention of UTIs. Cranberry juices and supplements have been used for UTI prophylaxis, but with variable efficacy. Because dried cranberries may contain a different spectrum of polyphenolics than juice, consuming berries may or may not be more beneficial than juice in decreasing the incidence of UTIs in susceptible women. The primary objectives of this study were to determine if consumption of sweetened, dried cranberries (SDC) decreases recurrent UTIs and whether this intervention would alter the heterogeneity, virulence factor (VF) profiles, or numbers of intestinal E. coli. Methods: Twenty women with recurrent UTIs were enrolled in the trial and consumed one serving of SDC daily for two weeks. Clinical efficacy was determined by two criteria, a decrease in the six-month UTI rates pre- and post-consumption and increased time until the first UTI since beginning the study. Strain heterogeneity and virulence factor profiles of intestinal E. coli isolated from rectal swabs were determined by DNA fingerprinting and muliplex PCR, respectively. The numbers of intestinal E. coli eluted from rectal swabs pre- and post-consumption were also quantified. Results: Over one-half of the patients did not experience a UTI within six months of SDC consumption, and the mean UTI rate per six months decreased significantly. Kaplan-Meier analysis of infection incidence in women consuming SDC compared to patients in a previous control group showed a significant reduction in time until first UTI within six months. The heterogeneity, VF profiles, and prevalence of intestinal E. coli strains were not significantly different after cranberry consumption. Conclusions: Results of this study indicate a beneficial effect from consuming SDC to reduce the number of UTIs in susceptible women. Because there were no changes in the heterogeneity or VF profiles of E. coli, additional studies are needed to determine the mechanism of action of SDC for reduction of UTIs.",Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,0.7136043310165405

Alternative therapies, despite the term, should not be considered as an alternative to antiepileptic medication; they complement accepted drug treatment. Alternative therapies like yoga, through techniques that relax the body and mind, reduce stress, improve seizure control, and also improve quality of life. Ketogenic diet is a safe and effective treatment for intractable epilepsies; it has been recommended since 1921. The diet induces ketosis, which may control seizures. The most successful treatment of epilepsy is with modern antiepileptic drugs, which can achieve control of seizures in 70-80% cases. Patients opt for alternative therapies because they may be dissatisfied with antiepileptic drugs due to their unpleasant side effects, the long duration of treatment, failure to achieve control of seizures, cultural beliefs and, in the case of women, because they wish to get pregnant Surgical treatment may lead to physical and psychological sequelae and is an option only for a minority of patients.

3,2019,23589718,"The efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) on epilepsy remains to be verified because of previous controversies that might be due to the complexity of the effects induced by different acupoints and stimulation approaches adopted. Therefore, we investigated the effects of EA on epilepsy to determine the specific acupoints and optimal stimulation parameters in this work. Experimental epilepsy was induced by injecting kainic acid to the lateral cerebral ventricle of adult male SD rats. EA with a low-frequency (10 Hz/1 mA) or high-frequency (100 Hz/1 mA) current was applied to the epileptic model for 30 minutes starting at 0.5 hour after the injection. Four pairs of acupoints were tested, that is, Shuigou (DU26) + Dazhui (DU14), Jinsuo (DU8) + Yaoqi (EXB9), Neiguan (PC6) + Quchi (LI11), and Fenglong (ST40) + Yongquan (KI1). We found that (1) low- or high-frequency EA at different acupoints reduced epileptic seizures (P 0.05 versus the control) with an exception of low-frequency EA at Neiguan (PC6) and Quchi (LI11); (2) low-frequency EA induced a better effect at Fenglong (ST40) plus Yongquan (KI1) than that of the other acupoints (P 0.05); (3) there is no significant difference in the effects of high-frequency EA at these acupoints; and (4) the high-frequency EA elicited a greater effect than that of low-frequency EA in all groups (P 0.05), with an exception at Jinsuo (DU8) + Yaoqi (EXB9). The EA-induced attenuation appeared 1-1.5 hours after EA with no appreciable effect in the first hour after EA in either the EEG or the behavioral tests. We conclude that EA attenuation of epileptic seizures is dependent on the stimulation parameters and acupoints and that the delay in appearance of the EA effect could be a reflection of the time required by the EA signal to regulate neural function in the central nervous system.",Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,0.941037654876709
3,2019,33380304,"Background: There is a complex and interactive relationship between sleep and epilepsy. Sleep disorders are common in patients with epilepsy, and methods for managing sleep disorders in patients with epilepsy are limited. Objective: This review addresses the relationship among sleep, sleep disorders, and epilepsy, focusing on the management of sleep disorders in epilepsy, including some complementary and alternative therapies. Methods: The terms related to ""sleep"" and ""epilepsy"" were searched in ""Pubmed"" and ""Cochrane Library"". Results: Sleep stages differently affect both seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges. Seizures disrupt sleep architecture greatly, especially when occurring during sleep in the night. Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are the most frequent types of comorbid sleep disorders in patients with epilepsy. Pharmacological agents with both anti-convulsant and sedative effects are the priorities for comorbid sleep disorders in epilepsy. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most effective non-pharmacological method to improve OSA and reduce seizures. Complementary and alternative therapies such as Chinese traditional medicine, cognitive behavioral therapy, meditation, yoga, neurofeedback, and acupuncture may have benefits in reducing seizures and improving sleep quality simultaneously by alleviating stress and seizure triggers; however, evidence- based therapies are still deficient.

We performed a randomized controlled trail with two parallel treatment arms at The National Center for Epilepsy in Norway, a comprehensive epilepsy center. Thirty-four patients with long-standing drug resistant epilepsy completed the study. The intervention consisted of 20 acupuncture treatments (bilateral needling of three acupoints plus one or two individually chosen points) or sham acupuncture (bilateral needling with smaller needles of three points outside the traditional meridians) over 8 weeks. The main outcome measures were changes in mean health-related quality of life scores for the two groups after 8 weeks, using the 89-item Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-89) questionnaire. We found no difference between the acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups in score changes in any dimension of the QOLIE-89 questionnaire, despite testing a large number of dimensions. We also found no change in QOLIE-89 scores between baseline and 8 weeks in either groups. In conclusion, we could not demonstrate a significant effect of traditional acupuncture or sham acupuncture on the health-related quality of life of patients with intractable epilepsy.",Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,0.00011112850916106254
5,2019,22231691,"Background: Acupuncture is commonly used to treat migraine. We assessed the efficacy of acupuncture at migraine-specific acupuncture points compared with other acupuncture points and sham acupuncture. Methods: We performed a multicentre, single-blind randomized controlled trial. In total, 480 patients with migraine were randomly assigned to one of four groups (Shaoyang-specific acupuncture, Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture, Yangming-specific acupuncture or sham acupuncture [control]). All groups received 20 treatments, which included electrical stimulation, over a period of four weeks. The primary outcome was the number of days with a migraine experienced during weeks 5-8 after randomization. Our secondary outcomes included the frequency of migraine attack, migraine intensity and migraine-specific quality of life. Results: Compared with patients in the control group, patients in the acupuncture groups reported fewer days with a migraine during weeks 5-8, however the differences between treatments were not significant (p &gt; 0.05). There was a significant reduction in the number of days with a migraine during weeks 13-16 in all acupuncture groups compared with control (Shaoyang-specific acupuncture v. control: difference -1.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.77 to -0.5], p = 0.003; Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture v. control: difference -1.22 [95% CI -1.92 to -0.52], p 0.001; Yangming-specific acupuncture v. control: difference -0.91 [95% CI -1.61 to -0.21], p = 0.011). We found that there was a significant, but not clinically relevant, benefit for almost all secondary outcomes in the three acupuncture groups compared with the control group. We found no relevant differences between the three acupuncture groups.

5,2019,24254036,"Context: Migraine headaches are common, debilitating, underdiagnosed, and undertreated, and medications are not always effective. Research has shown that acupuncture may be an effective and safe adjuvant or alternative migraine treatment. Objective: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether a standardized set of acupuncture points, when used to deliver treatment over a predefined period of time, could reduce the frequency and intensity of migraines. Design: This is a prospective interventional study using set point acupuncture for migraines. Setting: The study took place at Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center in Johnstown, PA, USA. Participants: Participants were 59 individuals with a diagnosis of migraine. Intervention: Acupuncture was administered 2 ×/wk for 4 wks, followed by 1 ×/wk for 4 more wks, using one set of acupoints. Outcome measures: Participants collected daily headache diaries and migraine quality-of-life measurements on a personal digital assistant for 12 wks before starting the acupuncture intervention. Participants continued to record the frequency and intensity of their migraines during the intervention and for an additional 12 wks beyond the intervention. The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS), Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) were completed 4 × during the study: 12 wks prior to the start of the intervention, immediately prior to the first acupuncture treatment, at the end of treatment, and 12 wks after the end of treatment. Results: When preintervention measurements were compared to postintervention measurements, migraine frequency and pain intensity showed a significant decrease (α = 0.05) after acupuncture intervention. Results had not returned to the preintervention baseline even 12 wks after the last acupuncture session. Acupuncture significantly influenced migraine frequency and intensity in the study's participants when preintervention measurements were compared to postintervention measurements. Conclusions: These results indicate that not only did acupuncture decrease both the frequency and intensity of migraines, but also the benefit had not subsided for 12 wks after the final acupuncture session.

5,2019,33184777,"Introduction: Non-pharmacologic alternative therapies for pain have been around for a long time, some for hundreds of years. They have been used throughout history to treat many issues. Recent findings: Currently, alternative medicine is most frequently used to treat musculoskeletal pain, and between 59 and 90% of patients utilizing alternative therapies for chronic pain claimed they were helpful and can serve as an effective adjunctive for the treatment of chronic pain. Some examples of alternative therapies that will be discussed in this review include acupuncture, tai chi, osteopathic manipulation, and chiropractic care. Acupuncture, traditionally a Chinese practice, is becoming more popular across the world to attempt to relieve pain. It involves the placement of thin needles at various points in the body. The efficacy of acupuncture for pain is heavily debated. More research and discussion are necessary to determine the exact role it plays in the treatment of chronic pain. Tai chi is also a traditional Chinese practice that is often used as a form of meditation and for potential health benefits. Tai chi involves a series of complex movements such as squatting combined with deep breathing to achieve relaxation and pain reduction. Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is a technique used by both osteopathic physicians (DO) as well as other health professionals to manage a wide range of conditions in any given patient. The technique involves utilization and manipulation of the musculoskeletal system to achieve potential health benefits. OMT has been used as therapy for many issues but is commonly used for pain conditions. Alternative therapies may serve as an effective adjunctive treatment modality for the management of chronic pain conditions. There has been a tremendous amount of research dictating the effectiveness of alternative therapies for chronic pain management. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive evidence-based update of alternative therapy used for the management of chronic pain conditions.",Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,0.9829062223434448

It is often associated with increased menstrual distress and disability, leading to decreased daily activity and quality of life. A randomized and controlled pilot study was conducted with three groups: verum acupuncture (VA) group, acupressure (AP) group, and control acupuncture (CA) group. The study lasted for 7 cycle-months, with a 1 cycle-month baseline observation (T1), a 3 cycle-month intervention (3 times per cycle-month) (T2-T4), and a 3 cycle-month follow-up (T5-T7). Outcome measures were number of migraine days, average and peak pain, total duration period of MM, and percentage of patients with ≥50% reduction in the number of MM days. Results: A total of 18 participants were included in the analysis (VA, n = 7; AP, n = 6; CA, n = 5). Both VA and AP were significantly more effective than CA for reducing MM days during the intervention period. Both VA and AP tended to be more effective than CA for reducing peak pain during the intervention period. No significant differences for the outcomes were observed among VA, AP, and CA during the follow-up period. No serious adverse events were reported. Discussion: Results of the pilot study suggest that both VA and AP could be considered as alternative and safe prophylactic interventions for MM.

5,2019,30666295,"Background: There were numerous studies using acupuncture for pain relief and in most, the effect of this technique on preventing migraine attacks has been investigated. In those several studies that surveyed the effect of acupuncture on treatment of migraine headaches, the conclusion was not completely persuaded and they suggested further researches on this topic. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of acupuncture on controlling acute migraine attacks. Methods: This study was a single blinded randomized clinical trial that was conducted on patients with a diagnosis of acute migraine attacks. At the time of reference, the patient's pain intensity was measured and recorded in a written checklist. Acupuncture was done in the intervention group with thin metallic needles, which enter certain points in the ear's skin; including shen men, autonomic, thalamus, frontal, and temple. In the placebo group, similar needles were used, however, they were inserted into unusual points. Thereafter, in 30 minutes, one, two, and four hours after the treatment, the pain intensity was also asked and compared with the reference time's score. Results: A total of 60 patients with the mean age of 31.4 ± 7.6 years were enrolled and 83.3% of them were women. There was no significant difference between two groups in terms of the baseline characteristics of participants including age, sex and pain duration before admission (P &gt; 0.05). According to the results, there was a significant difference between the two groups on the checkpoints of 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after acupuncture (P 0.05); however, the pain scores were not statistically different between the two groups on two, three, and four hours after intervention (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Based on the findings of our study, although the pain score was lower in the intervention group than the control group during first hour after the acupuncture, there was no significant change in pain score thereafter.

5,2019,35770540,"Background: Migraine is a very common neurobiological headache disorder caused by an increased irritability of the central nervous system. Acupuncture as a complementary medicine has been suggested as one of the treatments for migraine headaches; however, the findings are conflicting. Objectives: Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of acupuncture with auricular semi-permanent (ASP) needles on migraine headaches. Methods: In this single-blind randomized controlled trial, 80 patients with migraine were selected and divided into two groups. The intervention group was treated with auricular ASP needles in the active points of the ear, and the control group only received routine treatments. Pain score, frequency of migraine headaches, duration of headaches, severity of nausea and vomiting, and patient satisfaction were compared between the two groups for four weeks after the intervention. Results: Our results showed that the level of pain (4.72 ± 2.53, 2.13 ± 1.76 times) and the frequency of migraine headaches (8.98 ± 8.58 hours) from the second week after the intervention in the ASP group were much lower than those in the control group ( p 0.05). However, pain incidence and ear inflammation in the ASP group were negligible and did not differ significantly from those in the control group ( p &gt; 0.05).

5,2019,24171782,"Background: The instant-treatment effect of acupuncture for patients with migraines has been corroborated in numerous studies. However, most diseases are chronic and tend to recur, so the long-term effect of acupuncture can verify the existence of sustained efficacy or the placebo effect. Evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture in the prophylaxis of migraine without aura (MWoA) in China is also important because such studies are lacking. Methods: This trial is a multicenter, prospective, pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial. We will randomly allocate 249 participants to three groups of 83. Patients in the individualized acupoint group will be treated with individualized acupuncture point prescriptions. The non-acupoint control group will undergo insertion of acupuncture needles at four bilateral non-points in locations not corresponding to acupuncture points. The waiting-list control group will not undergo treatment but instead will receive 20 acupuncture treatments for free after a waiting period of 24 weeks. Participants in the individualized acupoint group and non-acupoint control group will receive 20 sessions over four weeks and then all participants will receive 20 weeks of follow-up.

6,2019,28146364,"Amygdalin is a major component of the seeds of Rosaceae family of plants such as apricots, peaches, cherry, nectarines, apples, plums, and so on, as well as almonds. It is used in alternative medicine for cancer prevention, alleviation of fever, cough suppression, and quenching thirst. The aim of the present study is to determine the mutagenic and recombinogenic effects of amygdalin in a test system Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to evaluate its potential antitumor effect in a yeast cell-based test and colon cancer cell lines. Results obtained show that concentrations 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL did not have any cytotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic effect in yeast cell-based tests. Pretreatment with amygdalin at concentration 100 μg/mL leads to around twofold of the cell survival and decrease of reverse mutation frequency, induced by the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate. The frequency of gene conversion and mitotic crossing-over is around threefold lower. The anticarcinogenic potential of amygdalin at the same concentration is presented as around fourfold reduction of Ty1 retrotransposition induced by hexavalent chromium. In summary, data presented in this study provide evidence concerning the inability of amygdalin itself to provoke events related to the initial steps of tumorigenesis. In addition, the observed antimutagenic/antirecombinogenic effect could be activation of error-free and error-prone recombination events. Based on the high selectivity toward normal or tumor cell lines, it could be speculated that amygdalin has higher cytotoxic effect in cell lines with higher proliferative and metabolic activity, which are the majority of fast developing tumors.",Is amygdalin or laetrile an effective cancer treatment?,amygdalin laetrile cancer,0.0,Is amygdalin or laetrile an effective cancer treatment?,0.7380922436714172
6,2019,31610669,"Background: Amygdalin is a natural compound primarily found in seeds of fruit trees. In the human body, it is hydrolyzed to benzaldehyde, glucose, and cyanide, which is considered the active component of amygdalin. The semi-synthetic form of amygdalin is known under the commercial name Laetrile® or as vitamin B17. Purpose: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of studies that evaluated the potential therapeutic effects of amygdalin in oncology. Preclinical studies provided information about the mechanisms of action of amygdalin in vitro and in vivo and its toxicity. Recent in vitro studies demonstrated the effects of amygdalin on the cell cycle, apoptosis, and synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, E-cadherin, and integrins &amp;#946;1 and &amp;#946;4. However, amygdalin exhibited no or low treatment efficiency in preclinical in vivo studies. Conversely, many case studies describe the anti-tumor effects of amygdalin, but these have not been confirmed in clinical trials. Only two clinical studies published almost 40 years ago focused on the safety of amygdalin administered orally and intravenously. Although these studies reported that amygdalin had no benefit in 178 cancer patients, this compound has recently come to the attention of both scientists and patients. The results of recent in vitro studies are promising and indicate that amygdalin has a oncopreventive effect, although this must be confirmed by in vivo studies and clinical trials. Considering its proven toxicity and unconvincing clinical effects, amygdalin cannot currently be recommended to oncology patients as a supportive treatment.",Is amygdalin or laetrile an effective cancer treatment?,amygdalin laetrile cancer,0.0,Is amygdalin or laetrile an effective cancer treatment?,0.27045005559921265
6,2019,1902140,"""Laetrile"" is used interchangeably with ""amygdalin"" to designate natural substances, derived primarily from apricots and almonds, that can release cyanide, which is lethal to living organisms. In the 1920s, Dr. Ernst T. Krebs, Sr., formulated a theory that amygdalin could kill cancer cells. His theory was inconsistent with biochemical facts and has since been modified at least twice by his son, Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. Extensive work has been done by cancer scientists to test the claim that Laetrile fights cancer. Many animal experiments in the 1970s showed a complete lack of tumor killing by Laetrile. Reviews of the medical records of patients whose cancers were claimed to be reduced or cured after Laetrile treatment found insufficient medical evidence to judge Laetrile's efficacy. Finally, in a clinical trial in cancer patients reported in 1982, Laetrile neither caused shrinkage of tumors, nor increased survival time, nor alleviated cancer symptoms, nor enhanced well-being. Several reports in the medical literature document instances in which Laetrile has caused serious, life-threatening toxicity when taken in large doses in the manner prescribed by Laetrile advocates. In light of the lack of efficacy of Laetrile and its demonstrated ability to cause harm, Laetrile should not be used to treat cancer.",Is amygdalin or laetrile an effective cancer treatment?,amygdalin laetrile cancer,0.0,Is amygdalin or laetrile an effective cancer treatment?,8.151127258315682e-05

Still, evidence based research on amygdalin is sparse and its benefit controversial. Purpose: Since so many cancer patients consume amygdalin, and many clinicians administer it without clear knowledge of its mode of action, current knowledge has been summarized and the pros and cons of its use weighed. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted for amygdalin relevant reports using the PubMed database with the main search term ""Amygdalin"" or ""laetrile"", at times combined with ""cancer"", ""patient"", ""cyanide"" or ""toxic"". We did not exclude any ""unwanted"" articles. Additionally, internet sources authorized by governmental or national institutions have also been included. Sections: Individual chapters summarize pharmacokinetics, preclinical and clinical studies and toxicity. Conclusion: No convincing evidence showing that amygdalin induces rapid, distinct tumor regression in cancer patients, particularly in those with late-stage disease, is apparent.

7,2019,12766920,"Background: Ischaemic vascular dementia shares risk factors with stroke. There is evidence that control of these risk factors may prevent or alter the course of vascular dementia. Objective: To assess the effect of regular low-dose aspirin on outcomes for patients with vascular dementia. Design: Retrospective analysis of hospital case-notes with further outcome information from telephone calls to general practitioners, social services and institutions. Comparison of outcomes for aspirin-treated and untreated patients. Setting: One North London NHS Trust. Patients: Seventy-eight patients with clinician's diagnosis of ischaemic vascular dementia, discharged from acute inpatient units between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 1997; 38 on aspirin. Main outcome measures: Survival times from dementia onset to institutionalization and death. Results: Median survival time to institutionalization was 28 months and to death was 52 months. There was no overall difference between aspirin and non-aspirin groups for these outcomes. When data were stratified for social status, i.e. living alone or with carer when last at home, differences emerged for those living with carer. Aspirin was associated with a trend towards increased time to institutionalization (39 vs 22 months, p 0.09) and a significant advantage in time to death (71 vs 27 months, p = 0.02). These effects were non-significant after statistical adjustment for confounding variables. Conclusions: The results support but do not prove a role for regular, low-dose aspirin in improving both life expectancy and survival at home for patients with vascular dementia. Compliance may be better in those living with a carer. Larger, prospective studies should be performed to confirm these findings.

However, a number of queries remain unanswered: Is there convincing evidence that aspirin benefits patients with vascular dementia? Does aspirin affect cognition or improve prognosis? In addition, does the risk of cerebral or gastric haemorrhage outweigh any benefit? Objectives: To assess the evidence of effectiveness of the use of aspirin for vascular dementia. Search strategy: Computerized databases were searched independently by two reviewers. In addition, relevant websites were searched and some journals were handsearched. Specialists in the field were approached for unpublished material and any publications found were searched for additional references. The most recent search for trials was carried out in February 2000. Selection criteria: All randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of aspirin for vascular dementia are included. Inclusion/exclusion of studies comprised systematic assessment of the quality of study design and the risk of bias. Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted independently by both reviewers, using a previously tested data extraction form and, where required, authors were contacted for data not provided in the papers. The aim is to evaluate data recorded via tools assessing cognitive and behavioural changes along with mortality, morbidity and institutionalization data. Main results: No trials are eligible for inclusion in this review. Reviewer's conclusions: There is no evidence that aspirin is effective in treating patients with a diagnosis of vascular dementia. Further research is needed to assess the effect of aspirin on cognition, and on other outcomes such as behaviour, and quality of life. At present there is no evidence relating to other queries about the use of aspirin for dementia (these are described in the Background section of this review).

7,2019,12827329,"Objective: It has been reported that aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) may protect against dementia of Alzheimer's type and/or vascular dementia. However, co-morbidity and the dose of aspirin may be critical. A major indication for low-dose aspirin is prophylaxis after stroke and transient ischaemic attacks, conditions that may obscure an anti-dementia effect by the drug. Alternatively, low-dose aspirin may be insufficient if the protective effect is due to an anti-inflammatory mechanism. The aim of this study was to assess whether high-dose or low-dose aspirin may protect against Alzheimer's dementia in subjects aged &gt; or =80 years. For comparison, effects of (other) NSAID, paracetamol and D-propoxyphene were studied. Methods: Global, cross-sectional, and longitudinal (1991-2000) epidemiological analyses of clinical, cognitive and drug treatment data on 702 individuals 80 years old or more (351 twin pairs of same sex), all alive at inclusion: mean age 83.9 years (80-99 years). Calculations were made with logistic regression of associations between use of various analgesics and cognitive function, after adjustment for age, gender, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Results: Users of high-dose aspirin had significantly lower prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia and better-maintained cognitive function than non-users. There were numerically similar but not significant associations with use of low-dose aspirin and other NSAID. There were no such associations with use of either paracetamol or D-propoxyphene.

7,2019,33483830,"Purpose: People with dementia may have indications for aspirin prescription and clinicians are asked to balance the potential risks against benefits. This review examines the evidence for the risk and benefit of long-term aspirin use in people with dementia aged over 65 years, including randomised controlled trials and observational studies. Methods: We searched three databases for research published between 2007 and 2020. Each eligible article was assessed for risk of bias, and confidence in findings was rated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Results: Four papers met inclusion criteria: one randomised controlled trial, two cohort studies, and one with pooled data. All looked only at dementia of Alzheimer's type, and none addressed myocardial or cerebral infarction as outcomes. Dementia progression was reported by two studies, with conflicting results. The trial found no significant effect of aspirin on mortality (odds ratio aspirin vs. no aspirin 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.58-1.97) but found more events of severe bleeding with aspirin (OR aspirin vs. no aspirin 6.9, 1.5-31.2). An excess in intracranial haemorrhage in the aspirin group was judged plausible based on two non-randomised studies. Conclusions: The review findings are limited because studies include only people with Alzheimer's-type dementia and lack confirmatory studies, although an increased risk of bleeding events is recognised.

7,2019,33613260,"Background: More people with cognitive dysfunction and dementia also fall into the category of high vascular risk, for which aspirin is one of the most frequently used drugs. However, previous studies reporting that aspirin buffers against mild cognitive decline (MCI) and dementia remain controversial. We thus conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of aspirin use with the risk of MCI and dementia in older adults. Methods: Data sources from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database for randomized controlled trails (RCTs) and cohort studies (published between January 1, 2000 and April 11, 2020). Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to pool data on the occurrence of dementia and MCI with random-effects models. Results: Of 3,193 identified articles, 15 studies (12 cohort studies and three RCTs) were eligible and were included in our analysis, which involved a total of 100,909 participants without cognitive dysfunctions or dementia at baseline.

8,2019,18342269,"Each year millions of travelers undertake long distance flights over one or more continents. These multiple time zone flights produce a constellation of symptoms known as jet lag. Familiar to almost every intercontinental traveler is the experience of fatigue upon arrival in a new time zone, but almost as problematic are a number of other jet lag symptoms. These include reduced alertness, nighttime insomnia, loss of appetite, depressed mood, poor psychomotor coordination and reduced cognitive skills, all symptoms which are closely affected by both the length and direction of travel. The most important jet lag symptoms are due to disruptions to the body's sleep/wake cycle. Clinical and pathophysiological studies also indicate that jet lag can exacerbate existing affective disorders. It has been suggested that dysregulation of melatonin secretion and occurrence of circadian rhythm disturbances may be the common links which underlie jet lag and affective disorders. Largely because of its regulatory effects on the circadian system, melatonin has proven to be highly effective for treating the range of symptoms that accompany transmeridian air travel. Additionally, it has been found to be of value in treating mood disorders like seasonal affective disorder. Melatonin acts on MT(1) and MT(2) melatonin receptors located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei, the site of the body's master circadian clock. Melatonin resets disturbed circadian rhythms and promotes sleep in jet lag and other circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including delayed sleep phase syndrome and shift-work disorder. Although post-flight melatonin administration works efficiently in transmeridian flights across less than 7-8 times zones, in the case longer distances, melatonin should be given by 2-3 days in advance to the flight. To deal with the unwanted side effects which usually accompany this pre-departure treatment (acute soporific and sedative effects in times that may not be wanted), the suppression of circadian rhythmicity by covering symmetrically the phase delay and the phase advance portions of the phase response curve for light, together with the administration of melatonin at local bedtime to resynchronize the circadian oscillator, have been proposed. The current view that sleep loss is a major cause of jet lag has focused interest on two recently developed pharmacological agents. Ramelteon and agomelatine are melatonin receptor agonists which, compared to melatonin itself, have a longer half-life and greater affinity for melatonin receptors and consequently are thought to hold promise for treating a variety of circadian disruptions.",Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,0.661658525466919

Method: This was a randomized, double-blind trial of placebo and three alternative regimens of melatonin (5.0 mg at bedtime, 0.5 mg at bedtime, and 0.5 mg taken on a shifting schedule) for jet lag. The subjects were 257 Norwegian physicians who had visited New York for 5 days. Jet lag ratings were made on the day of travel from New York back to Oslo (6 hours eastward) and for the next 6 days in Norway.

Results: There was a marked increase in total jet lag score in all four treatment groups on the first day at home, followed by progressive improvement over the next 5 days. However, there were no significant group differences or group-by-time interactions. In addition, there was no group effect for sleep onset, time of awakening, hours slept, or hours napping. Ratings on a summary jet lag item were highly correlated with total jet lag scores (from a low of r = 0.54 on the day of travel to a high of r = 0.80 on day 3).

Objectives: To determine which interventions are used to prevent back and neck pain problems as well as what the evidence is for their utility. Summary of background data: Given the difficulty in successfully treating long-term back and neck pain problems, there has been a call for preventive interventions. Little is known, however, about the value of preventive efforts for nonpatients, e.g., in the general population or workplace. Methods: The literature was systematically searched to locate all investigations that were: 1) specifically designed as a preventive intervention; 2) randomized or nonrandomized controlled trials; and, 3) using subjects not seeking treatment. Outcome was evaluated on the key variables of reported pain, report of injury, dysfunction, time off work, health-care utilization, and cost. Conclusions were drawn using a grading system. Results: Twenty-seven investigations meeting the criteria were found for educational efforts, lumbar supports, exercises, ergonomics, and risk factor modification. For back schools, only one of the nine randomized trials reported a significant effect, and there was strong evidence that back schools are not effective in prevention. Because the randomized trials concerning lumbar supports were consistently negative, there is strong evidence that they are not effective in prevention. Exercises, conversely, showed stable positive results in randomized controlled trials, giving consistent evidence of relatively moderate utility in prevention. Because no properly controlled trials were found for ergonomic interventions or risk factor modification, there was not good quality evidence available to draw a conclusion. Conclusions: The results concerning prevention for subjects not seeking medical care are sobering. Only exercises provided sufficient evidence to conclude that they are an effective preventive intervention. There is a dire lack of controlled trials examining broad-based multidimensional programs.

Results: The results were analyzed with the Wilcoxon test, showing a decrease not only in pain (p 0.01), but an improvement in weight, flexibility and perception of disability due to the Oswestry scale (p 0.01) showing that the series of exercises proposed is an alternative to the management of low back pain. Discussion: It is recommended the presence of a therapist who accompanies and corrects the postures so that the exercises are performed well, as well as giving value to the degree of disability caused by pain in the daily performance of the people who present it.",Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,0.8670165538787842
11,2019,29238262,"The present study aimed to analyze the impacts of a low back rehabilitation program accompanied with neck, shoulder and upper back exercises on pain, disability, and physical characteristics of patients with chronic low back pain. Twenty sedentary male patients with chronic low back pain participated in the study on a voluntary basis. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups: a conventional low back exercise group (CE) and a supported exercise group (SE; CE plus upper back, neck, and shoulder exercises). The Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (MODQ) was used to evaluate the disability status and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to identify the pain states of the patients. In addition, neck, lumbar and shoulder isokinetic and isometric strengths of the patients were evaluated. The CE group performed lumbar stretching, mobilization and stabilization exercises in addition to low-back and abdominal isometric and concentric strengthening exercises. The SE group performed static stretching and isotonic exercises for the neck, upper-back, and shoulder muscles, in addition to the exercises performed in CE group. The exercises were implemented 3 days a week for 6 weeks in both groups. Following the 6-week exercise periods in both groups, statistically significant (p 0.01) improvements were observed in the patients' levels of pain and the scores of MODQ reflecting an easing of disability. With respect to the levels of pain and disability, the improvements observed in the SE group was significantly (p 0.01) greater than the improvement observed in the CE group. Based on the findings of this study, we can conclude that a low back exercise program used in combination with neck, shoulder and upper back exercises reduces the level of pain and disability in patients with chronic low back pain more prominently than conventional low back exercises.",Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,0.9370545744895935
11,2019,27807526,"The beneficial effects of a strength exercise program and a combined exercise program of strength training plus walking were examined in overweight with chronic back pain patients. The participants were randomly placed in the strength exercise group (SEG, n=15), combined exercise group (CEG, n=15), and control group (CG, n=6). All subjects performed exercise twice per week, 50 min per session with a professional instructors for 12 weeks. In order to evaluate exercise intervention effects, lumbar function was measured by back strength and flexibility. Roland-Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ) and visual analogue scale (VAS) were used to evaluate pain level. Fat and muscle mass were measured to compare body composition changes. All measurements were performed before and after 12 weeks of exercise program. Lumbar function: Back strength was significantly different over time, and significant time×group differences were found between SEG and CG and, CEG and CG. Pain disorder degree: VAS showed a significant group difference, and significant time×group differences were shown between SEG and CG, and CEG and CG. Also, RMDG showed a significant difference between CEG and CG. Body composition: Fat mass was significantly different over time×group between SEG and CG. In conclusion, participating in strength and walking exercises were beneficial to improve lumbar function. Also, the combined exercise program was more effective for reducing pain levels than the strength exercise. Finally, fat mass was reduced in this study and this may play a possible role in the improvement of lumbar function and reduction in low back pain.",Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,0.9763039946556091
12,2019,20543611,"Purpose of review: Three large trials among African heterosexual men in the last decade have confirmed that male circumcision reduces HIV acquisition. This review summarizes recent data regarding circumcision performed primarily to reduce HIV in high-prevalence settings. Recent findings: Male circumcision more than halved the acquisition of HIV in the trials, and was associated with few adverse events and high levels of satisfaction. An additional trial found no direct reduction in HIV risk for female partners of circumcised men. Evidence for an HIV-protective effect of circumcision in men who have sex with men is weak and inconclusive. Acquisition of HSV-2 and high-risk human papillomavirus are both reduced in circumcised heterosexual men, whereas acquisition of common male urethral pathogens are not. Concerns exist that behavioural disinhibition could offset benefits of this intervention, and it remains to be seen whether the low rate of adverse events and adoption of safer sexual practices observed in the trials will be maintained in circumcision programmes outside trial settings. Summary: The evidence that circumcision reduces HIV in African heterosexual men is clear.

A systematic literature review was conducted searching for studies that assessed male circumcision as a method to prevent HIV acquisition in homosexual and/or heterosexual men. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched in March 2017. A random effects model was used to calculate a pooled risk ratio (RR) and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI). In total, 49 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The overall pooled RR for both homosexual and heterosexual men was 0.58 (95% CI 0.48-0.70), suggesting that circumcision was associated with a reduction in HIV risk. Circumcision was found to be protective for both homosexual and heterosexual men (RR: 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.92 and 0.28, 95% CI 0.14-0.59, respectively).

Moreover, literature shows that men have insufficient knowledge about reproductive health matters and some misconceptions about modern contraceptive practices. Objectives: The aim of the study was to describe reproductive health knowledge of men in Mankweng District and was conducted in 2015. Methods: A descriptive research study was conducted by using quantitative approach. Data were collected by means of questionnaires. Cluster random multistage sampling was used to select villages in Mankweng District and convenient sampling was used to identify participants who met the inclusion criteria to participate on the study. Results: A total of 200 questionnaires were distributed and returned; 197 (98.5%) of the returned questionnaires were eligible for analysis. The findings indicated that the majority of participants, 74% (n = 145), considered their partners to be unclean during menstruation, and 84.77% (n = 167) of participants did not know how to perform self-testicular examination. More than half of the participants, 55.83% (n = 67), were not in favour of vasectomy and had strong opinions about it; some of those who reportedly knew what a vasectomy involves had some misconceptions. Conclusion: The findings showed that despite participants' reported knowledge about some reproductive health matters their perceptions were unfavourable towards them. Despite men's sufficient knowledge about sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and ways to protect themselves against STIs men had limited knowledge about other male and female reproductive health matters.",Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,0.09955812245607376
12,2019,19086815,"Background: Male circumcision has received international attention as an intervention for reducing HIV infection among high-risk heterosexual men; however, few US studies have evaluated its association with the risk of HIV infection. Methods: We analyzed visit records for heterosexual African American men who underwent HIV testing while attending sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in Baltimore, Maryland, from 1993 to 2000. We used multivariable binomial regression to evaluate associations between circumcision and the risk of HIV infection among visits by patients with known and unknown HIV exposure. Results: Overall, 1096 (2.7%) of 40,571 clinic visits yielded positive HIV test results. Among 394 visits by patients with known HIV exposure, circumcision was significantly associated with lower HIV prevalence (10.2% vs. 22.0%; adjusted prevalence rate ratio [PRR], 0.49 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.93]). Conversely, among 40,177 visits by patients with unknown HIV exposure, circumcision was not associated with reduced HIV prevalence (2.5% vs. 3.3%; adjusted PRR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.86-1.15]), and age &gt;or=25 years old and diagnosis of ulcerative STD were associated with increased prevalence.

Methods: We interviewed presumed-HIV negative MSM at gay pride events in 2006. We asked uncircumcised respondents about willingness to be circumcised if it were proven to reduce risk of HIV among MSM and perceived barriers to circumcision. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify covariates associated with willingness to be circumcised. Results: Of 780 MSM, 133 (17%) were uncircumcised. Of these, 71 (53%) were willing to be circumcised. Willingness was associated with black race (exact odds ratio [OR]: 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-9.8), non-injection drug use (OR: 6.1, 95% CI: 1.8-23.7) and perceived reduced risk of penile cancer (OR: 4.7, 95% CI: 2.0-11.9). The most commonly endorsed concerns about circumcision were post-surgical pain and wound infection.

In this Review, we summarise the evidence for a direct effect of male circumcision on the risk of women becoming infected with HIV. We identified 19 epidemiological analyses, from 11 study populations, of the association of male circumcision and HIV risk in women. A random-effects meta-analysis of data from the one randomised controlled trial and six longitudinal analyses showed little evidence that male circumcision directly reduces risk of HIV in women (summary relative risk 0.80, 95% CI 0.53-1.36). Definitive data would come from a further randomised controlled trial of circumcision among men infected with HIV in serodiscordant heterosexual relationships, but this would involve enrolling about 10 000 couples and is likely to be logistically unfeasible. As circumcision services for HIV prevention are scaled-up in high HIV prevalence settings, rapid integration with existing prevention strategies would maximise benefits for both men and women.

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and World Health Organization have recently announced recommendations to scale up male circumcision in countries with generalized epidemics and low levels of male circumcision. However, no meta-analysis has been conducted to determine the effectiveness of this intervention. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of medical literature, and included any RCTs assessing male circumcision to prevent heterosexually acquired HIV infection among males. We used the DerSimonian-Laird random effects method to pool study outcomes. We calculated the relative risk (RR), risk difference, number needed to treat (NNT) and I(2), all with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: We identified three RCTs that met our inclusion criteria, involving a total of 11 050 men. The pooled RR was 0.44 (95% CI 0.33-0.60, P 0.0001, I(2)=0%, 95% CI 0-35%). The risk difference was 0.014 (95% CI 0.07-0.21), yielding a NNT of 72 (95% CI 50-143). Conclusions: Male circumcision is an effective strategy for reducing new male HIV infections.

12,2019,19370585,"Background: Male circumcision is defined as the surgical removal of all or part of the foreskin of the penis and may be practiced as part of a religious ritual, as a medical procedure, or as part of a traditional ritual performed as an initiation into manhood. Since the 1980s, over 30 observational studies have suggested a protective effect of male circumcision on HIV acquisition in heterosexual men. In 2002, three randomised controlled trials to assess the efficacy of male circumcision for preventing HIV acquisition in men commenced in Africa. This review evaluates the results of these trials, which analysed the effectiveness and safety of male circumcision for preventing acquisition of HIV in heterosexual men. Objectives: To assess the evidence of an interventional effect of male circumcision for preventing acquisition of HIV-1 and HIV-2 by men through heterosexual intercourse Search strategy: We formulated a comprehensive and exhaustive search strategy in an attempt to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress). In June 2007 we searched the following electronic journal and trial databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. We also searched the electronic conference databases NLM Gateway and AIDSearch and the trials registers ClinicalTrials.gov and Current Controlled Trials. We contacted researchers and relevant organizations and checked reference lists of all included studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of male circumcision versus no circumcision in HIV-negative heterosexual men with HIV incidence as the primary outcome. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and graded methodological quality. Data extraction and methodological quality were checked by a third author who resolved differences when these arose. Data were considered clinically homogeneous and meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed. Main results: Three large RCTs of men from the general population were conducted in South Africa (N = 3 274), Uganda (N = 4 996) and Kenya (N = 2 784) between 2002 and 2006. All three trials were stopped early due to significant findings at interim analyses. We combined the survival estimates for all three trials at 12 months and also at 21 or 24 months in a meta-analysis using available case analyses using the random effects model. The resultant incidence risk ratio (IRR) was 0.50 at 12 months with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.34 to 0.72; and 0.46 at 21 or 24 months (95% CI: 0.34 to 0.62). These IRRs can be interpreted as a relative risk reduction of acquiring HIV of 50% at 12 months and 54% at 21 or 24 months following circumcision. There was little statistical heterogeneity between the trial results (chi(2) = 0.60; df = 2; p = 0.74 and chi(2) = 0.31; df = 2; p = 0.86) with the degree of heterogeneity quantified by the I(2) at 0% in both analyses. We investigated the sensitivity of the calculated IRRs and conducted meta-analyses of the reported IRRs, the reported per protocol IRRs, and reported full intention-to-treat analysis. The results obtained did not differ markedly from the available case meta-analysis, with circumcision displaying significant protective effects across all analyses.We conducted a meta-analysis of the secondary outcomes measuring sexual behaviour for the Kenyan and Ugandan trials and found no significant differences between circumcised and uncircumcised men. For the South African trial the mean number of sexual contacts at the 12-month visit was 5.9 in the circumcision group versus 5 in the control group, which was a statistically significant difference (p 0.001). This difference remained statistically significant at the 21-month visit (7.5 versus 6.4; p = 0.0015). No other significant differences were observed.Incidence of adverse events following the surgical circumcision procedure was low in all three trials.Reporting of methodological quality was variable across the three trials, but overall, the potential for significant biases affecting the trial results was judged to be low to moderate given the large sample sizes of the trials, the balance of possible confounding variables across randomised groups at baseline in all three trials, and the employment of acceptable statistical early stopping rules. Authors' conclusions: There is strong evidence that medical male circumcision reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38% and 66% over 24 months. Incidence of adverse events is very low, indicating that male circumcision, when conducted under these conditions, is a safe procedure. Inclusion of male circumcision into current HIV prevention measures guidelines is warranted, with further research required to assess the feasibility, desirability, and cost-effectiveness of implementing the procedure within local contexts.",Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,0.5414091348648071
12,2019,19335172,"Male circumcision can reduce the risk of HIV acquisition among heterosexual men, but its effectiveness is uncertain in men who have sex with men (MSM). Additionally, its acceptability among Chinese men is unknown given a lack of history and cultural norms endorsing neonatal and adult circumcision. This study evaluated the willingness to participate in a clinical trial of circumcision among 328 Chinese MSM. Some 11.6% respondents reported having been circumcised, most of them due to a tight foreskin. Of 284 uncircumcised MSM, 16.9% said they were absolutely willing to participate, 26.4% were probably, 28.9% were probably not, and 27.8% were absolutely not; 81% said male circumcision would help maintain genital hygiene. The major motivators for willingness to participate included contribution to AIDS scientific research and getting free medical service. Men also had concerns about ineffectiveness of circumcision in reducing HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) risks and side effects of the surgery. Those who did not have a Beijing resident card (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-3.38), did not find sexual partners through the Internet (AOR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.21-3.75), and were not concerned about the effectiveness of circumcision (AOR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.34-4.19) were more likely to be willing to participate in a trial.

A literature synthesis was performed to determine whether antidepressants are more effective than placebos in decreasing pain, disability, depression, and analgesic medication use in such patients. Methods: English-language journal articles were identified from MEDLINE and PsycLIT databases, bibliographies, and inquiries to researchers and drug companies. Articles were included if they reported data from placebo-controlled or drug comparison trials of antidepressants for patients with low back pain. Six articles met these criteria. Results: Three studies compared the effects of antidepressants and placebos on pain; two found no difference and one found a trend toward superiority of imipramine for patient-rated symptoms but no difference in investigator ratings. Effects on functional disability were examined in three antidepressant-placebo comparisons; only one found the antidepressant to be more effective. Antidepressant effects of an antidepressant vs placebo were compared in three studies; none found a significant difference. Effects on analgesic medication use were compared in three studies; one found amitriptyline to be superior and the others found no difference. Serious methodologic flaws characterized all six studies, and insufficient reporting of data precluded meta-analysis.

A comprehensive overview of the evidence on pharmacological treatment options for chronic low back pain is lacking. This review evaluates the evidence for the benefits and risks of currently available pharmacological treatments for chronic low back pain. Areas covered: The authors focus on the recent (Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials covering paracetamol (acetaminophen), NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, opioids, and other (new) drugs. Expert opinion: The overall impression of the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for patients with chronic low back pain is rather sobering. The effects on pain reduction and improvement of function are commonly small to moderate and short lasting when compared to placebo. At the same time, the various types of drugs are not without side-effects. This holds especially true for serious side-effects associated with (prolonged) use of strong opioids.

The efficacy, acceptability, and safety of antidepressant medicines for low back pain (LBP) are not clear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of antidepressant medicines for LBP. Methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov , the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform from inception to May 2020. We included published and trial registry reports of RCTs that allocated adult participants with LBP to receive an antidepressant medicine or a placebo medicine. Pairs of authors independently extracted data in duplicate. We extracted participant characteristics, study sample size, outcome values, and measures of variance for each outcome. We data using random-effects meta-analysis models and calculated estimates of effects and heterogeneity for each outcome. We formed judgments of confidence in the evidence in accordance with GRADE. We report our findings in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We prespecified all outcomes in a prospectively registered protocol. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and acceptability. We measured pain intensity at end-of-treatment on a 0-100 point scale and considered 10 points the minimal clinically important difference. We defined acceptability as the odds of stopping treatment for any reason. Results: We included 23 RCTs in this review. Data were available for pain in 17 trials and acceptability in 14 trials. Treatment with antidepressants decreased pain intensity by 4.33 points (95% CI - 6.15 to - 2.50) on a 0-100 scale, compared to placebo. Treatment with antidepressants increased the odds of stopping treatment for any reason (OR 1.27 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.56]), compared to placebo. Conclusions: Treatment of LBP with antidepressants is associated with small reductions in pain intensity and increased odds of stopping treatment for any reason, compared to placebo. The effect on pain is not clinically important. The effect on acceptability warrants consideration. These findings provide Level I evidence to guide clinicians in their use of antidepressants to treat LBP.

Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials that compared antidepressant medication and placebo for patients with non-specific low-back pain, and used at least one clinically relevant outcome measure. Data collection and analysis: Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the trials. Meta-analyses were used to examine the effect of antidepressants on pain, depression and function, and the effect of antidepressant type on pain. To account for studies that could not be pooled, additional qualitative analyses were performed using the levels of evidence recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. Main results: Ten trials that compared antidepressants with placebo were included in this review. The pooled analyses showed no difference in pain relief (six trials; standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to 0.16)) or depression (two trials; SMD 0.06 (95% CI -0.29 to 0.40)) between antidepressant and placebo treatments. The qualitative analyses found conflicting evidence on the effect of antidepressants on pain intensity in chronic low-back pain, and no clear evidence that antidepressants reduce depression in chronic low-back pain patients. Two pooled analyses showed no difference in pain relief between different types of antidepressants and placebo. Our findings were not altered by the sensitivity analyses which varied the level of methodological quality required for inclusion in the meta-analyses to allow data from additional trials to be examined.

Antidepressant medication is often prescribed, especially for chronic back discomfort, to alleviate pain and restore the patient's ability to conduct activities of daily living. Objective: To assess the efficacy of antidepressants in treating back pain in adults. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE (1966-2000), PsycLit, Cinhal, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, HealthSTAR, CANCERLIT, the Cochrane Library (clinical trials registry and the Database of Systematic Reviews), Micromedex, and Federal Research in Progress databases and references of reviewed articles. Included articles were written in English and dealt with randomized placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant medication use among adults with chronic back pain. Two reviewers abstracted data independently. Two continuous outcomes, change in back pain severity and ability to perform activities of daily living, were measured. Study quality was assessed with the methods used by Jadad and colleagues, and data were synthesized using a random-effects model. Results: Nine randomized controlled trials with 10 treatment arms and 504 patients were included. Seven treatment arms included patients with major depression. Patients had chronic back pain, averaging 10.4 years. Patients treated with antidepressants were more likely to improve in pain severity than those taking placebo (standardized mean difference, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.61) but not in activities of daily living (standardized mean difference, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, -0.21-0.69).

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the Antidepressants treatment effects on low back pain published in English language were included. There was no limitation on the type of Antidepressants drugs, clinical setting, and study population, while non-systematical reviews and qualitative and narrative reviews were excluded. Results: A total of 25 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were evaluated; the studies were reported between 1992 and 2017. Obtained results from AMSTAR2 showed that 11 (44%), 9 (36%) and 5 (20%) of the included studies had high, moderate and low qualities, respectively. 13(52%) of studies assessed risk of bias and 2(20%) of meta analyses considered publication bias. Also, 16 (64%) of the included reviews provided a satisfactory explanation for any heterogeneity observed in the results. Conclusions: Although the trend of publishing high quality papers in ADs effect on LBP increased recently, performing more high-quality SRs and MAs in this field with precise subgroups of the type of pains, the class of drugs and their dosages may give clear and more reliable evidence to help clinicians and policymakers.",Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,antidepressants low-back pain,0.0,Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,0.8941574692726135
13,2019,20205483,"Low back pain is one of the most common conditions encountered in clinical practice and medications are the most commonly used type of treatment. In most patients, low back pain is nonspecific, in that the pain cannot be reliably attributed to a specific condition or abnormality in the back. Although a number of medications are available to treat nonspecific low back pain, selecting a therapy can be a challenge because each one is associated with a unique set of benefits and harms. In addition, the evidence supporting the use of different medications varies, and issues such as costs and patient preferences may also affect treatment choices. A guideline published in 2007 from the American Pain Society and the American College of Physicians on diagnosis and treatment of low back pain includes recommendations on the use of medications, based on the quality of supporting evidence and the estimated magnitude of benefits relative to harms. For most patients with low back pain, regardless of the duration of symptoms, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and NSAIDs are first-line options for pain relief. Opioids are more potent analgesics, but are not a first-line option due to their abuse potential. Skeletal muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines can be used as adjunctive medications for acute low back pain, but have a high incidence of sedation. Tricyclic antidepressants may be an option for chronic low back pain, but their effects on pain appear small or uncertain. Nonetheless, depression is common in patients with low back pain and should be treated appropriately. When choosing medications for treatment of low back pain, practice guidelines provide a useful starting point for making decisions, but clinicians should base therapeutic choices on individualized consideration and discussion with patients regarding the potential benefits and risks.",Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,antidepressants low-back pain,0.0,Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,0.8720952272415161
13,2019,33665090,"Background: Low back pain (LBP) is expected to globally affect up to 80% of individuals at some point during their lifetime. While conventional LBP therapies are effective, they may result in adverse side-effects. It is thus common for patients to seek information about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) online to either supplement or even replace their conventional LBP care. The present study sought to assess the quality of web-based consumer health information available at the intersection of LBP and CAM. Methods: We searched Google using six unique search terms across four English-speaking countries. Eligible websites contained consumer health information in the context of CAM for LBP. We used the DISCERN instrument, which consists of a standardized scoring system with a Likert scale from one to five across 16 questions, to conduct a quality assessment of websites. Results: Across 480 websites identified, 32 were deemed eligible and assessed using the DISCERN instrument. The mean overall rating across all websites 3.47 (SD = 0.70); Summed DISCERN scores across all websites ranged from 25.5-68.0, with a mean of 53.25 (SD = 10.41); the mean overall rating across all websites 3.47 (SD = 0.70). Most websites reported the benefits of numerous CAM treatment options and provided relevant information for the target audience clearly, but did not adequately report the risks or adverse side-effects adequately. Conclusion: Despite some high-quality resources identified, our findings highlight the varying quality of consumer health information available online at the intersection of LBP and CAM.

13,2019,24460577,"Objectives: To contrast the analgesic effect of duloxetine with antidepressants reported in other published randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and review articles in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Methods: In this narrative review, the results of 13 RCTs and 5 systematic reviews examining the analgesic effect of various antidepressants in CLBP were contrasted with those of 3 placebo-controlled duloxetine RCTs. Treatment effects based on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) average score in the duloxetine RCTs were assessed in all completers (by study and overall) and in last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) analyses (extracted from study reports). 30%- and 50%-reduction response rates were compared between duloxetine and placebo. Results: Eleven different antidepressants were examined in 13 individual RCTs. Sample sizes, treatment durations, and analysis methods varied across studies. Reviews each included 5 to 9 of the RCTs and came to different conclusions regarding the analgesic effect of antidepressants: 2 found no evidence while 3 reported some evidence. The completer analysis showed greater improvements in BPI average scores with duloxetine vs. placebo (significant in 2 studies). Overall, the least square mean (standard error) difference between treatments was - 0.7 (0.15) (P 0.0001). Overall response rates were significantly larger with duloxetine than with placebo. Conclusions: Due to the diversity of previous studies and the pooling methods used, the conclusions regarding the analgesic effect of antidepressants in CLBP drawn from systematic reviews must be interpreted with caution.

13,2019,29913734,"Background and aims Patients seeking care for a pain problem very often also report symptoms of depression.In fact, depression is associated with the development of chronic pain as well as poor treatment results. Yet, the mechanisms by which depression and pain impact upon one another are not clear. This paper provides a critical review of the literature with the aim of shedding light on the relationship between pain and depression. Further, we introduce the Örebro Behavioral Emotion Regulation Model which may stimulate understanding in addition to research. Method Data bases (MedLine and PsychINFO) were searched as well as reference lists to locate relevant articles, especially previous reviews, published since 2000. We located 244 articles including 6 reviews. Results We found that while depression is strongly linked to pain, there is little understanding of how this link works or how it might be utilized in clinical settings. It is not clear whether one of the symptoms precedes the other, but when both are present prognosis is significantly affected. Clinicians often fail to assess both depression and pain resulting in probable ""under"" treatment of one or both problems. There is little evidence that treating the pain will result in the disappearance of the depression. Indeed, early improvements in depression are associated with overall treatment gains for patients with musculoskeletal pain. Therefore, treatment outcomes might be substantially enhanced by addressing both the pain and the depression. Moreover, directly addressing the depression early in treatment may be especially valuable. While pharmacological treatments of depression are often pursued for pain patients, the results for depression, pain and function are not impressive. Although there are effective cognitive-behavioral techniques for depression, these have not been properly evaluated in patients with co-morbid pain and depression. We found two likely mechanisms that can help to explain the link between depression and pain. First, catastrophizing plays a central role in models of both pain and depression and hence might form an important link between them. Second, emotion regulation is important in both depression and pain since they both can be viewed as significant emotional stressors. We offer a model which focuses on the recurrent nature of pain and depression. It hypothesizes that flare-ups trigger catastrophic worry which in turn strains the individual's emotion regulation system. Successful behavioral emotion regulation is said to result in coping while negative behavioral emotion regulation results in spiraling negative affect, pain and mood related disability and, in the long term, a consequent relapse. Implications Since both pain and depression are closely linked and are both involved in the development of long-term problems, it is important for clinicians to assess them as early as possible. Moreover, both symptoms should be monitored and addressed in treatment to maximize outcome results. Because pharmacological treatment has limited effects, cognitive-behavioral therapy is an alternative. Behavioral emotion regulation may be an important mechanism linking depression and pain. Conclusions It is concluded that pain and depression impact on each other and play an important role in the development and maintenance of chronic problems. Future studies of treatments for co-morbid depression and pain are urgently required. The purposed Örebro Behavioral Emotion Regulation Model provides much needed guidance for investigating the psychological mechanisms involved.",Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,antidepressants low-back pain,0.0,Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,0.8810628056526184
16,2019,32956536,"Background: Skeletal muscle cramps are common and often occur in association with pregnancy, advanced age, exercise or motor neuron disorders (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Typically, such cramps have no obvious underlying pathology, and so are termed idiopathic. Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps but the efficacy of magnesium for this purpose remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012, and performed to identify and incorporate more recent studies. Objectives: To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation compared to no treatment, placebo control or other cramp therapies in people with skeletal muscle cramps. SEARCH METHODS: On 9 September 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and SPORTDiscus. We also searched WHO-ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov for registered trials that might be ongoing or unpublished, and ISI Web of Science for studies citing the studies included in this review. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of magnesium supplementation (in any form) to prevent skeletal muscle cramps in any patient group (i.e. all clinical presentations of cramp). We considered comparisons of magnesium with no treatment, placebo control, or other therapy. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Two review authors assessed risk of bias. We attempted to contact all study authors when questions arose and obtained participant-level data for four of the included trials, one of which was unpublished. We collected all data on adverse effects from the included RCTs. Main results: We identified 11 trials (nine parallel-group, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 735 individuals, amongst whom 118 cross-over participants additionally served as their own controls. Five trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps (408 participants) and five trials enrolled people with idiopathic cramps (271 participants, with 118 additionally crossed over to control). Another study enrolled 29 people with liver cirrhosis, only some of whom suffered muscle cramps. All trials provided magnesium as an oral supplement, except for one trial which provided magnesium as a series of slow intravenous infusions. Nine trials compared magnesium to placebo, one trial compared magnesium to no treatment, calcium carbonate or vitamin B, and another trial compared magnesium to vitamin E or calcium. We judged the single trial in people with liver cirrhosis and all five trials in participants with pregnancy-associated leg cramps to be at high risk of bias. In contrast, we rated the risk of bias high in only one of five trials in participants with idiopathic rest cramps. For idiopathic cramps, largely in older adults (mean age 61.6 to 69.3 years) presumed to have nocturnal leg cramps (the commonest presentation), differences in measures of cramp frequency when comparing magnesium to placebo were small, not statistically significant, and showed minimal heterogeneity (I² = 0% to 12%). This includes the primary endpoint, percentage change from baseline in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (mean difference (MD) -9.59%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -23.14% to 3.97%; 3 studies, 177 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the difference in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (MD -0.18 cramps/week, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.49; 5 studies, 307 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 3 studies, 177 participants; high-certainty evidence). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found at four weeks in measures of cramp intensity or cramp duration. This includes the number of participants rating their cramps as moderate or severe at four weeks (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.21; 2 studies, 91 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the percentage of participants with the majority of cramp durations of one minute or more at four weeks (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.53, 1 study, 46 participants; low-certainty evidence). We were unable to perform meta-analysis for trials of pregnancy-associated leg cramps. The single study comparing magnesium to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a three-point ordinal scale of overall treatment efficacy. Of the three trials comparing magnesium to placebo, one found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures, another found benefit for both, and a third reported inconsistent results for frequency that could not be reconciled. The single study in people with liver cirrhosis was small and had limited reporting of cramps, but found no difference in terms of cramp frequency or cramp intensity. Our analysis of adverse events pooled all studies, regardless of the setting in which cramps occurred. Major adverse events (occurring in 2 out of 72 magnesium recipients and 3 out of 68 placebo recipients), and withdrawals due to adverse events, were not significantly different from placebo. However, in the four studies for which it could be determined, more participants experienced minor adverse events in the magnesium group than in the placebo group (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.33; 4 studies, 254 participants; low-certainty evidence). Overall, oral magnesium was associated with mostly gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g. diarrhoea), experienced by 11% (10% in control) to 37% (14% in control) of participants. Authors' conclusions: It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this population is needed.

16,2019,33149925,"Purpose of review: Strategies to mitigate muscle cramps are a top research priority for patients receiving hemodialysis. As hypomagnesemia is a possible risk factor for cramping, we reviewed the literature to better understand the physiology of cramping as well as the epidemiology of hypomagnesemia and muscle cramps. We also sought to review the evidence from interventional studies on the effect of oral and dialysate magnesium-based therapies on muscle cramps. Sources of information: Peer-reviewed articles. Methods: We searched for relevant articles in major bibliographic databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE. The methodological quality of interventional studies was assessed using a modified version of the Downs and Blacks criteria checklist. Key findings: The etiology of muscle cramps in patients receiving hemodialysis is poorly understood and there are no clear evidence-based prevention or treatment strategies. Several factors may play a role including a low concentration of serum magnesium. The prevalence of hypomagnesemia (concentration of 0.7 mmol/L) in patients receiving hemodialysis ranges from 10% to 20%. Causes of hypomagnesemia include a low dietary intake of magnesium, use of medications that inhibit magnesium absorption (eg, proton pump inhibitors), increased magnesium excretion (eg, high-dose loop diuretics), and a low concentration of dialysate magnesium. Dialysate magnesium concentrations of ≤0.5 mmol/L may be associated with a decrease in serum magnesium concentration over time. Preliminary evidence from observational and interventional studies suggests a higher dialysate magnesium concentration will raise serum magnesium concentrations and may reduce the frequency and severity of muscle cramps. However, the quality of evidence supporting this benefit is limited, and larger, multicenter clinical trials are needed to further determine if magnesium-based therapy can reduce muscle cramps in patients receiving hemodialysis. In studies conducted to date, increasing the concentration of dialysate magnesium appears to be well-tolerated and is associated with a low risk of symptomatic hypermagnesemia. Limitations: Few interventional studies have examined the effect of magnesium-based therapy on muscle cramps in patients receiving hemodialysis and most were nonrandomized, pre-post study designs.",Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,0.936501681804657

16,2019,26605029,"The cramp threshold frequency (CTF) is known to be positively correlated with the individual cramp susceptibility. Here we assessed CTF changes after two bouts of electrically induced muscle cramps (EIMCs). The EIMCs (6×5 sec) were unilaterally induced twice (separated by one week) in the gastrocnemius of an intervention group (n=8), while 5 participants served as control. The CTF increased from 25.1±4.6 Hz at baseline to 31.4±9.0 Hz and 31.7±8.5 Hz 24 h after bout 1 and 2 (P 0.05). Thereafter, the CTF declined following both bouts to reach values of 28.0±6.7 Hz and 29.1±7.7 Hz after 72 h after bout 1 and 2. Creatine kinase (CK) activity and perceived discomfort during cramps was lower after bout 2 (P 0.05). CTF, CK, and discomfort did not change in CG. That is, a single bout of EIMCs induces a 24 h CTF increment and a second bout sustains this effect, while perceived discomfort and muscle damage decreases.

The objective of this review is to present updates on the mechanism, investigation and treatment of neurogenic muscle cramps. PubMed and Embase databases were queried between January 1980 and July 2014 for English-language human studies. The American Academy of Neurology classification of studies (classes I-IV) was used to assess levels of evidence. Mechanical disruption, ephaptic transmission, disruption of sensory afferents and persistent inward currents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurogenic cramps. Investigations are directed toward identifying physiological triggers or medical conditions predisposing to cramps. Although cramps can be self-limiting, disabling or sustained muscle cramps should prompt investigation for underlying medical conditions.

16,2019,26069818,"Although the following text will focus on magnesium in disease, its role in healthy subjects during physical exercise when used as a supplement to enhance performance is also noteworthy. Low serum magnesium levels are associated with metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension; consequently, some individuals benefit from magnesium supplementation: increasing magnesium consumption appears to prevent high blood pressure, and higher serum magnesium levels are associated with a lower risk of developing a metabolic syndrome. There are, however, conflicting study results regarding magnesium administration with myocardial infarction with and without reperfusion therapy. There was a long controversy as to whether or not magnesium should be given as a first-line medication. As the most recent trials have not shown any difference in outcome, intravenous magnesium cannot be recommended in patients with myocardial infarction today. However, magnesium has its indication in patients with torsade de pointes and has been given successfully to patients with digoxin-induced arrhythmia or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

Objectives: To assess the effects of lumbar supports for prevention and treatment of non-specific low-back pain. Search strategy: We updated the search in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL to December 2006. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified trials, and contacted experts to identify additional RCTs. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials that reported on any type of lumbar supports as preventive or therapeutic intervention for non-specific low-back pain. Data collection and analysis: One review author generated the electronic search. Two review authors independently identified trials that met the inclusion criteria. One review author extracted data on the study population, interventions, and final results. The methodological quality and the clinical relevance were independently assessed by two review authors. Because it was not possible to perform a quantitative analysis, we performed a qualitative analysis in which the strength of evidence on the effectiveness of lumbar supports was classified as strong, moderate, limited, conflicting, or no evidence. Main results: Seven preventive studies (14,437 people) and eight treatment studies (1361 people) were included in this updated review. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was rather low. Only five of the fifteen studies met 50% or more of the internal validity items. There was moderate evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training in preventing low-back pain, and conflicting evidence whether lumbar supports are effective supplements to other preventive interventions. It is still unclear if lumbar supports are more effective than no or other interventions for the treatment of low-back pain. Authors' conclusions: There is moderate evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training in preventing low-back pain, and conflicting evidence whether they are effective supplements to other preventive interventions. It remains unclear whether lumbar supports are more effective than no or other interventions for treating low-back pain.

17,2019,11295900,"Study design: A review of controlled trials. Objectives: To determine which interventions are used to prevent back and neck pain problems as well as what the evidence is for their utility. Summary of background data: Given the difficulty in successfully treating long-term back and neck pain problems, there has been a call for preventive interventions. Little is known, however, about the value of preventive efforts for nonpatients, e.g., in the general population or workplace. Methods: The literature was systematically searched to locate all investigations that were: 1) specifically designed as a preventive intervention; 2) randomized or nonrandomized controlled trials; and, 3) using subjects not seeking treatment. Outcome was evaluated on the key variables of reported pain, report of injury, dysfunction, time off work, health-care utilization, and cost. Conclusions were drawn using a grading system. Results: Twenty-seven investigations meeting the criteria were found for educational efforts, lumbar supports, exercises, ergonomics, and risk factor modification. For back schools, only one of the nine randomized trials reported a significant effect, and there was strong evidence that back schools are not effective in prevention. Because the randomized trials concerning lumbar supports were consistently negative, there is strong evidence that they are not effective in prevention. Exercises, conversely, showed stable positive results in randomized controlled trials, giving consistent evidence of relatively moderate utility in prevention. Because no properly controlled trials were found for ergonomic interventions or risk factor modification, there was not good quality evidence available to draw a conclusion.

Physicians continue to have difficulty managing this condition despite an increased awareness of its magnitude. In addition, there is a misperception about the outcome of patients affected with low back pain; most continue to suffer from pain. We present a nonoperative approach and review various diagnostic and treatment strategies with respect to both scientific and clinical merit. Although many treatment strategies have not been well proved in the scientific literature, thoughtful review of the available information provides a basis for the use of these treatment methods in the patient with refractory pain.

Secondary analyses from primary preventive studies suggest benefit among workers with previous low back pain, but definitive studies on the effectiveness of supports for the secondary prevention of low back pain are lacking. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of lumbar supports in the secondary prevention of low back pain. Design: Randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Home care organization in the Netherlands. Patients: 360 home care workers with self-reported history of low back pain. Intervention: Short course on healthy working methods, with or without patient-directed use of 1 of 4 types of lumbar support. Measurements: Primary outcomes were the number of days of low back pain and sick leave over 12 months. Secondary outcomes were the average severity of low back pain and function (Quebec Back Pain Disability scale) in the previous week. Results: Over 12 months, participants in the lumbar support group reported an average of -52.7 days (CI, -59.6 to -45.1 days) fewer days with low back pain than participants who received only the short course. However, the total sick days in the lumbar support group did not decrease (-5 days [CI, -21.1 to 6.8 days]). Small but statistically significant differences in pain intensity and function favored lumbar support. Limitations: Study participants were unblinded, and a substantial amount of missing data required imputation. Objective data on sick days due to low back pain were not available. Conclusion: Adding patient-directed use of lumbar supports to a short course on healthy working methods may reduce the number of days when low back pain occurs, but not overall work absenteeism, among home care workers with previous low back pain.

In a secondary preventive RCT, we found beneficial effects and a good adherence among home care workers with low back pain. To target the use of lumbar supports on those patients who can benefit optimally from usage, we need to know why people are adherent. We used the attitude, social support and self-efficacy model to identify determinants for prolonged adherence to wearing a lumbar support. The strongest predictor for intending sustained use of a lumbar support was a positive attitude towards lumbar supports, explaining 41% of the variance (B = 1.31; p 0.001).

17,2019,24999432,"We developed an evidence-based practice guideline to support occupational safety and health (OSH) professionals in assessing the risk due to lifting and in selecting effective preventive measures for low back pain (LBP) in the Netherlands. The guideline was developed at the request of the Dutch government by a project team of experts and OSH professionals in lifting and work-related LBP. The recommendations for risk assessment were based on the quality of instruments to assess the risk on LBP due to lifting. Recommendations for interventions were based on a systematic review of the effects of worker- and work directed interventions to reduce back load due to lifting. The quality of the evidence was rated as strong (A), moderate (B), limited (C) or based on consensus (D). Finally, eight experts and twenty-four OSH professionals commented on and evaluated the content and the feasibility of the preliminary guideline. For risk assessment we recommend loads heavier than 25 kg always to be considered a risk for LBP while loads less than 3 kg do not pose a risk. For loads between 3-25 kg, risk assessment shall be performed using the Manual handling Assessment Charts (MAC)-Tool or National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lifting equation. Effective work oriented interventions are patient lifting devices (Level A) and lifting devices for goods (Level C), optimizing working height (Level A) and reducing load mass (Level C). Ineffective work oriented preventive measures are regulations to ban lifting without proper alternatives (Level D). We do not recommend worker-oriented interventions but consider personal lift assist devices as promising (Level C). Ineffective worker-oriented preventive measures are training in lifting technique (Level A), use of back-belts (Level A) and pre-employment medical examinations (Level A). This multidisciplinary evidence-based practice guideline gives clear criteria whether an employee is at risk for LBP while lifting and provides an easy-reference for (in)effective risk reduction measures based on scientific evidence, experience, and consensus among OSH experts and practitioners.",Can lumbar supports treat or prevent lower back pain?,lumbar supports lower back pain,0.0,Can lumbar supports treat or prevent lower back pain?,0.4732561707496643

18,2019,23740763,"Background: Electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices is used for patients with different types of urinary incontinence and symptoms of urgency, frequency and nocturia. The current review focused on electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices for the treatment of urinary incontinence in men. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices for men with stress, urgency or mixed urinary incontinence in comparison with no treatment, placebo treatment, or any other 'single' treatment. Additionally, the effectiveness of electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices in combination with another intervention was compared with the other intervention alone. Finally, the effectiveness of one method of electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices was compared with another method. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 21 January 2012). We also searched other electronic and non-electronic bibliographic databases and the reference lists of the included studies as well as contacting researchers in the field to identify other relevant trials. Selection criteria: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed all the identified trials for eligibility. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for determining bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, and a third review author was involved in the case of no consensus. Data were analysed using Cochrane methods. Main results: Six randomized controlled trials (five full papers and one abstract) were included. There was considerable variation in the interventions used, study protocols, types of electrical stimulation parameters and devices, study populations and outcome measures. In total 544 men were included, of whom 305 received some form of electrical stimulation, and 239 a control or comparator treatment. The trials were mostly small and generally there was not sufficient information to assess risk of bias; only two trials used secure methods of randomization.There was some evidence that electrical stimulation (ES) had a short-term effect in reducing incontinence compared with sham treatment (for example risk ratio (RR) at six months 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.87) but not at 12 months. Four trials evaluated the effect of adding PFMT to ES versus pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) alone or with biofeedback. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the number of men with urinary incontinence at three months (146/239, 61% for combined treatment versus 98/156, 63% with PFMT alone; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.06). However, there were more adverse effects with combined treatment (23/139, 17% versus 2/99, 2% with PFMT alone; RR 7.04, 95% CI 1.51 to 32.94) and quality of life also seemed better with PFMT alone. One small trial did not detect statistically significant differences between two methods of administration of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (anal versus perineal) but the quality of life score was lower (better) in the anal stimulation group. Authors' conclusions: There was some evidence that electrical stimulation enhanced the effect of PFMT in the short term but not after six months.

Methods: 37 patients (32 females and 5 males) with urinary incontinence were treated with peripheral electrical stimulation. The urodynamic diagnosis were: detrusor instability (24.3%), stress urinary incontinence (24.3%), mixed urinary incontinence (48.6%), and bladder hyper-reflexia (2.7%). Rectal and vaginal electrodes were utilized. The therapeutic frequencies were 10 Hz, 20 Hz and 50 Hz. Results: Detrusor instability disappeared in the cases treated with the 10 Hz frequency (79%) and in one case treated with the 50 Hz frequency. A significantly increased bladder capacity and decreased first micturition sensation were observed in this patient group. All patients with stress urinary incontinence were treated with high frequency (50 Hz), which achieved positive results in 44%. In the group of patients with mixed urinary incontinence. 45% remained unchanged. Treatment failed to achieve satisfactory results in the single case of detrusor hyperreflexia in this series.

Patients with severe pelvic organ prolapse, pregnancy, virgin status, and psychological problems were excluded. The incontinence home-care device treatments were administered in 12-minute sessions, twice daily for 8 weeks. Simultaneously, hyperthermic conditions of 35°C to 40°C and microvibrations were administered. All patients completed urinary incontinence questionnaires (King's Health Questionnaire [KHQ], Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms [BFLUTS] questionnaire, and the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score [OABSS]) before treatment, as well as 4 and 8 weeks into treatment. Changes in the questionnaire responses over time were compared. Two participants dropped out of the study and there was one screening failure, leaving 31 patients for analysis. After 4 weeks treatment, there were significant improvements in symptoms, such as role limitation, physical limitation, social limitation, personal relationship, emotion, sleep/energy, and severity measures. After 8 weeks treatment, almost all parameters on the KHQ revealed symptomatic improvement. On the BFLUTS, voiding times during activity, nocturia, urgency, urge incontinence, incontinence frequency, stress incontinence, volume leakage, strain to start, intermittency, reduced stream, acute retention, incomplete emptying, and stopping flow showed significant improvements. On the OABSS, almost all storage symptoms improved.

18,2019,29271482,"Background: Several treatment options are available for stress urinary incontinence (SUI), including pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), drug therapy and surgery. Problems exist such as adherence to PFMT regimens, side effects linked to drug therapy and the risks associated with surgery. We have evaluated an alternative treatment, electrical stimulation (ES) with non-implanted devices, which aims to improve pelvic floor muscle function to reduce involuntary urine loss. Objectives: To assess the effects of electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices, alone or in combination with other treatment, for managing stress urinary incontinence or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence in women. Among the outcomes examined were costs and cost-effectiveness. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearches of journals and conference proceedings (searched 27 February 2017). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and undertook separate searches to identify studies examining economic data. Selection criteria: We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of ES with non-implanted devices compared with any other treatment for SUI in women. Eligible trials included adult women with SUI or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence (MUI). We excluded studies of women with urgency-predominant MUI, urgency urinary incontinence only, or incontinence associated with a neurologic condition. We would have included economic evaluations had they been conducted alongside eligible trials. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data from eligible trials and assessed risk of bias, using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We would have performed economic evaluations using the approach recommended by Cochrane Economic Methods. Main results: We identified 56 eligible trials (3781 randomised participants). Eighteen trials did not report the primary outcomes of subjective cure, improvement of SUI or incontinence-specific quality of life (QoL). The risk of bias was generally unclear, as most trials provided little detail when reporting their methods. We assessed 25% of the included trials as being at high risk of bias for a variety of reasons, including industry funding and baseline differences between groups. We did not identify any economic evaluations.For subjective cure of SUI, we found moderate-quality evidence that ES is probably better than no active treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.31, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.02). We found a similar result for cure or improvement of SUI (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.11), but the quality of evidence was lower. We are very uncertain if there is a difference between ES and sham treatment in terms of subjective cure because of the very low quality of evidence (RR 2.21, 95% CI 0.38 to 12.73). For subjective cure or improvement, ES may be better than sham treatment (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.02 to 4.07). The effect estimate was 660/1000 women cured/improved with ES compared to 382/1000 with no active treatment (95% CI 538 to 805 women); and for sham treatment, 402/1000 women cured/improved with ES compared to 198/1000 with sham treatment (95% CI 202 to 805 women).Low-quality evidence suggests that there may be no difference in cure or improvement for ES versus PFMT (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.03), PFMT plus ES versus PFMT alone (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.28) or ES versus vaginal cones (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.21).Electrical stimulation probably improves incontinence-specific QoL compared to no treatment (moderate quality evidence) but there may be little or no difference between electrical stimulation and PFMT (low quality evidence). It is uncertain whether adding electrical stimulation to PFMT makes any difference in terms of quality of life, compared with PFMT alone (very low quality evidence). There may be little or no difference between electrical stimulation and vaginal cones in improving incontinence-specific QoL (low quality evidence). The impact of electrical stimulation on subjective cure/improvement and incontinence-specific QoL, compared with vaginal cones, PFMT plus vaginal cones, or drugs therapy, is uncertain (very low quality evidence).In terms of subjective cure/improvement and incontinence-specific QoL, the available evidence comparing ES versus drug therapy or PFMT plus vaginal cones was very low quality and inconclusive. Similarly, comparisons of different types of ES to each other and of ES plus surgery to surgery are also inconclusive in terms of subjective cure/improvement and incontinence-specific QoL (very low-quality evidence).Adverse effects were rare: in total nine of the women treated with ES in the trials reported an adverse effect. We identified insufficient evidence to compare the risk of adverse effects in women treated with ES compared to any other treatment. We were unable to identify any economic data. Authors' conclusions: The current evidence base indicated that electrical stimulation is probably more effective than no active or sham treatment, but it is not possible to say whether ES is similar to PFMT or other active treatments in effectiveness or not. Overall, the quality of the evidence was too low to provide reliable results. Without sufficiently powered trials measuring clinically important outcomes, such as subjective assessment of urinary incontinence, we cannot draw robust conclusions about the overall effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of electrical stimulation for stress urinary incontinence in women.",Can electrical stimulation devices treat male urinary incontinence?,electrical stimulation male urinary incontinence,0.0,Can electrical stimulation devices treat male urinary incontinence?,0.18718719482421875

It includes several techniques that can be used to improve stress, urge, and mixed symptoms. However, the magnitude of the alleged benefits is not completely established. Objectives: To determine the effects of electrical stimulation in women with symptoms or urodynamic diagnoses of stress, urge, and mixed incontinence. Search strategy: Our review included articles published between January 1980 and January 2012. We used the search terms ″urinary incontinence″, ″electrical stimulation ″, ″ intravaginal ″, ″ tibial nerve ″ and ″ neuromodulation ″ for studies including female patients. Selection criteria: We evaluated randomized trials that included electrical stimulation in at least one arm of the trial, to treat women with urinary incontinence. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed the data from the trials, for inclusion or exclusion, and methodological analysis. Main results: A total of 30 randomized clinical trials were included. Most of the trials involved intravaginal electrical stimulation. Intravaginal electrical stimulation showed effectiveness in treating urge urinary incontinence, but reported contradictory data regarding stress and mixed incontinence. Tibial-nerve stimulation showed promising results in randomized trials with a short follow-up period. Sacral-nerve stimulation yielded interesting results in refractory patients. Conclusions: Tibial-nerve and intravaginal stimulation have shown effectiveness in treating urge urinary incontinence. Sacral-nerve stimulation provided benefits in refractory cases. Presently available data provide no support for the use of intravaginal electrical stimulation to treat stress urinary incontinence in women.

19,2019,32929686,"Cough is a widespread symptom in children and adolescents. Despite advances in scientific knowledge about the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the cough reflex, the best therapeutic approaches for children and adolescents who cough remain unclear, and many needs are still unmet. Many remedies for cough are self-prescribed, reflecting strong demand, but significant evidence of their efficacy and safety is missing in pediatric populations. Moreover, as most coughs are part of self-limited illnesses, treatment could be considered unnecessary in some patients. Drug therapy to relieve cough and other symptoms is an essential part of treating a child with cough. However, unfortunately, the number of studies in each category of cough medications is minimal, and dosing and treatment duration varies significantly among studies. Some treatments have been shown to be no more effective than placebo. Lack of clear indications for dosing and treatment duration, the number of available drugs, the numerous active ingredients in products, and multiple caregivers administering medication to children have been considered contributors to an increased risk of inappropriate prescribing, accidental overdosing, and adverse events. This review presents the most recent evidence on the safety and efficacy of available cough remedies, focusing on the pediatric age group, and includes H 1 receptor antagonists, mucolytics and expectorants, drugs acting peripherally on the cough reflex, drugs acting centrally on the cough reflex, drugs acting both peripherally and centrally on the cough reflex, and other compounds, including menthol, glycerol, honey, and medical devices composed of complex natural substances.

19,2019,25642485,"Question Cough is a very common presentation among sick children in my clinic. There is almost no day without a child being examined for upper respiratory tract infection and cough. While I understand that no medications are recommended for relief of cough—prescribed or over the counter—is it true that honey might help relieve cough symptoms in children? Answer Most prescribed and over-the-counter preparations for cough in children are not effective and might carry the risk of adverse events. A single dose of honey before bedtime was shown in recent studies to diminish cough and the discomfort experienced by children and their parents. Recent evidence also supports administering a few daily doses, but this practice will need further study to assess its effectiveness and safety.",Can honey offer relief from cough symptoms in children?,honey children cough,1.0,Can honey offer relief from cough symptoms in children?,0.8352757096290588
19,2019,25536086,"Background: Cough causes concern for parents and is a major cause of outpatient visits. It can impact on quality of life, cause anxiety and affect sleep in parents and children. Several remedies, including honey, have been used to alleviate cough symptoms. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of honey for acute cough in children in ambulatory settings. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1950 to October week 4, 2014), EMBASE (1990 to November 2014), CINAHL (1981 to November 2014), Web of Science (2000 to November 2014), AMED (1985 to November 2014), LILACS (1982 to November 2014) and CAB abstracts (2009 to January 2014). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing honey given alone, or in combination with antibiotics, versus nothing, placebo or other over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications to participants aged from one to 18 years for acute cough in ambulatory settings. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened search results for eligible studies and extracted data on reported outcomes. Main results: We included three RCTs, two at high risk of bias and one at low risk of bias, involving 568 children. The studies compared honey with dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, 'no treatment' and placebo for the effect on symptomatic relief of cough using a seven-point Likert scale. The lower the score, the better the cough symptom being assessed.Moderate quality evidence showed that honey may be better than 'no treatment' in reducing the frequency of cough (mean difference (MD) -1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.48 to -0.62; I(2) statistic 23%; two studies, 154 participants). High quality evidence also suggests that honey may be better than placebo for reduction of cough frequency (MD -1.85; 95% Cl -3.36 to -0.33; one study, 300 participants). Moderate quality evidence suggests that honey does not differ significantly from dextromethorphan in reducing cough frequency (MD -0.07; 95% CI -1.07 to 0.94; two studies, 149 participants). Low quality evidence suggests that honey may be slightly better than diphenhydramine in reducing cough frequency (MD -0.57; 95% CI -0.90 to -0.24; one study, 80 participants).Adverse events included mild reactions (nervousness, insomnia and hyperactivity) experienced by seven children (9.3%) from the honey group and two (2.7%) from the dextromethorphan group; the difference was not significant (risk ratio (RR) 2.94; 95% Cl 0.74 to 11.71; two studies, 149 participants). Three children (7.5%) in the diphenhydramine group experienced somnolence (RR 0.14; 95% Cl 0.01 to 2.68; one study, 80 participants). When honey was compared with placebo, four children (1.8%) in the honey group and one (1.3%) from the placebo group complained of gastrointestinal symptoms (RR 1.33; 95% Cl 0.15 to 11.74). However, there was no significant difference between honey versus dextromethorphan, honey versus diphenhydramine or honey versus placebo. No adverse event was reported in the 'no treatment' group. Authors' conclusions: Honey may be better than 'no treatment', diphenhydramine and placebo for the symptomatic relief of cough, but it is not better than dextromethorphan.

Current studies show a lack of proven efficacy for over-the counter (OTC) medications, but promising data support the use of honey for children. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two kinds of Iranian honey with diphenhydramine (DPH) on nocturnal pediatric coughs and the sleep quality of children and their parents. This was a clinical trial (registered in IRCT; No.: 28.20.7932, 15 October 2013). The study consisted of 87 patients. All the parents completed a standard previously validated questionnaire. The children were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: Group 1, Honey type 1 (Kimia Company, Iran) (n = 42), Group 2, Honey type 2 (Shahde-Golha, Iran) (n = 25), and Group 3, DPH (n = 20). Each group received double doses of the respective treatments on two successive nights. A second survey was then administered via a telephone interview in which the parents were asked the same questions. The mean scores for all aspects of coughs were significantly decreased in each group before and after the treatment. All three treatments improved the cough and sleep scores. Honey type 1 was superior to DPH in improving all aspects of coughs, except the frequency, and Honey type 2 was more effective than DPH in improving all aspects of coughs, except the sleep quality of the child. There was no significant difference between Honey type 1 and 2 in any aspects of cough relief in the present study.

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of exogenous steroids on the outcome of experimental spinal cord injury and the effect of experimental spinal cord injury on endogenous cortisol production. Thirty female rhesus monkeys received a 660 gm cm lesion to the T10 spinal cord. They were randomly placed into one of six groups of five animals each. Two groups were controls used to assess the endogenous cortisol response to spinal cord injury. These animals received no steroids. The other four groups received one of two commonly used steroid preparations. All animals were evaluated serially for neurological status using motor testing and for general physical status. Serial cortisol determinations were obtained for an eight-week post injury period. The steroid groups showed some benefit from treatment when compared to the untreated controls. There were no significant differences in physical condition between treated and control groups. Of special interest was the response of endogenous cortisol production to spinal cord injury.

In this review, we examined the relative risk/benefit ratio of intravenously treating spinal gunshot wound victims with steroids. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of 254 consecutive patients who were treated between 1979 and 1994 for gunshot wounds to the spine (C1-L1) and a spinal cord injury. Three subgroups were established based on the administration of the steroids methylprednisolone (National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study 2 protocol), dexamethasone (initial dose, 10-100 mg), and no steroids. All patients who received steroids were initially treated at another hospital and then transferred. No patients received steroids at our institution. The data analyzed included neurological outcome and infectious and noninfectious complications. Results: No statistically significant neurological benefits were demonstrable from the use of steroids (methylprednisolone, dexamethasone). Infectious complications were increased in both groups receiving steroids (not statistically significant). Gastrointestinal complications were significantly increased in the dexamethasone group (P = 0.021), and pancreatitis was significantly increased in the methylprednisolone group (P = 0.040). The mean duration of follow-up was 56.3 months. Conclusion: In this retrospective, nonrandomized review, no neurological benefits were detectable from intravenously administered steroids after a gunshot wound to the spine. Both infectious and noninfectious complication rates were higher in the groups receiving steroids. Patients who sustain a spinal cord injury secondary to a gunshot wound to the spine should not be treated with steroids until the efficacy of such treatment is proven in a controlled study.",Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,0.5874660611152649
20,2019,22302639,"OPINION STATEMENT: Most treatment options for acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) are directed at minimizing progression of the initial injury and preventing secondary injury. Failure to adhere to certain guiding principles can be detrimental to the long-term neurologic and functional outcome of these patients. Therapy for the hyperacute phase of traumatic SCI focuses on stabilizing vital signs and follows the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) algorithm for ensuring stability of airway, breathing and circulation, and disability (neurologic evaluation)-with spinal stabilization-and exposure. Spinal stabilization, with cervical collars and long backboards, is used to prevent movement of a potentially unstable spinal column injury to prevent further injury to the spinal cord and nerve roots, especially during prehospital transport. Surgery to stabilize the spine is undertaken after life-threatening injuries (hemorrhage, evacuation of intracranial hemorrhage, acute vascular compromise) are addressed. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission is to be considered for all patients with high SCI or hemodynamic instability, as well as those with other injuries that independently warrant ICU admission. Avoidance of hypotension and hypoxia may minimize secondary neurologic injury. Elevating the mean arterial pressure above 85 mmHg for 7 days should be considered, to allow for spinal cord perfusion. The use of intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone) is controversial. Early tracheostomy in patients with lesions above C5 may reduce the number of ventilator days and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Select patients may benefit from the placement of a diaphragmatic pacer. Aggressive measures, including CoughAssist and Intermittent Positive Pressure Breaths (IPPB), should be used to maintain lung recruitment and aid in the mobilization of secretions. Some patients with high SCI who are dependent on mechanical ventilation can eventually be liberated from the ventilator with consistent efforts from both the patient and the caregiver, along with some patience. Intermittent catheterization by the patient or a caregiver may be associated with a lower incidence of urinary tract infections, compared with an in-dwelling urinary catheter. Early mobilization of patients and a multidisciplinary approach (including respiratory therapists, nutritional experts, physical therapists, and occupational therapists) can streamline care and may improve long-term outcomes. A number of investigational drugs and therapies offer hope of neurologic recovery for some patients.",Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,0.8949964046478271
20,2019,11805608,"Study design: Literature review. Objectives: The purpose of this article is to review the available literature and formulate evidence-based recommendations for the use of methylprednisone in the setting of acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Summary of background data: Since the early 1990s, methylprednisolone has become widely prescribed for the treatment of acute SCI. Arguably, it has become a standard of care. Methods: Through an electronic database search strategy and by cross-reference with published literature, appropriate clinical studies were identified. They were reviewed in chronologic order with respect to study design, outcome measures, results, and conclusions. Results: Nine studies were identified that attempted to evaluate the role of steroids in nonpenetrating (blunt) spinal cord injury. Five of these were Class I clinical trials, and four were Class II studies. All of the studies failed to demonstrate improvement because of steroid administration in any of the a priori hypotheses testing. Although post hoc analyses were interesting, they failed to demonstrate consistent significant treatment effects. Conclusions: From an evidence-based approach, methylprednisolone cannot be recommended for routine use in acute nonpenetrating SCI. Prolonged administration of high-dose steroids (48 hours) may be harmful to the patient. Until more evidence is forthcoming, methylprednisolone should be considered to have investigational (unproven) status only.",Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,0.37693658471107483
20,2019,33684579,"Background: Acute spinal cord injury (ASCI) is a devastating event that can have a profound impact on the lives of patients and their families. While no definitive medical treatment exists, the role of methylprednisolone (MP) in the management of ASCI and other spinal cord pathologies has been investigated in depth; however, its use remains contentious. While MP initially showed promise in the efficacy of ASCI treatment, more recent studies have questioned its use citing numerous systemic adverse effects. Pharmacologic treatments in this area are poorly understood due to the scarcity of knowledge surrounding the pathophysiology and heterogeneity of patients presenting with these conditions. Despite these shortcomings and due to the lack of alternative treatment options, MP is still widely used by physicians. Methods: We review prior and current literature on the use of MP treatment for ASCI patients with a discussion of novel drug delivery systems that have demonstrated the potential to improve MP's bioavailability at the site of injury while minimizing systemic side effects. In addition, current views on the role of MP and dexamethasone in metastatic spinal cord compression and postoperative infection are reviewed. Results: While some data support benefits in the use of steroids on spinal cord pathology, extensive research suggests at best limited effects and an unresolvable risk/benefit problem. Conclusions: At present, evidence regarding use of dexamethasone for MSCC is contentious, especially regarding dose regiments. Ultimately, further investigation into the use of steroids is required to determine its utility in treating patients with spinal cord pathology.",Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,0.8484921455383301
20,2019,22258943,"Background: Acute spinal cord injury is a devastating condition typically affecting young people, mostly males. Steroid treatment in the early hours after the injury is aimed at reducing the extent of permanent paralysis during the rest of the patient's life. Objectives: To review randomized trials of steroids for human acute spinal cord injury. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (searched 02 Aug 2011), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 2011, issue 3 (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (Ovid) 1948 to July Week 3 2011, EMBASE (Ovid) 1974 to 2011 week 17, ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) 1970 to Aug 2011, ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (CPCI-S) 1990 to Aug 2011 and PubMed [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/] (searched 04 Aug 2011) for records added to PubMed in the last 90 days). Files of the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) were reviewed (NASCIS was founded in 1977 and has tracked trials in this area since that date). We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and previously published reviews. Selection criteria: All randomized controlled trials of steroid treatment for acute spinal cord injury in any language. Data collection and analysis: One review author extracted data from trial reports. Japanese and French studies were found through NASCIS and additional data (e.g. SDs) were obtained from the original study authors. Main results: Eight trials are included in this review, seven used methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate has been shown to improve neurologic outcome up to one year post-injury if administered within eight hours of injury and in a dose regimen of: bolus 30mg/kg over 15 minutes, with maintenance infusion of 5.4 mg/kg per hour infused for 23 hours. The initial North American trial results were replicated in a Japanese trial but not in the one from France. Data was obtained from the latter studies to permit appropriate meta-analysis of all three trials. This indicated significant recovery in motor function after methylprednisolone therapy, when administration commenced within eight hours of injury. A more recent trial indicates that, if methylprednisolone therapy is given for an additional 24 hours (a total of 48 hours), additional improvement in motor neurologic function and functional status are observed. This is particularly observed if treatment cannot be started until between three to eight hours after injury. The same methylprednisolone therapy has been found effective in whiplash injuries. A modified regimen was found to improve recovery after surgery for lumbar disc disease. The risk of bias was low in the largest methyprednisolne trials. Overall, there was no evidence of significantly increased complications or mortality from the 23 or 48 hour therapy. Authors' conclusions: High-dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy is the only pharmacologic therapy shown to have efficacy in a phase three randomized trial when administered within eight hours of injury. One trial indicates additional benefit by extending the maintenance dose from 24 to 48 hours, if start of treatment must be delayed to between three and eight hours after injury.

The authors were advised to follow the rules of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE®) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence. The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasised.

Randomized controlled trials support the efficacy of selective serotonin and selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs, respectively), as well as benzodiazepines, azapirones, anti-adrenergic medications, melatonin analogs, second-generation antipsychotics, kava, and lavender oil in GAD. However, psychopharmacologic treatment selection requires clinicians to consider multiple factors, including age, co-morbidity, and prior treatment. Areas covered: The authors review the literature concerning pharmacotherapy for pediatric and adult patients with GAD with specific commentary on the efficacy and tolerability of selected agents in these age groups. The authors describe an algorithmic approach to the pediatric and adult patient with GAD and highlight considerations for the use of selected medications in these patients. Expert opinion: In adults with GAD, SSRIs and SNRIs represent the first-line psychopharmacologic treatment while second-line pharmacotherapies include buspirone, benzodiazepines, SGAs, and pregabalin.

22,2019,12444816,"Background: The prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) represents an important public health issue. Hydroxyzine, an antagonist of histamine receptors, showed both efficacy and safety in previous short-term double-blind studies over placebo in this pathology. The aim of the current study was to confirm those positive results over a 3-month period in adult outpatients. Method: This multicenter, parallel (hydroxyzine [50 mg/day]; bromazepam [6 mg/day]), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 2 weeks of single-blind run-in placebo, 12 weeks of double-blind randomized treatment, and 4 weeks of single-blind run-out placebo. Three hundred thirty-four of 369 selected outpatients with a diagnosis of GAD according to DSM-IV criteria and a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score &gt;/= 20 were randomized before entering the double-blind period. The primary outcome criterion was the change in the HAM-A score from baseline to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with hydroxyzine compared with placebo. Results: In the intent-to-treat analysis, the mean +/- SD change in HAM-A scores from baseline to endpoint was -12.16 +/- 7.74 for hydroxyzine and -9.64 +/- 7.74 for placebo (p =.019). Results at endpoint for percentage of responders (p =.003) and remission rates (p =.028), Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale score (p =.001), maintenance of efficacy (p =.022), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale score on day 84 (p =.008) also confirmed the efficacy of hydroxyzine over placebo. The study showed no statistically significant difference between hydroxyzine and bromazepam. Except for drowsiness, which was more frequent with bromazepam, safety results were comparable in the 3 groups.

22,2019,21154375,"Background: Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common chronic long-term psychiatric disorder, particularly frequent in primary care. There are several treatment options available, both non-pharmacological (i.e. cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological. Among the pharmacological interventions, antidepressants, buspirone and benzodiazepines (BDZs) have been studied in GAD. Hydroxyzine is an anti-histamine medication which has been used in the treatment of anxiety. Objectives: 1. To determine the efficacy of hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent in alleviating the acute symptoms of GAD. 2. To review acceptability of treatment with hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent. 3. To investigate the adverse effects of hydroxyzine in comparison with other active agents. Search strategy: The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched on 1 March 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO and checked reference lists of included studies, previous systematic reviews and major textbooks of anxiety disorders. Personal communication with pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field was also undertaken. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with GAD to hydroxyzine versus placebo and/or any other anxiolytic agent. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (such as the number of patients who responded to treatment or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side effect profile). Main results: The search yielded 39 studies. We included five studies in the review with a total of 884 participants. We excluded 31 studies and designated three as awaiting assessment. The data from the included studies provide some evidence that hydroxyzine is more effective than placebo for GAD (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58) and that it is also acceptable/tolerable (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.58) (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.40). Compared to other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability (hydroxyzine vs chloridiazepoxide: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.62; hydroxyzine vs buspirone efficacy OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.42). In terms of side effects, hydroxyzine was associated with a higher rate of sleepiness/drowsiness than the active comparators (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.53). There was, however, a high risk of bias in the included studies. Authors' conclusions: The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol for this review. Even though more effective than placebo, due to the high risk of bias of the included studies, the small number of studies and the overall small sample size, it is not possible to recommend hydroxyzine as a reliable first-line treatment in GAD.",How effective is hydroxyzine (also known as Atarax) for treating generalized anxiety disorder?,hydroxyzine generalized anxiety disorder,0.0,How effective is hydroxyzine (also known as Atarax) for treating generalized anxiety disorder?,0.7084817290306091

27,2019,26757284,"Background: Systematic reviews were conducted to examine two related key questions (KQs) in children with chronic (&gt; 4 weeks' duration) wet or productive cough not related to bronchiectasis: KQ1-How effective are antibiotics in improving the resolution of cough? If so, what antibiotic should be used and for how long? KQ2-When should they be referred for further investigations? Methods: The systematic reviews were undertaken based on the protocol established by selected members of the CHEST expert cough panel. Two authors screened searches and selected and extracted data. The study included systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort (prospective and retrospective) studies, and cross-sectional studies published in English. Results: Data were presented in Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flowcharts, and the summaries were tabulated. Fifteen studies were included in KQ1 (three systematic reviews, three RCTs, five prospective studies, and four retrospective studies) and 17 in KQ2 (one RCT, 11 prospective studies, and five retrospective studies). Combining data from the RCTs (KQ1), the number needed to treat for benefit was 3 (95% CI, 2.0-4.3) in achieving cough resolution. In general, findings from prospective and retrospective studies were consistent, but there were minor variations. Conclusions: There is high-quality evidence that in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (&gt; 4 weeks' duration) wet or productive cough, the use of appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution. There is also high-quality evidence that when specific cough pointers (eg, digital clubbing) are present in children with wet cough, further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be conducted.

27,2019,28143696,"Background: Wet or productive cough is common in children with chronic cough. We formulated recommendations based on systematic reviews related to the management of chronic wet cough in children (aged ≤ 14 years) based on two key questions: (1) how effective are antibiotics in improving the resolution of cough? If so, what antibiotic should be used and for how long? and (2) when should children be referred for further investigations? Methods: We used the CHEST expert cough panel's protocol for systematic reviews and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and GRADE framework (the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus for the recommendations/suggestions made. Results: Combining data from the systematic reviews, we found high-quality evidence in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (&gt; 4 weeks' duration) wet/productive cough that using appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution, and further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be undertaken when specific cough pointers (eg, digital clubbing) are present. When the wet cough does not improve following 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, there is moderate-quality evidence that further investigations should be considered to look for an underlying disease. New recommendations include the recognition of the clinical diagnostic entity of protracted bacterial bronchitis.

27,2019,30062732,"Background: Cough is a frequent symptom presenting to doctors. The most common cause of childhood chronic (greater than fours weeks' duration) wet cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in some settings, although other more serious causes can also present this way. Timely and effective management of chronic wet or productive cough improves quality of life and clinical outcomes. Current international guidelines suggest a course of antibiotics is the first treatment of choice in the absence of signs or symptoms specific to an alternative diagnosis. This review sought to clarify the current evidence to support this recommendation. Objectives: To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with prolonged wet cough (excluding children with bronchiectasis or other known underlying respiratory illness) and to assess risk of harm due to adverse events. Search methods: We undertook an updated search (from 2008 onwards) using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, trials registries, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest searches were performed in September 2017. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic wet cough. We excluded cluster and cross-over trials. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane. We reviewed results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two independent review authors selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors of eligible studies for further information as needed. We analysed data as 'intention to treat.' Main results: We identified three studies as eligible for inclusion in the review. Two were in the previous review and one new study was included. We considered the older studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias whereas we judged the newly included study at low risk of bias. The studies varied in treatment duration (from 7 to 14 days) and the antibiotic used (two studies used amoxicillin/clavulanate acid and one used erythromycin).We included 190 children (171 completed), mean ages ranged from 21 months to six years, in the meta-analyses. Analysis of all three trials (190 children) found that treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31, using intention-to -treat analysis), which translated to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). We identified no significant heterogeneity (for both fixed-effect and random-effects model the I² statistic was 0%). Two older trials assessed progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics (125 children), which was significantly lower in the antibiotic group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.34; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). All three trials (190 children) reported adverse events, which were not significantly increased in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.69). We assessed the quality of evidence GRADE rating as moderate for all outcome measures, except adverse events which we assessed as low quality. Authors' conclusions: Evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious for the treatment of children with chronic wet cough (greater than four weeks) with an NNTB of three. However, antibiotics have adverse effects and this review reported only uncertainty as to the risk of increased adverse effects when they were used in this setting. The inclusion of a more robust study strengthened the previous Cochrane review and its results.",Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,0.1814935803413391
27,2019,29387250,"Chronic cough in childhood is associated with a high morbidity and decreased quality of life. Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) seems to be the second most common cause of chronic cough in children under 6 years of age. Its main clinical feature is represented by wet cough that worsens when changing posture and improves after the introduction of antibiotics. Currently, the mainstay of PBB treatment is a 2-week therapy with a high dose of antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav, to eradicate the infection and restore epithelial integrity. It is very important to contemplate this disease in a child with chronic cough since the misdiagnosis of PBB could lead to complications such as bronchiectasis. Clinicians, however, often do not consider this disease in the differential diagnosis and, consequently, they are inclined to change the antibiotic therapy rather than to extend it or to add steroids.

27,2019,31956642,"The causes of chronic cough in children are mainly dependent on the setting and age of the child. Protracted bacterial bronchitis is a frequent cause of morbidity in childhood, and antibiotic treatment is beneficial. Prompt recognition and early treatment is important both to prevent inappropriate use of asthma medications and also progression to bronchiectasis, but the diagnosis should not be made uncritically, because chronic wet cough is not necessarily due to lower airway disease. Upper Airway Cough Syndrome (UACS) is considered by some to cause chronic cough in childhood. Underlying UACS are many common conditions, including allergic rhinitis, adenoiditis and rhinosinusitis. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical criteria that are relatively sensitive but non-specific. The role of nasal endoscopy in children with chronic cough and signs suggesting UACS is unclear. Nasal saline solution irrigation is commonly used in UACS, but most studies have methodological biases, and efficacy data are scanty. Randomized controlled trials are urgently required. However, if saline washes, rather than oral antibiotics, can effectively treat some children with wet cough associated with upper airway conditions, antibiotic resistance could potentially be reduced. There is a need to further study wet cough and not to assume it to be equivalent to lower airway infection in all children.",Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,0.3243405222892761
27,2019,31515408,"These guidelines incorporate the recent advances in chronic cough pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. The concept of cough hypersensitivity has allowed an umbrella term that explains the exquisite sensitivity of patients to external stimuli such a cold air, perfumes, smoke and bleach. Thus, adults with chronic cough now have a firm physical explanation for their symptoms based on vagal afferent hypersensitivity. Different treatable traits exist with cough variant asthma (CVA)/eosinophilic bronchitis responding to anti-inflammatory treatment and non-acid reflux being treated with promotility agents rather the anti-acid drugs. An alternative antitussive strategy is to reduce hypersensitivity by neuromodulation. Low-dose morphine is highly effective in a subset of patients with cough resistant to other treatments. Gabapentin and pregabalin are also advocated, but in clinical experience they are limited by adverse events. Perhaps the most promising future developments in pharmacotherapy are drugs which tackle neuronal hypersensitivity by blocking excitability of afferent nerves by inhibiting targets such as the ATP receptor (P2X3). Finally, cough suppression therapy when performed by competent practitioners can be highly effective. Children are not small adults and a pursuit of an underlying cause for cough is advocated. Thus, in toddlers, inhalation of a foreign body is common. Persistent bacterial bronchitis is a common and previously unrecognised cause of wet cough in children.

27,2019,22628120,"Background: Despite guideline recommendations, there are no published randomised controlled trial data on the efficacy of antibiotics for chronic wet cough in children. The majority of children with chronic wet cough have protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), a recognised condition in multiple national guidelines. The authors conducted a parallel 1:1 placebo randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that a 2-week course of amoxycillin clavulanate is efficacious in the treatment of children with chronic wet cough. Methods: 50 children (median age 1.9 years, IQR 0.9-5.1) with chronic (&gt;3 weeks) wet cough were randomised to 2 weeks of twice daily oral amoxycillin clavulanate (22.5 mg/kg/dose) or placebo. The primary outcome was 'cough resolution' defined as a &gt;75% reduction in the validated verbal category descriptive cough score within 14 days of treatment compared with baseline scores, or cessation of cough for &gt;3 days. In selected children, flexible bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were undertaken at baseline. Results: Cough resolution rates (48%) were significantly higher in children who received amoxycillin clavulanate compared with those who received placebo (16%), p=0.016. The observed difference between proportions was 0.32 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.56). Post treatment, median verbal category descriptive score in the amoxycillin clavulanate group of 0.5 (IQR 0.0-2.0) was significantly lower than in the placebo group, 2.25 (IQR 1.15-2.9) (p=0.02). Pre-treatment BAL data were consistent with PBB in the majority of children, with no significant difference between groups. Conclusion: A 2-week course of amoxycillin clavulanate will achieve cough resolution in a significant number of children with chronic wet cough.

Data collection and analysis: At least three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial. Main results: Twelve trials with 1,720 participants met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials investigated treatment regimens and two investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. Results showed that short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three days, clarithromycin for seven days, or erythromycin estolate for seven days) were equally effective with long-term antibiotic treatment (erythromycin estolate or erythromycin for 14 days) in the microbiological eradication of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx. The relative risk (RR) was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05). Side effects were fewer with short-term treatment (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). There were no differences in clinical improvement or microbiological relapse between short and long-term treatment regimens. Contact prophylaxis (of contacts older than six months of age) with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases that developed culture positive B. pertussis. Authors' conclusions: Antibiotics are effective in eliminating B. pertussis from patients with the disease, rendering them non-infectious, but do not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. Effective regimens include: three days of azithromycin, seven days of clarithromycin, seven or 14 days of erythromycin estolate, and 14 days of erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Considering microbiological clearance and side effects, three days of azithromycin or seven days of clarithromycin are the best regimens. Seven days of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole also appeared to be effective for the eradication of B. pertussis from the nasopharynx and may serve as an alternative antibiotic treatment for patients who cannot tolerate a macrolide.

28,2019,30710647,"Background and objective: Macrolides are the recommended antibiotics for treating pertussis and preventing transmission. The causative bacterium, Bordetella pertussis, has high macrolide resistance and has recently circulated in China. The objective of this study was to find effective alternative antibiotics for treatment by assessing the in vitro activity and clinical efficacy of antibiotics against Bordetella pertussis. Methods: Bordetella pertussis was confirmed by agglutination with specific antisera and mass spectrometry. The MICs of antibiotics against isolates were determined using the Etest method. Treatment outcomes were clinically and microbiologically evaluated. Results: A total of 126 pertussis patients were diagnosed based on culture, 69.8% of whom were aged ≤6 months and 72.1% were treated with previous macrolides. Leucocytosis and lymphocytosis were observed in 29.4% and 54.8% of all patients, respectively. Both MIC 50 and MIC 90 of erythromycin, azithromycin, and clindamycin were &gt;256mg/L, and 75.4% were highly macrolide resistant. The MIC 90 of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and cefoperazone-sulbactam were 0.38mg/L, 0.25mg/L, 0.19mg/L, 12mg/L, 0.19mg/L and 0.047mg/L, respectively. The MICs of piperacillin in all of the isolations were 0.016mg/L. Of the patients treated with single cefoperazone-sulbactam or piperacillin-tazobactam, 30 of 32 (93.8%) had significantly improved clinical symptoms and 24 of 25 (96%) had negative culture results after 2 weeks of therapy. Conclusion: Macrolide resistance in Bordetella pertussis is a serious problem in Zhejiang Province, China. Piperacillin/piperacillin-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam have potent antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo, and may become the alternative choice for treating pertussis caused by macrolide-resistant isolates.",Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for whooping cough (pertussis)?,antibiotics whooping cough,1.0,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for whooping cough (pertussis)?,0.30852919816970825
28,2019,30321509,"Background: The decision to treat a suspected case of pertussis with antibiotics is usually based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation. The current guideline focuses on making the clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough in adults and children. Methods: The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework were used. The Expert Cough Panel based their recommendations on findings from a systematic review that was recently published on the topic; final grading was reached by consensus according to Delphi methodology. The systematic review was carried out to answer the Key Clinical Question: In patients presenting with cough, how can we most accurately diagnose from clinical features alone those who have pertussis-associated cough as opposed to other causes of cough? Results: In adults, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 4 clinical features: paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever. Both paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity (93.2% [95% CI, 83.2-97.4] and 81.8% [95% CI, 72.2-88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [95% CI, 14.7-28.1] and 18.8% [95% CI, 8.1-37.9]). Inspiratory whooping and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity (32.5% [95% CI, 24.5-41.6] and 29.8% [95% CI, 18.0-45.2]) but high specificity (77.7% [95% CI, 73.1-81.7] and 79.5% [95% CI, 69.4-86.9]). In children, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 1 clinical feature in children (0-18 years): posttussive vomiting. Posttussive vomiting in children was only moderately sensitive (60.0% [95% CI, 40.3-77.0]) and specific (66.0% [95% CI, 52.5-77.3]). Conclusions: In adults with acute ( 3 weeks) or subacute (3-8 weeks) cough, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children with acute ( 4 weeks) cough, posttussive vomiting is suggestive of pertussis but is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test. Guideline suggestions are made based upon these findings and conclusions.",Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for whooping cough (pertussis)?,antibiotics whooping cough,1.0,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for whooping cough (pertussis)?,0.5094780325889587
28,2019,33889359,"Background and objectives: Pertussis is an infectious disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis. In Peru, actual public health programs indicate that vaccination against B. pertussis must be mandatory and generalized, besides all detected cases must be reported. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of B. pertussis among children under five years of age with a presumptive diagnosis of whopping cough in Cajamarca, a region located in northern Peru. Materials and methods: The population of this cross-sectional study were children under 5 years old hospitalized as presumptive cases of pertussis during December 2017 to December 2018. The nasopharyngeal samples were analyzed by real-time PCR for the detection of B. pertussis. Results: B. pertussis was identified as PCR + in 42.3% of our sample (33/78). The clinical presentation that was observed most frequently includes paroxysmal coughing (97%), difficulty breathing (69.7%), cyanosis (72.7%) and post-tussive emesis (60.6%). Additionally, pneumonia was the most observed complication (33.3%). Four of the patients with PCR+ for B. pertussis presented only lymphocytosis, five only leukocytosis, two patients with decreased leukocytosis and lymphocytes and only one patient with leukopenia and relative lymphocytosis. There was a percentage of 84.8% of unvaccinated children in the PCR+ group. Finally, the mother was the most frequent symptom carrier (18.2%). Conclusion: In conclusion, in the studied population there is a high rate of PCR+ cases for B. pertussis . Laboratory values may show leukopenia or lymphopenia in patients with pertussis. It is necessary to use appropriate laboratory diagnostic tests in all infants with respiratory symptoms for B. pertussis.

Although childhood vaccination has dramatically reduced reported pertussis cases, the incidence of the disease has increased over the past 20 years, most notably in previously immunized adolescents and adults. Pertussis should be suspected in patients of all ages with cough who meet the clinical criteria for the disease. Diagnostic tests currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for pertussis infection have low sensitivity. Regardless of test results, physicians should treat clinically suspected pertussis with antimicrobials and report cases to their state health department.

However, despite intensive vaccination of young children, pertussis remains a major public health problem in both developing and industrialized regions. Recent epidemics in California and Australia demonstrated that the agent of the disease is still circulating. They also revealed several aspects that must not be neglected concerning vaccine-preventable diseases. Indeed, pertussis is one of the oldest vaccine-preventable bacterial diseases, so can provide a good illustration of all of the aspects associated with the need for surveillance after the introduction of vaccination. (i) The type of vaccine: two types of pertussis vaccine, whole cell and acellular, inducing different types of immunity are now used around the world. (ii) The vaccine strategy, the vaccine coverage and the duration of vaccine immunity: pertussis epidemics provide evidence that 90% of the infants must be vaccinated, vaccination must be sufficiently early and both vaccine-induced immunity and natural infection-induced immunity to pertussis wane with time indicating that pertussis is not only a pediatric disease. (iii) The agents of the disease, Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis: the intensive vaccination of young infants modified the herd immunity, controlled bacteria similar to the vaccine strains but not all, revealing polymorphism of the agents of the disease evidencing the importance of continuing their isolation and their surveillance as well as monitoring their antibiotic resistance. (iv) The diagnosis of the disease: the epidemics showed the importance of specific diagnostic techniques that are easy to use by medical laboratories and the availability of the reagents required. (v) Communication with the public, the health authorities and the health providers: any changes of vaccine type, vaccine strategy, characteristics of the disease, and biological diagnosis must be associated with appropriate communication with the public and training of healthcare workers.

28,2019,35324684,"Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a respiratory disease caused by infection with Bordetella pertussis , which releases several virulence factors, including the AB-type pertussis toxin (PT). The characteristic symptom is severe, long-lasting paroxysmal coughing. Especially in newborns and infants, pertussis symptoms, such as leukocytosis, can become life-threatening. Despite an available vaccination, increasing case numbers have been reported worldwide, including Western countries such as Germany and the USA. Antibiotic treatment is available and important to prevent further transmission. However, antibiotics only reduce symptoms if administered in early stages, which rarely occurs due to a late diagnosis. Thus, no causative treatments against symptoms of whooping cough are currently available. The AB-type protein toxin PT is a main virulence factor and consists of a binding subunit that facilitates transport of an enzyme subunit into the cytosol of target cells. There, the enzyme subunit ADP-ribosylates inhibitory α-subunits of G-protein coupled receptors resulting in disturbed cAMP signaling. As an important virulence factor associated with severe symptoms, such as leukocytosis, and poor outcomes, PT represents an attractive drug target to develop novel therapeutic strategies. In this review, chaperone inhibitors, human peptides, small molecule inhibitors, and humanized antibodies are discussed as novel strategies to inhibit PT.",Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for whooping cough (pertussis)?,antibiotics whooping cough,1.0,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for whooping cough (pertussis)?,0.5028191208839417
28,2019,24364571,"Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is an acute respiratory tract infection that has increased in incidence in recent years. The initial catarrhal stage presents with nonspecific symptoms of malaise, rhinorrhea, sneezing, lacrimation, and mild cough. During the paroxysmal stage, severe outbreaks of coughing often lead to the classic high-pitched whooping sound patients make when gasping for breath. The paroxysmal stage is followed by the convalescent stage and resolution of symptoms. Complications vary by age, with infants more likely to experience severe complications such as apnea, pneumonia, seizures, or death. In adolescents and adults, complications are the result of chronic cough. The diagnosis depends on clinical signs and laboratory testing. Both culture and polymerase chain reaction testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis; serologic testing is not standardized or routinely recommended. Although antibiotics have not shown clear effectiveness in the treatment of pertussis, they eradicate nasal bacterial carriage and may reduce transmission rates. Macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin are first-line treatments to prevent transmission; trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is an alternative in cases of allergy or intolerance to macrolides. Immunization against pertussis is essential for disease prevention. Current recommendations in the United States consist of administering five doses of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine to children before seven years of age, and administering a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) booster between 11 and 18 years of age.

However, the best option for empirical antibiotics for treatment on an ambulatory basis, as well as in those requiring hospitalization, is still unclear. This review tries to answer the question regarding the most appropriate antibiotics in different settings in children with CAP as well as duration of therapy. Recent findings: Recent studies have provided insights regarding use of oral antibiotics in children with mild to moderate CAP, and severe CAP with lower chest retractions but no hypoxia. In view of rapidly emerging resistance among various causative pathogens, several new drugs have been currently approved, or are under trial for CAP in children. Current knowledge suggests that the choice of antibiotics for ambulatory treatment of CAP is oral amoxicillin with a duration of 3-5 days. Children with CAP with lower chest retractions but no hypoxia can be treated with oral amoxicillin. Severe pneumonia can be treated with intravenous antibiotics consisting of penicillin/ampicillin with or without an aminoglycoside. Several new drugs have been developed and approved for use in CAP caused by multidrug-resistant organisms, but these should be used judiciously to avoid emergence of further resistance.

Presently, too many children receive unneeded antibiotics or, when antibiotics are mandatory, the choice of the drug is not appropriate. Areas covered: In this paper, the authors discuss the remaining unsolved problems for rational antibiotic therapy use in pediatric community-acquired pneumonia and provide their expert perspectives. Expert opinion: Further improvement in pediatric CAP management could be derived from physician education on antibiotic use and a larger use, particularly in office practice, of point of care testing or new technologies (i.e. artificial intelligence) to define etiology of a lower respiratory infection. However, recommendations regarding the duration of antibiotic therapy vary largely because of the absence of reliable data on the optimal CAP treatment according to the bacterial etiology of the disease, its severity, and child characteristics. Available evidence seems to confirm that a short course of antibiotics, approximately 5 days, can be effective and lead to results not substantially different from those obtained with prolonged-course antibiotic therapy, at least in patients with mild to moderate disease.",Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,antibiotics children pneumonia,1.0,Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,0.15971624851226807

Most children can be managed empirically with oral antibiotics as outpatients without specific laboratory investigations. Those with severe infections or with persistent or worsening symptoms need more intensive investigations and may need admission to hospital. The choice and dosage of antibiotics should be based on the age of the patient, severity of the pneumonia and knowledge of local antimicrobial resistance patterns.

Objectives: To identify effective antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children by comparing various antibiotics. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1966 to September 2009); and EMBASE (1990 to September 2009). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children of either sex, comparing at least two antibiotics for CAP within hospital or ambulatory (outpatient) settings. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data from full articles of selected studies. Main results: There were 27 studies, which enroled 11,928 children, comparing multiple antibiotics. None compared antibiotic with placebo.For ambulatory treatment of non-severe CAP, amoxycillin compared with co-trimoxazole had similar failure rates (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.47) and cure rates (OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.03). (Three studies involved 3952 children).In children hospitalised with severe CAP, oral amoxycillin compared with injectable penicillin or ampicillin had similar failure rates (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.15). (Three studies involved 3942 children). Relapse rates were similar in the two groups (OR 1.28; 95% CI 0.34 to 4.82).In very severe CAP, death rates were higher in children receiving chloramphenicol compared to those receiving penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin (OR 1.25; 95% CI 0.76 to 2.07). (One study involved 1116 children). Authors' conclusions: There were many studies with different methodologies investigating multiple antibiotics. For treatment of ambulatory patients with CAP, amoxycillin is an alternative to co-trimoxazole. With limited data on other antibiotics, co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefpodoxime may be alternative second-line drugs. For severe pneumonia without hypoxia, oral amoxycillin may be an alternative to injectable penicillin in hospitalised children; however, for ambulatory treatment of such patients with oral antibiotics, more studies in community settings are required. For children hospitalised with severe and very severe CAP, penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin is superior to chloramphenicol. The other alternative drugs for such patients are ceftrioxone, levofloxacin, co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefuroxime. Until more studies are available, these can be used as a second-line therapy.There is a need for more studies with larger patient populations and similar methodologies to compare newer antibiotics.",Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,antibiotics children pneumonia,1.0,Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,0.15732848644256592

One of the known mechanisms in the tinnitus area with unknown reason is oxidative events. Based on the prevalence and economic costs and physical- psychological side effects caused by tinnitus and the importance of finding a suitable solution for its prevention and treatment, the need for further studies becomes more obvious in this context. This review article aimed to review studies on the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba as a medicinal plant on patients with tinnitus. Evidence acquisitions: Google Scholar, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), PubMed, LISTA (EBSCO) and Web of Science have been searched. Results: There are many studies on the therapeutic effect of Ginkgo biloba on patients with tinnitus. Most findings are in contrast with each other so that some of studies reported that Ginkgo biloba is effective in the treatment of tinnitus and other studies referred to it as ineffective herbal medicine. Generally, according to the previous studies and the present study, it can mention that the Ginkgo biloba may somewhat improve tinnitus.

However, there also appears to be a strong placebo effect in tinnitus management. Objectives: To assess the effect of Ginkgo biloba in patients who are troubled by tinnitus. Search strategy: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library Issue 4 2003), MEDLINE (1966 - 2003), EMBASE (1974 - 2003), and reference lists of identified publications. Date of the most recent search was December 2003. Selection criteria: Adults (18 years and over) complaining of tinnitus. Adults with a primary complaint of cerebral insufficiency where tinnitus forms part of the syndrome. Data collection and analysis: Both reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. Main results: Twelve trials were identified from the search as being relevant to the review. Ten trials were excluded on methodological grounds. No trials of tinnitus in cerebral insufficiency reached a satisfactory standard for inclusion in the review. There was no evidence that Ginkgo biloba was effective for the primary complaint of tinnitus. The incidence of side effects was small.

32,2019,21857784,"Tinnitus is a symptom frequently encountered by ear, nose, and throat practitioners. A causal treatment is rarely possible, and drug and nondrug treatment options are limited. One of the frequently prescribed treatments is Ginkgo biloba extract.

There is evidence of efficacy for the standardized extract, EGb 761(®) (Dr Willmar Schwabe GmbH &amp; Co KG Pharmaceuticals, Karlsruhe, Germany), in the treatment of tinnitus from three trials in patients in whom tinnitus was the primary complaint. Supportive evidence comes from a further five trials in patients with age-associated cognitive impairment or dementia in whom tinnitus was present as a concomitant symptom. As yet, the efficacy of other ginkgo preparations has not been proven, which does not necessarily indicate ineffectiveness, but may be due to flawed clinical trials.

32,2019,15998570,"The investigation into the effects of Ginkgo biloba extracts on tinnitus has suffered from a dearth of effective animal models as well as systematic clinical trials employing double-blind and placebo-controlled designs. Some clinical trials have yielded positive results, however, these studies are few and have been limited either by design flaws, the small size of the significant effects, or else the results have not been published in peer-reviewed journals and therefore the quality of the research is not assured. By contrast, the two most systematic clinical trials, both double-blind and placebo controlled, and published in respected peer-reviewed journals, have yielded negative results and suggest that Ginkgo biloba extracts are of little more use in the treatment of tinnitus than a placebo. Treatments for tinnitus that do not have therapeutic efficacy not only waste money but can potentially prevent patients from seeking therapy that is efficacious. Furthermore, the unsupervised use of Ginkgo biloba extracts with other medications could lead to adverse side effects which are unnecessary and not justified in terms of therapeutic benefit.",Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,ginkgo biloba tinnitus,0.0,Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,0.0001716137194307521
32,2019,21765586,"Subjective tinnitus, the phantom ringing or buzzing sensation that occurs in the absence of sound, affects 12-14% of adults; in some cases the tinnitus is so severe or disabling that patients seek medical treatment. However, although the economic and emotional impact of tinnitus is large, there are currently no FDA-approved drugs to treat this condition. Clinical trials are now underway to evaluate the efficacy of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and dopamine D(2) antagonists, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists and zinc dietary supplements. Previous off-label clinical studies, while not definitive, suggest that patients with severe depression may experience improvement in their tinnitus after treatment with antidepressants such as nortriptyline or sertraline. A small subpopulation of patients with what has been described as ""typewriter tinnitus"" have been shown to gain significant relief from the anticonvulsant carbamazepine. Preliminary studies with misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue, and sulpiride, a dopamine D(2) antagonist, have shown promise. Animal behavioral studies suggest that GABA transaminase inhibitors and potassium channel modulators can suppress tinnitus. Additionally, improvements in tinnitus have also been noted in patients taking melatonin for significant sleep disturbances.

32,2019,23543524,"Background: This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 2, 2004 and previously updated in 2007 and 2009.Tinnitus can be described as the perception of sound in the absence of external acoustic stimulation. At present no specific therapy for tinnitus is acknowledged to be satisfactory in all patients. There are a number of reports in the literature suggesting that Ginkgo biloba may be effective in the management of tinnitus. However, there also appears to be a strong placebo effect in tinnitus management. Objectives: To assess the effect of Ginkgo biloba in patients who are troubled by tinnitus. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; AMED; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 12 March 2012. Selection criteria: Adults (18 years and over) complaining of tinnitus or adults with a primary complaint of cerebral insufficiency, where tinnitus forms part of the syndrome. Data collection and analysis: Both original authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. For the 2012 update two authors determined trial eligibility, extracted data, analysed data and updated the contents of the review. Main results: Four trials with a total of 1543 participants were included in the review; we assessed all the included studies as having a low risk of bias. Three trials (1143 participants) included patients with a primary complaint of tinnitus and one (400 participants) included patients with mild to moderate dementia, some of whom had tinnitus.There was no evidence that Gingko biloba was effective in patients with a primary complaint of tinnitus. In the study of patients with dementia, mean baseline levels of tinnitus were low (1.7 to 2.5 on a 10-point subjective symptom rating scale). A small but statistically significant reduction of 1.5 and 0.7 points was seen in patients taking Gingko biloba with vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease respectively. The practical clinical significance of this is unclear. The incidence of side effects was low. Authors' conclusions: The limited evidence does not demonstrate that Ginkgo biloba is effective for tinnitus when this is the primary complaint.",Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,ginkgo biloba tinnitus,0.0,Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,0.37645336985588074
32,2019,15142066,"The objective was to ascertain if Ginkgo biloba benefits patients with tinnitus. The study design was: 1. Randomized double blind trial of Ginkgo biloba versus placebo; 2. A meta-analysis of randomized placebo controlled double blind trials. Participants included 66 adult patients with tinnitus and six (including our study) randomized placebo controlled double blind trials were meta-analysed. The main outcome measures were the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Glasgow Health Status Inventory (GHSI) and average of hearing threshold at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz. In the meta-analysis the proportion of patients gaining benefit and an overall odds ratio were determined. The results showed the mean difference in change of the THI, GHSI and hearing between Ginkgo biloba (n = 31) and placebo group (n = 29) was 2.51 (CI -10.1, 5.1, P = 0.51), 0.58 (CI-4.8, 3.6, P = 0.38) and 0.68 db (CI -4.13, 2.8, P = 0.69). Meta-analysis revealed 21.6% of Ginkgo biloba treated patients (n = 107/552) gained benefit versus 18.4% (n = 87/504) of placebo treated patients with an odds ratio of 1.24 (CI 0.89, 1.71).

Participants: 1121 healthy people aged between 18 and 70 years with tinnitus that was comparatively stable; 978 participants were matched (489 pairs). Intervention: 12 weeks' treatment with either 50 mg Ginkgo biloba extract LI 1370 three times daily or placebo. Main outcome measures: Participants' assessment of tinnitus before, during, and after treatment. Questionnaires included items assessing perception of how loud and how troublesome tinnitus was. Changes in loudness were rated on a six point scale. Changes in how troublesome were rated on a five point scale. Results: There were no significant differences in primary or secondary outcome measures between the groups. 34 of 360 participants receiving active treatment reported that their tinnitus was less troublesome after 12 weeks of treatment compared with 35 of 360 participants who took placebo.

The patients included in the open study were patients who had been referred to the Department of Audiology, Sahlgren's Hospital, Göteborg, Sweden, due to persistent severe tinnitus. Patients reporting a positive effect on tinnitus in the open study were included in the double-blind placebo-controlled study (20 out of 21 patients participated). 7 patients preferred GBE to placebo, 7 placebo to GBE and 6 patients had no preference. Statistical group analysis gives no support to the hypothesis that GBE has any effect on tinnitus, although it is possible that GBE has an effect on some patients due to several reasons, e.g. the diverse etiology of tinnitus.

It is intended to act on underlying impulses to weaken the desire to smoke, or strengthen the will to stop. Objectives: To evaluate the effect and safety of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation. Search methods: For this update we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, and trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), using the terms ""smoking cessation"" and ""hypnotherapy"" or ""hypnosis"", with no restrictions on language or publication date. The most recent search was performed on 18 July 2018. Selection criteria: We considered randomized controlled trials that recruited people who smoked and implemented a hypnotherapy intervention for smoking cessation compared with no treatment, or with any other therapeutic interventions. Trials were required to report smoking cessation rates at least six months after the beginning of treatment. Study eligibility was determined by at least two review authors, independently. Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors independently extracted data on participant characteristics, the type and duration of hypnotherapy, the nature of the control group, smoking status, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. These authors also independently assessed the quality of the included studies. In undertaking this work, we used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months' follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated abstinence rates where available. Those lost to follow-up were considered to still be smoking. We summarized effects as risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. We also noted any adverse events reported. Main results: We included three new trials in this update, which brings the total to 14 included studies that compared hypnotherapy with 22 different control interventions. The studies included a total of 1926 participants. Studies were diverse and a single meta-analysis was not possible. We judged only one study to be at low risk of bias overall; we judged 10 studies to be at high risk of bias and three at unclear risk. Studies did not provide reliable evidence of a greater benefit from hypnotherapy compared with other interventions or no treatment for smoking cessation. Most individual studies did not find statistically significant differences in quit rates after six months or longer, and studies that did detect differences typically had methodological limitations.Pooling small groups of relatively comparable studies did not provide reliable evidence for a specific effect of hypnotherapy relative to controls. There was low certainty evidence, limited by imprecision and risk of bias, that showed no statistically significant difference between hypnotherapy and attention-matched behavioural treatments (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.61; I<sup>2</sup> = 36%; 6 studies, 957 participants). Results were similarly imprecise, and also limited by risk of bias, when comparing hypnotherapy to intensive behavioural interventions (not matched for contact time) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.82; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 211 participants; very low certainty evidence). Results from one small study (40 participants) detected a statistically significant benefit of hypnotherapy compared to no intervention (RR 19.00, 95% CI 1.18 to 305.88), but this evidence was judged to be of very low certainty due to high risk of bias and imprecision. No significant differences were detected in comparisons of hypnotherapy with brief behavioural interventions (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.69; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 269 participants), rapid/focused smoking (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.33; I<sup>2</sup> = 65%; 2 studies, 54 participants), and pharmacotherapies (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.20; I<sup>2</sup> = 5%; 2 studies, 197 participants). When hypnotherapy was evaluated as an adjunct to other treatments, the pooled result from five studies showed a statistically significant benefit in favour of hypnotherapy (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.35; I² = 62%; 224 participants); however, this result should be interpreted with caution due to the high risk of bias across studies (four had a high risk or bias, one had an unclear risk), and substantial statistical heterogeneity.Most studies did not provide information on whether data specifically relating to adverse events were collected, and whether or not any adverse events occurred. One study that did collect such data did not find a statistically significant difference in the adverse event 'index' between hypnotherapy and relaxation. Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to determine whether hypnotherapy is more effective for smoking cessation than other forms of behavioural support or unassisted quitting. If a benefit is present, current evidence suggests the benefit is small at most. There is very little evidence on whether hypnotherapy causes adverse effects, but the existing data show no evidence that it does.

33,2019,24559809,"Background: The efficacy of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is well documented. However, due to relapse rates and side effects, hypnotherapy is gaining attention as an alternative treatment option. The aim of this one-center randomized study was to compare the efficacy of hypnotherapy alone, as well as hypnotherapy with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), to conventional NRT in patients hospitalized with a cardiac or pulmonary illness. Methods: We evaluated self-reported and biochemically verified 7-day prevalence smoking abstinence rates at 12 and 26 weeks post-hospitalization. Patients (n=164) were randomized into one of three counseling-based treatment groups: NRT for 30 days (NRT; n=41), a 90-min hypnotherapy session (H; n=39), and NRT with hypnotherapy (HNRT; n=37). Treatment groups were compared to a ""self-quit"" group of 35 patients who refused intervention. Results: Hypnotherapy patients were more likely than NRT patients to be nonsmokers at 12 weeks (43.9% vs. 28.2%; p=0.14) and 26 weeks after hospitalization (36.6% vs. 18.0%; p=0.06). Smoking abstinence rates in the HNRT group were similar to the H group. There was no difference in smoking abstinence rates at 26 weeks between ""self quit"" and participants in any of the treatment groups. In multivariable regression analysis adjusting for diagnosis and demographic characteristics, H and HNRT were over three times more likely than NRT participants to abstain at 26-weeks post-discharge (RR=3.6; p=0.03 and RR=3.2; p=0.04, respectively).

We aimed to investigate the efficacy of a single-session of group hypnotherapy for smoking cessation compared to relaxation in Swiss adult smokers. Methods: This was a cluster-randomised, parallel-group, controlled trial. A single session of hypnosis or relaxation for smoking cessation was delivered to groups of smokers (median size = 11). Participants were 223 smokers consuming ≥ 5 cigarettes per day, willing to quit and not using cessation aids (47.1% females, M = 37.5 years [SD = 11.8], 86.1% Swiss). Nicotine withdrawal, smoking abstinence self-efficacy, and adverse reactions were assessed at a 2-week follow-up. The main outcome, self-reported 30-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence, was assessed at a 6-month follow up. Abstinence was validated through salivary analysis. Secondary outcomes included number of cigarettes smoked per day, smoking abstinence self-efficacy, and nicotine withdrawal. Results: At the 6-month follow up, 14.7% in the hypnosis group and 17.8% in the relaxation group were abstinent. The intervention had no effect on smoking status (p = .73) or on the number of cigarettes smoked per day (p = .56). Smoking abstinence self-efficacy did not differ between the interventions (p = .14) at the 2-week follow-up, but non-smokers in the hypnosis group experienced reduced withdrawal (p = .02).

They were evaluated before and after treatment using a quality-of-life questionnaire, pad test, micturition diary and subjective evaluation. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the population. The homogeneity of the two groups was evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-squared tests. The success of the two groups after treatment was evaluated using the Wilcoxon test. Results: The supervised group showed statistically greater improvement in the pad test, micturition diary and quality of life than did the control group. In the subjective evaluation, only 23.8% of the control group patients were satised with their treatment. In the supervised group, 66.8% of patients did not want any other treatment.

Aim: This article will review the available evidence on incidence, pathophysiology, and treatment of coital urinary incontinence with the attempt to present the current state of the art. Methods: PubMed was searched for reports about coital urinary incontinence that were published from 1970 to 2008, and the most relevant articles were reviewed. Main outcome measures: Review on epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of coital incontinence. Results: The incidence of coital incontinence in incontinent women has been reported to range between 10% and 27%. At present, some evidence suggests an association between urinary leakage at penetration and urodynamic stress (USI) incontinence as well as urinary leakage during orgasm and detrusor overactivity (DO). When treatment for these conditions are based upon urodynamic findings, pelvic floor muscle training, surgery, and pharmacotherapy show satisfactory cure rates. Conclusions: Coital urinary incontinence deserves much more attention in clinical practice: women should be specifically interviewed for this disturbance because it has a very negative impact on their sexuality.

34,2019,34048957,"Objectives: To determine the real-world effectiveness of pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT) recommendations for patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 70 women who were advised to undergo PFMT after their initial urogynaecology consultation for lower urinary tract symptoms and/or pelvic organ prolapse. About half (51%) of potential participants consented to answer our telephone survey. We calculated the proportion of patients who complied with the recommendation of PFMT, and we subjectively assessed whether these patients found PFMT to be helpful. We also collected demographic data and looked for reasons why patients did not attend PFMT. Chi-square, 2-tailed t, or Fisher exact tests were used to compare differences between patients who attended and those who did not. Results: During the 6-month period after their initial consultation, only 28 of 70 women (40%) followed the recommendation to attend PFMT. Sixteen of the 28 women who attended PFMT (57%) reported that they found it helpful. Therefore, the ""real-world effectiveness"" of the entire study sample was 23%, with only 16 of 70 women benefiting from PFMT. Time constraints (27%) and cost (18%) were the top 2 reasons given for not attending. Conclusions: Despite evidence-based recommendations in favour of PFMT for various pelvic floor disorders, its real-world effectiveness is quite low. A public health commitment to providing access to PFMT would be of significant benefit.",How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,exercises for female incontinence,1.0,How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,0.29638609290122986

34,2019,20828949,"Urinary incontinence is a common problem among adults and conservative management is recommended as the first-line treatment. Physical therapies, particularly pelvic floor muscle exercise, are the mainstay of such conservative management. The purpose of this review is to summarise current literature and describe trends in the use of pelvic floor muscle exercise in the management of urinary incontinence in women. Our review confirms that pelvic floor muscle exercise is particularly beneficial in the treatment of urinary stress incontinence in females. Studies have shown up to 70% improvement in symptoms of stress incontinence following appropriately performed pelvic floor exercise. This improvement is evident across all age groups. There is evidence that women perform better with exercise regimes supervised by specialist physiotherapists or continence nurses, as opposed to unsupervised or leaflet-based care. There is evidence for the widespread recommendation that pelvic floor muscle exercise helps women with all types of urinary incontinence.

34,2019,24183730,"Objectives: We previously reported high rates of urinary incontinence among gynecologic cancer survivors and aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a simple intervention for treatment of urinary incontinence in this population. Methods: We recruited 40 gynecologic cancer survivors who reported urinary incontinence on a validated questionnaire. Women were randomized to either pelvic floor muscle training/behavioral therapy (treatment group) or usual care (control group). The primary outcome measure, assessed at 12 weeks post intervention, was a 40% difference in the validated Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) score. Fisher's exact test was used to identify differences between groups for frequency data; two-sample t-test was conducted for continuous measurements. Results: Mean age of this cohort was 57 (range: 37-79). The majority of the survivors had uterine cancer (60%), 18% had received radiation therapy, 95% had received surgical therapy, and 35% had received chemotherapy. At three months, 80% of the treatment and 40% of the control group reported that their urinary incontinence was ""much better"" or ""very much better"" as evaluated by the Patient Global Impression of Improvement scale (p=0.02). Brink's scores were significantly improved in the treatment group as compared to those of the controls (p 0.0001). Treatment group adherence was high; the treatment group performed exercises with an average of 22 days/month. Conclusions: Urinary incontinence negatively affects quality of life, and despite a high prevalence among gynecologic cancer survivors, it is often under-assessed and undertreated.

36,2019,23543512,"Background: Dental sealants were introduced in the 1960s to help prevent dental caries in the pits and fissures of mainly the occlusal tooth surfaces. Sealants act to prevent the growth of bacteria that can lead to dental decay. There is evidence to suggest that fissure sealants are effective in preventing caries in children and adolescents when compared to no sealants. Their effectiveness may be related to the caries prevalence in the population. Objectives: To compare the effects of different types of fissure sealants in preventing caries in permanent teeth in children and adolescents. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 1 November 2012); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 1 November 2012); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 1 November 2012); SCISEARCH, CAplus, INSPEC, NTIS and PASCAL via STN Easy (to 1 September 2012); and DARE, NHS EED and HTA (via the CAIRS web interface to 29 March 2012 and thereafter via Metaxis interface to September 2012). There were no language or publication restrictions. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov (to 23 July 2012). Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of at least 12 months duration comparing sealants for preventing caries of occlusal or approximal surfaces of premolar or molar teeth with no sealant or different type of sealant in children and adolescents under 20 years of age. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for caries or no caries on occlusal surfaces of permanent molar teeth. For trials with a split-mouth design, the Becker-Balagtas odds ratio was used. For mean caries increment we used the mean difference. All measures are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE methods. We conducted the meta-analyses using a random-effects model for those comparisons where there were more than three trials in the same comparison, otherwise the fixed-effect model was used. Main results: Thirty-four trials are included in the review. Twelve trials evaluated the effects of sealant compared with no sealant (2575 participants) (one of those 12 trials stated only number of tooth pairs); 21 trials evaluated one type of sealant compared with another (3202 participants); and one trial evaluated two different types of sealant and no sealant (752 participants). Children were aged from 5 to 16 years. Trials rarely reported the background exposure to fluoride of the trial participants or the baseline caries prevalence.- Resin-based sealant compared with no sealant: Compared to control without sealant, second or third or fourth generation resin-based sealants prevented caries in first permanent molars in children aged 5 to 10 years (at 2 years of follow-up odds ratio (OR) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.19, six trials (five published in the 1970s and one in 2012), at low risk of bias, 1259 children randomised, 1066 children evaluated, moderate quality evidence). If we were to assume that 40% of the control tooth surfaces were decayed during 2 years of follow-up (400 carious teeth per 1000), then applying a resin-based sealant will reduce the proportion of the carious surfaces to 6.25% (95% CI 3.84% to 9.63%); similarly if we were to assume that 70% of the control tooth surfaces were decayed (700 carious teeth per 1000), then applying a resin-based sealant will reduce the proportion of the carious surfaces to 18.92% (95% CI 12.28% to 27.18%). This caries preventive effect was maintained at longer follow-up but both the quality and quantity of the evidence was reduced (e.g. at 48 to 54 months of follow-up OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.28, four trials (two studies at low risk of bias and two studies at high risk of bias), 482 children evaluated; risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.45, one study at unclear risk of bias, 203 children evaluated).- Glass ionomer sealant compared with no sealant: There is insufficient evidence to make any conclusions about whether glass ionomer sealants, prevent caries compared to no sealant at 24-month follow-up (mean difference in DFS -0.18, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.03, one trial at unclear risk of bias, 452 children randomised, 404 children evaluated, very low quality evidence).- Sealant compared with another sealant: The relative effectiveness of different types of sealants remained inconclusive in this review. Twenty-one trials directly compared two different sealant materials. Several different comparisons were made according to type of sealant, outcome measure and duration of follow-up. There was great variation with regard to comparisons, outcomes, time of outcomes reported and background fluoride exposure if this was reported.Fifteen trials compared glass ionomer with resin sealants and there is insufficient evidence to make any conclusions about the superiority of either of the two materials. Although there were 15 trials the event rate was very low in many of these which restricted their contribution to the results.Three trials compared resin-modified glass ionomer with resin sealant and reported inconsistent results.Two small low quality trials compared polyacid-modified resin sealants with resin sealants and found no difference in caries after 2 years.- Adverse effects: Only two trials mentioned adverse effects and stated that no adverse effects were reported by participants. Authors' conclusions: The application of sealants is a recommended procedure to prevent or control caries. Sealing the occlusal surfaces of permanent molars in children and adolescents reduces caries up to 48 months when compared to no sealant, after longer follow-up the quantity and quality of the evidence is reduced. The review revealed that sealants are effective in high risk children but information on the magnitude of the benefit of sealing in other conditions is scarce.

36,2019,9071271,"Most childhood tooth decay is preventable with a combination of fluoride--which protects the smooth surfaces of a tooth--and dental sealants--which protect tooth surfaces with irregularities called pits and fissures. Sealants are plastic coatings that protect these vulnerable areas, often narrower than a single toothbrush bristle, from decay-causing bacteria and food in the mouth. Yet, 1988-1991 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed that while many children still had cavities, over 80% of which were related to pits and fissures, relatively few children had sealants applied to permanent teeth. As caries has gone from a ubiquitous disease to one affecting only half of children in early elementary school and two-thirds of those who are 15 years of age, dentists must consider how to best target sealants to individual children who are at greatest risk for new disease. Most sealants are placed in private dental offices, but children at greatest risk for problems resulting from tooth decay are least likely to get private care. State and local health departments, therefore, have gone after hard-to-reach children and adolescents through school-based and school-linked sealant programs, often using portable dental equipment.

Sealants act to prevent bacteria growth that can lead to dental decay. Evidence suggests that fissure sealants are effective in preventing caries in children and adolescents compared to no sealants. Effectiveness may, however, be related to caries incidence level of the population. This is an update of a review published in 2004, 2008 and 2013. Objectives: To compare the effects of different types of fissure sealants in preventing caries in occlusal surfaces of permanent teeth in children and adolescents. Search methods: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 3 August 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 3 August 2016), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 3 August 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials to 3 August 2016. No restrictions were placed on language or date of publication. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sealants with no sealant or a different type of sealant material for preventing caries of occlusal surfaces of premolar or molar teeth in children and adolescents aged up to 20 years. Studies required at least 12 months follow-up. We excluded studies that compared compomers to resins/composites. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We presented outcomes for caries or no caries on occlusal surfaces of permanent molar teeth as odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR). We used mean difference (MD) for mean caries increment. All measures were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model for comparisons where there were more than three trials; otherwise we used the fixed-effect model. We used GRADE methods to assess evidence quality. Main results: We included 38 trials that involved a total of 7924 children; seven trials were new for this update (1693 participants). Fifteen trials evaluated the effects of resin-based sealant versus no sealant (3620 participants in 14 studies plus 575 tooth pairs in one study); three trials with evaluated glass ionomer sealant versus no sealant (905 participants); and 24 trials evaluated one type of sealant versus another (4146 participants). Children were aged from 5 to 16 years. Trials rarely reported background exposure to fluoride of trial participants or baseline caries prevalence. Resin-based sealant versus no sealant: second-, third- and fourth-generation resin-based sealants prevented caries in first permanent molars in children aged 5 to 10 years (at 24 months follow-up: OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.19, 7 trials (5 published in the 1970s; 2 in the 2010s), 1548 children randomised, 1322 children evaluated; moderate-quality evidence). If we were to assume that 16% of the control tooth surfaces were decayed during 24 months of follow-up (160 carious teeth per 1000), then applying a resin-based sealant would reduce the proportion of carious surfaces to 5.2% (95% CI 3.13% to 7.37%). Similarly, assuming that 40% of control tooth surfaces were decayed (400 carious teeth per 1000), then applying a resin-based sealant would reduce the proportion of carious surfaces to 6.25% (95% CI 3.84% to 9.63%). If 70% of control tooth surfaces were decayed, there would be 19% decayed surfaces in the sealant group (95% CI 12.3% to 27.2%). This caries-preventive effect was maintained at longer follow-up but evidence quality and quantity was reduced (e.g. at 48 to 54 months of follow-up: OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.28, 4 trials, 482 children evaluated; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.45, 203 children evaluated). Although studies were generally well conducted, we assessed blinding of outcome assessment for caries at high risk of bias for all trials (blinding of outcome assessment is not possible in sealant studies because outcome assessors can see and identify sealant). Glass ionomer sealant versus no sealant: was evaluated by three studies. Results at 24 months were inconclusive (very low-quality evidence). One sealant versus another sealant: the relative effectiveness of different types of sealants is unknown (very low-quality evidence). We included 24 trials that directly compared two different sealant materials. Comparisons varied in terms of types of sealant assessed, outcome measures chosen and duration of follow-up. Adverse events: only four trials assessed adverse events. No adverse events were reported. Authors' conclusions: Resin-based sealants applied on occlusal surfaces of permanent molars are effective for preventing caries in children and adolescents. Our review found moderate-quality evidence that resin-based sealants reduced caries by between 11% and 51% compared to no sealant, when measured at 24 months. Similar benefit was seen at timepoints up to 48 months; after longer follow-up, the quantity and quality of evidence was reduced. There was insufficient evidence to judge the effectiveness of glass ionomer sealant or the relative effectiveness of different types of sealants.

36,2019,19234725,"The aim of the present study was the quantification of Streptococcus mutans adhesion on ten widely used pit and fissure sealant materials and the correlation of these findings to surface roughness (R(a)) and surface free energy (SFE). Additionally, changes in streptococcal adhesion and surface parameters after water immersion and artificial aging have been investigated. Circular specimens of ten fissure sealants (seven resin-based composites, two glass ionomers, and one compomer) were made and polished. Surface roughness was determined by perthometer and SFE by goniometer measurements. Sealant materials were incubated with S. mutans suspension (2.5 h, 37 degrees C), and adhering bacteria were quantified by using a biofluorescence assay in combination with an automated plate reader. Surface properties and S. mutans adhesion were measured prior to and after water immersion after 1 and 6 months and after additional thermocycling (5,000 cycles; 5 degrees C/55 degrees C). The tested sealants showed significant differences in S. mutans adhesion prior to and after the applied aging procedures. Aging resulted in slight increases (mostly 0.2 microm) in surface roughness, as well as in significant decreases in SFE and in significantly lower quantities of adhering bacteria. Ketac Bond and UltraSeal XT plus revealed the lowest adhesion potential after artificial aging.

36,2019,27764075,"Background: Tooth decay is one of the greatest unmet treatment needs among children. Pain and suffering associated with untreated dental disease can lead to problems with eating, speaking, and learning. School-based dental sealant programs (SBSP) deliver a highly effective intervention to prevent tooth decay in children who might not receive regular dental care. SBSPs benefits exceed their costs when they target children at high risk for tooth decay. Methods: CDC used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014 to estimate current prevalences of sealant use and untreated tooth decay among low-income (≤185% of federal poverty level) and higher-income children aged 6-11 years and compared these estimates with 1999-2004 NHANES data. The mean number of decayed and filled first molars (DFFM) was estimated for children with and without sealants. Averted tooth decay resulting from increasing sealant use prevalence was also estimated. All reported differences are significant at p 0.05. Results: From 1999-2004 to 2011-2014, among low- and higher-income children, sealant use prevalence increased by 16.2 and 8.8 percentage points to 38.7% and 47.8%, respectively. Among low-income children aged 7-11 years, the mean DFFM was almost three times higher among children without sealants (0.82) than among children with sealants. Approximately 6.5 million low-income children could potentially benefit from the delivery of sealants through SBSP. Conclusions and implications for public health practice: The prevalence of dental sealant use has increased; however, most children have not received sealants. Increasing sealant use prevalence could substantially reduce untreated decay, associated problems, and dental treatment costs.",Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,0.7698764204978943

Although the evidence appears to be inconclusive, narrative reviews and clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of laxatives (and fiber) for the treatment of hemorrhoids and relief of symptoms. This is due to their safety and low cost. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of laxatives on a wide range of symptoms in people with symptomatic hemorrhoids. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1980 to 2005), CINAHL (1982 to 2005), BIOSIS, and AMED (Allied and Alternative Medicine Database), for eligible trials (including conference proceedings). We sought missing and additional information from authors, industry, and experts in the field. Selection criteria: We selected all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials that compared any type of laxative to placebo or no therapy in any patient population. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion and retrieved all potentially relevant studies. Data were extracted from studies that met our selection criteria on study population, intervention used, pre-specified outcomes, and methodology. We extracted methodological information for the assessment of internal validity: existence and method of generation of the randomization schedule, and method of allocation concealment; blinding of caregivers and outcomes assessors; numbers of and reasons for participants lost to follow up; and use of validated outcome measures. Main results: Seven randomised trials enrolling a total of 378 participants to fiber or a non-fiber control were identified. Meta-analyses using random-effects models showed that laxatives in the form of fiber had a beneficial effect in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids. The risk of not improving hemorrhoids and having persisting symptoms decreased by 53% in the fiber group (risk reduction (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.68). These results are compatible with large treatment effects regarding prolapse, pain, itching, although the pooled analyses showed a tendency toward no-effect for these parametres. The effect on bleeding showed a significant difference in favour of the fiber (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89). Studies including data on multiple follow ups (usually after six weeks and three months) showed consistent results over time. However, we have to stress two possible limitations of this review: the risk of publication bias, and only moderate study quality.

37,2019,35188048,"Background: Several techniques were developed for managing hemorrhoidal disease, but their use in clinical practice and the general management of the condition seems highly variable in Saudi Arabia. Consensus panel: To develop consensus recommendations that ensure the best possible diagnosis and treatment of hemorrhoidal disease in Saudi Arabia, the consensus panel consisted of experts in surgery in Saudi Arabia who met from December 2017 to September 2018. Consensus findings: The discussions focused on the need: to set up a proctology society in Saudi Arabia to assess the prevalence of hemorrhoidal disease and to regulate the role of health-care professionals (HCPs) in the management of the disease; to initiate guidelines to ensure proper diagnosis (considering symptoms, medical history, and physical/clinical examination) and treatment (topical creams and suppositories should be limited as no strong evidence supports their efficacy); to educate patients on diet and lifestyle modifications using education materials and social media during and after the treatment (regular physical activity, drinking enough fluids, regular meal time with food rich in fibers, and regular bowel habit with non-straining defecation); to refer patients to a general/colorectal surgeon when needed; and to teach junior surgeons the best use of surgical techniques. Conclusion: These recommendations can be a step forward toward a recognized guidance for all HCPs in Saudi Arabia for a better management of hemorrhoidal disease.

37,2019,16405552,"Objectives: To evaluate the impact of laxatives on a wide range of symptoms in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids. Methods: We searched using the following sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL, BIOSIS, AMED, Papers First and Proceedings; study authors, industry, and experts in the field. We included all published and unpublished parallel group randomized controlled trials comparing any type of laxative to placebo or no therapy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, retrieved all potentially relevant studies, and extracted data on study population, intervention, prespecified outcomes, and methodology. Results: Seven trials randomized 378 patients to fiber or a nonfiber control. Studies were of moderate quality for most outcomes. Meta-analyses using random effects models suggested that fiber has an apparent beneficial effect. The risk of not improving/persisting symptoms decreased by 47% in the fiber group (RR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.38-0.73) and the risk of bleeding by 50% (RR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.89). Studies with multiple follow-ups, usually at 6 wk and at 3 months, showed consistent results over time. Results are also compatible with large treatment effects in prolapse, pain, and itching, but even in the pooled analyses confidence intervals were wide and compatible with no effect (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.37-1.67; RR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.07-1.65; and RR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.24-2.10, respectively). One study suggested a decrease in recurrence. Results showed a nonsignificant trend toward increases in mild adverse events in the fiber group (RR = 6.0, 95% CI 0.57-64.8).

However, the role and the correct indication of medical treatments are still controversial. Further, the utility of conservative measures are rarely scientifically supported by adequate trials. Areas covered: This narrative review is based on the search and analysis of full papers in English language selected from PubMed in the past 30 years using the following MeSH Editing: hemorrhoids, conservative treatment, medical treatment and hemorrhoids, pregnancy and hemorrhoids, thrombosed hemorrhoids, randomized trials and hemorrhoids, postoperative pain and hemorrhoids. Expert opinion: Early stages (I/II degrees) of this disease could be effectively managed conservatively with several approaches as lifestyle changes, fiber supplement, topical ointments and phlebotonic drugs. The more advanced hemorrhoid stages (III/IV degrees) need some type of surgery, but medical therapy is still useful to minimize anal symptoms as a bridge-to-surgery treatment. Further, post-hemorrhoidectomy pain, hemorrhoidal crisis even in pregnancy could benefit from the adjunct of local and systemic medical treatment.

38,2019,30961554,"Background: Lumbar traction is a traditional treatment modality for chronic low back pain (CLBP) in many countries. However, its effectiveness has not been demonstrated in clinical practice because of the following: (1) the lack of in vivo biomechanical confirmation of the mechanism of lumbar traction that occurs at the lumbar spine; (2) the lack of a precise delivery system for traction force and, subsequently, the lack of reproducibility; and (3) few randomized controlled trials proving its effectiveness and utility. Methods: This study was planned as a preparatory experiment for a randomized clinical trial, and it aimed (1) to examine the biomechanical change at the lumbar area under lumbar traction and confirm its reproducibility and accuracy as a mechanical intervention, and (2) to reconfirm our clinical impression of the immediate effect of lumbar traction. One hundred thirty-three patients with non-specific CLBP were recruited from 28 orthopaedic clinics to undergo a biomechanical experiment and to assess and determine traction conditions for the next clinical trial. We used two types of traction devices, which are commercially available, and incorporated other measuring tools, such as an infrared range-finder and large extension strain gauge. The finite element method was used to analyze the real data of pelvic girdle movement at the lumbar spine level. Self-report assessments with representative two conditions were analyzed according to the qualitative coding method. Results: Thirty-eight participants provided available biomechanical data. We could not measure directly what happened in the body, but we confirmed that the distraction force lineally correlated with the movement of traction unit at the pelvic girdle. After applying vibration force to preloading, the strain gauge showed proportional vibration of the shifting distance without a phase lag qualitatively. FEM simulation provided at least 3.0-mm shifting distance at the lumbar spine under 100 mm of body traction. Ninety-five participants provided a treatment diary and were classified as no pain, improved, unchanged, and worsened. Approximately 83.2% of participants reported a positive response. Conclusion: Lumbar traction can provide a distractive force at the lumbar spine, and patients who experience the application of such force show an immediate response after traction.

38,2019,30237870,"Background: Previous systematic reviews have concluded that lumbar traction is not effective for patients with low back pain (LBP), yet many clinicians continue to assert its clinical effectiveness. Objective: To systematically identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of traction and explore the variability of traction interventions used in each RCT. Method: A literature search started in September 2016 to retrieve systematic reviews and individual RCTs of lumbar traction. The term ""lumbar traction"" and other key words were used in the following databases: Cochrane Registry, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. The retrieved systematic reviews were used to extract individual RCTs. The most current systematic review included RCTs from inception until August 2012. We performed an additional literature search to update this systematic review with newer RCTs published between September 2012 and December 2016. All of the identified RCTs were combined and summarized into a single evidence table. Results: We identified a total of 37 traction RCTs that varied greatly in their method of traction intervention. The RCTs included several types of traction: mechanical (57%), auto-traction (16%), manual (10.8%), gravitational (8.1%) and aquatic (5.4%). There was also great variability in the types of traction force, rhythm, session duration and treatment frequency used in the RCTs. Patient characteristics were a mixture of acute, subacute and chronic LBP; with or without sciatica. Conclusion: There is wide variability in the type of traction, traction parameters and patient characteristics found among the RCTs of lumbar traction. The variability may call into question the conclusion that lumbar traction has little no or value on clinical outcomes. Also, this variability emphasizes the need for targeted delivery methods of traction that match appropriate dosages with specific subgroups of patients with LBP.",Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,0.8194696307182312

38,2019,33785233,"Background: Lumbar traction is a treatment method traditionally used for chronic low back pain (CLBP) in many countries. However, its clinical effectiveness has not been proven in medical practice. The purpose is to conduct a multi-center, crossover, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to prove the efficacy and safety of traction on CLBP patients, using equipment capable of precise traction force control and of reproducibility of the condition based on the previous biomechanical and pre-clinical studies. Methods: Ninety-five patients with non-specific CLBP from 28 clinics and hospitals were randomly assigned to either the intermittent traction with vibration (ITV) first group (A: sequence ITV to ITO) or the intermittent traction only (ITO) first group (B: sequence ITO to ITV); the former was treated with repeated traction and vibration force added to preload. All patients were followed up weekly for 2 periods after study-initiation. The primary outcome measures were disability level including pain and quality of life (based on Japan Low back pain Evaluation Questionnaire; JLEQ), and JLEQ was measured repeatedly. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed model. Results: Comparing to pre-traction data, both traction modes significant improvement except the first intervention of ITO treatment. The differences in JLEQ scores over time showed significant improvements in the treatment to which vibrational force was added in contrast to the conventional traction treatment; Mean difference was significant to compare ITV treatment and ITO treatment (-1.75 (p = 0.001), 95% CI; -2.69 to -0.80). However, neither difference between the two sequences (p = 0.884) nor carryover effect (p = 0.527) was observed. Conclusions: Altogether, the results indicate that lumbar traction was able to improve the pain and functional status immediately in patients with CLBP.

38,2019,12634941,"The literature on the efficacy of traction in the treatment of low back pain (LBP) is conflicting. The aim of this study was to examine its efficacy in this disorder. Forty-two patients with at least 6 weeks of nonspecific LBP were selected. Demographic data were obtained. All patients completed the Oswestry disability index (ODI) to assess disability and the 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) for evaluation of pain. Subjects were randomly assigned into group 1, receiving only standard physical therapy, or group 2, receiving standard physical therapy with conventional lumbar traction. Standard physical therapy consisted of local heat, ultrasound for the lumbar region, and an active exercise program, given for ten sessions in all. The subjects received instruction on correct posture and recommended therapeutic exercises. They were reevaluated at the end of treatment and at 3-month follow-up. The mean outcome measures were global improvement and satisfaction with the therapy, as well as disability by ODI and pain by VAS. There were no group differences in terms of demographic and baseline clinical characteristics. There was a significant reduction in pain intensity and disability at the end of treatment in both groups. There was complete or mild improvement in 47.6% of group 1 and 40% of group 2. The satisfaction rate with both treatments was more than 70% immediately after the therapies. During the 3-month period, the outcome measures except disability remained statistically stable, with no difference amongst groups. Disability was significantly reduced at follow-up in both groups. Of the patients, 51% continued with the recommended exercises and had significantly lower disability scores than those who did not continue with the exercises. Pain and global improvement were also better in this group, but the difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, no specific effect of traction on standard physical therapy was observed in our study group.

38,2019,26110546,"Study design: Cross-sectional survey. Objectives: To examine how many physical therapists use traction, the patients for whom traction is used, the preferred delivery modes/parameters of traction, the supplemental interventions used with traction, and whether professional characteristics influence traction usage. Background: Several systematic reviews and clinical guidelines have questioned the effectiveness of traction for managing low back pain, yet some patients may benefit from lumbar traction. While traction usage among physical therapists in other countries has been described, usage among physical therapists in the United States has not been examined. Methods: We surveyed a random sample of 4000 Orthopaedic Section members of the American Physical Therapy Association. Associations among respondents' professional characteristics and survey responses were explored with chi-square analyses (α = .05). Results: The response rate was 25.5% (n = 1001), and 76.6% (n = 767) of respondents reported using traction. Most (58.4%) of the respondents used traction for patients with signs of nerve root compression, though many (31.4%) did not. Common delivery modes included manual methods (68.3%) and mechanical tables (44.9%), most often supplemental to other interventions (eg, stabilization exercises, postural education). Levels of professional preparation (doctoral/masters level versus bachelors/certificate level) were associated with many variables, as was attainment of an orthopaedic specialist certification. Conclusion: Most of the orthopaedic physical therapists in the United States who responded to our survey reported that they used lumbar traction, though not necessarily consistent with proposed criteria that identify patients most likely to benefit from traction. They used various traction delivery modes/parameters and used traction within comprehensive plans of care incorporating multiple interventions.

38,2019,18824391,"The purpose of this study was to compare trunk muscle activity, spinal decompression force, and trunk flexibility resulting from various protocols of spinal traction. Four experiments explored the effects of (1) sinusoidal, triangular, square, and continuous distraction-force waveforms, (2) 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees of pull angle, (3) superimposed low, medium and high frequency force oscillations, and (4) sham traction. Nineteen healthy subjects volunteered for this study. Surface EMG was recorded during traction and later used in a biomechanical model to estimate spine decompression force. Trunk flexibility was measured before and after each treatment. There were no differences in muscle activity between any of the experimental conditions except the thoracic erector spinae muscle, which had lower EMG during continuous compared to sinusoidal distraction-force waveform (p=0.02). Thoracic and lumbar erector spinae muscles were significantly less active during sham than real traction (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively). The estimated L4-L5 spine compression force was 25N. Trunk flexibility decreased after each experimental session (p=0.01), and there were no differences between sessions.

The mechanism and etiology of CLBP are frequently unclear, and treatment choices vary. Materials and methods: The scientific literature, including expert-generated treatment guidelines, was reviewed and evaluated for data regarding CLBP prevalence and predictors and for evidence of outcomes from pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies. Results: Evidence is inconclusive as to superior treatments for CLBP. Even therapies with literature support, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids administered short term, do not work for every patient, and combination therapies are frequently beneficial. Early intervention with acute pain may stop the progression to chronicity in predisposed patients; however, much acute back pain resolves spontaneously. Predictors of chronicity include continuing poor function, unwillingness to remain active, psychiatric comorbidities, general poor health, and maladaptive coping strategies.

If there is a component of neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia, then a trial of one of the gabapentinoids is appropriate. If these steps are inadequate, then an opioid analgesic may be added.

It is not clear if they are effective, and concerns have been raised about the potential adverse effects involved. Objectives: The aim of this review was to determine if muscle relaxants are effective in the treatment of non-specific low back pain. Search strategy: A computer-assisted search of the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 up to October 2001) and EMBASE (1988 up to October 2001) was carried out. These databases were searched using the algorithm recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. References cited in the identified articles and other relevant literature were screened. Selection criteria: Randomised and/or double-blinded controlled trials, involving patients diagnosed with non-specific low back pain, treated with muscle relaxants as monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutic modalities, were included for review. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently carried out the methodological quality assessment and data extraction of the trials. The analysis comprised not only a quantitative analysis (statistical pooling) but also a qualitative analysis (""best evidence synthesis""). This involved the appraisal of the strength of evidence for various conclusions using a rating system based on the quality and outcomes of the studies included. Evidence was classified as ""strong"", ""moderate"", ""limited"", ""conflicting"" or ""no"" evidence. Main results: Thirty trials met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-three trials (77%) were of high quality, 24 trials (80%) were on acute low back pain. Four trials studied benzodiazepines, 11 non-benzodiazepines and two antispasticity muscle relaxants in comparison with placebo. Results showed that there is strong evidence that any of these muscle relaxants are more effective than placebo for patients with acute LBP on short-term pain relief. The pooled RR for non-benzodiazepines versus placebo after two to four days was 0.80 [95% CI; 0.71 to 0.89] for pain relief and 0.49 [95% CI; 0.25 to 0.95] for global efficacy. Adverse events, however, with a relative risk of 1.50 [95% CI; 1.14 to 1.98] were significantly more prevalent in patients receiving muscle relaxants and especially the central nervous system adverse effects (RR 2.04; 95% CI; 1.23 to 3.37). The various muscle relaxants were found to be similar in performance.

Results: 49 trials were included in the review, of which 31, sampling 6505 participants, were quantitatively analysed. For acute low back pain, very low certainty evidence showed that at two weeks or less non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics were associated with a reduction in pain intensity compared with control (mean difference -7.7, 95% confidence interval-12.1 to-3.3) but not a reduction in disability (-3.3, -7.3 to 0.7). Low and very low certainty evidence showed that non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics might increase the risk of an adverse event (relative risk 1.6, 1.2 to 2.0) and might have little to no effect on acceptability (0.8, 0.6 to 1.1) compared with control for acute low back pain, respectively. The number of trials investigating other muscle relaxants and different durations of low back pain were small and the certainty of evidence was reduced because most trials were at high risk of bias. Conclusions: Considerable uncertainty exists about the clinical efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants. Very low and low certainty evidence shows that non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics might provide small but not clinically important reductions in pain intensity at or before two weeks and might increase the risk of an adverse event in acute low back pain, respectively. Large, high quality, placebo controlled trials are urgently needed to resolve uncertainty.

39,2019,20205483,"Low back pain is one of the most common conditions encountered in clinical practice and medications are the most commonly used type of treatment. In most patients, low back pain is nonspecific, in that the pain cannot be reliably attributed to a specific condition or abnormality in the back. Although a number of medications are available to treat nonspecific low back pain, selecting a therapy can be a challenge because each one is associated with a unique set of benefits and harms. In addition, the evidence supporting the use of different medications varies, and issues such as costs and patient preferences may also affect treatment choices. A guideline published in 2007 from the American Pain Society and the American College of Physicians on diagnosis and treatment of low back pain includes recommendations on the use of medications, based on the quality of supporting evidence and the estimated magnitude of benefits relative to harms. For most patients with low back pain, regardless of the duration of symptoms, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and NSAIDs are first-line options for pain relief. Opioids are more potent analgesics, but are not a first-line option due to their abuse potential. Skeletal muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines can be used as adjunctive medications for acute low back pain, but have a high incidence of sedation. Tricyclic antidepressants may be an option for chronic low back pain, but their effects on pain appear small or uncertain. Nonetheless, depression is common in patients with low back pain and should be treated appropriately. When choosing medications for treatment of low back pain, practice guidelines provide a useful starting point for making decisions, but clinicians should base therapeutic choices on individualized consideration and discussion with patients regarding the potential benefits and risks.",Can muscle relaxants be used to relieve back pain?,muscle relaxants back pain,1.0,Can muscle relaxants be used to relieve back pain?,0.8523889780044556

Research design and methods: A total of 60 people with type 2 diabetes, 30 men and 30 women aged 52.2 +/- 6.32 years, were divided randomly into six groups. Groups 1, 2, and 3 consumed 1, 3, or 6 g of cinnamon daily, respectively, and groups 4, 5, and 6 were given placebo capsules corresponding to the number of capsules consumed for the three levels of cinnamon. The cinnamon was consumed for 40 days followed by a 20-day washout period. Results: After 40 days, all three levels of cinnamon reduced the mean fasting serum glucose (18-29%), triglyceride (23-30%), LDL cholesterol (7-27%), and total cholesterol (12-26%) levels; no significant changes were noted in the placebo groups. Changes in HDL cholesterol were not significant. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that intake of 1, 3, or 6 g of cinnamon per day reduces serum glucose, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol in people with type 2 diabetes and suggest that the inclusion of cinnamon in the diet of people with type 2 diabetes will reduce risk factors associated with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.",Can cinnamon help people with diabetes?,cinnamon diabetes,0.0,Can cinnamon help people with diabetes?,0.9996781349182129

However, there are no studies to date that investigate whether cinnamon supplements are able to aid in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Chinese subjects. We hypothesized cinnamon should be effective in improving blood glucose control in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. To address this hypothesis, we performed a randomized, double-blinded clinical study to analyze the effect of cinnamon extract on glycosylated hemoglobin A(1c) and fasting blood glucose levels in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 66 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited and randomly divided into 3 groups: placebo and low-dose and high-dose supplementation with cinnamon extract at 120 and 360 mg/d, respectively. Patients in all 3 groups took gliclazide during the entire 3 months of the study. Both hemoglobin A(1c) and fasting blood glucose levels were significantly reduced in patients in the low- and high-dose groups, whereas they were not changed in the placebo group. The blood triglyceride levels were also significantly reduced in the low-dose group. The blood levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and liver transaminase remained unchanged in the 3 groups.

The current literature review aims to discuss the evidence of cinnamon administration regarding its hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering effects, summarizing clinical recommendations. Methods: Electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane library, Science Direct and Web of Science were searched with the scientific name of the plant as well as the common name. The search for articles was based on following keywords: ""cinnamon diabetes"", ""cinnamon diabetes type 2"", ""cinnamon and diabetes type 2"", ""Cinnamomum aromaticum"", ""Cinnamomum cassia"", ""Cinnamomum verum"", ""Cinnamomum zeylanicum"". We carried out inclusion criteria between 2003 and 2018 focusing on human studies. Results: Concerning glycemic profile, in individuals with type II diabetes mellitus the fasting blood glucose reduced from 12.9 to 52.2 mg/dL and HbA1c from 0.27 to 0.83%, whereas serum insulin decreased in few studies. Research papers ranged from 6 to 17 weeks in duration. The lipid lowering potential, in turn, is most controversial compared to anti-hyperglycemic potential. Also cinnamon administration has been claimed to reduce fat mass and raise serum antioxidants, but the studies used inaccurate methods. Two species are most investigated, C. cassia/aromaticum, and C.zeylanicum/verum.

Methods: 58 type 2 diabetic patients (25 males and 33 females), aged 54.9 ± 9.8, treated only with hypoglycemic agents and with an HbA1c more than 7% were randomly assigned to receive either 2g of cinnamon or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Results: After intervention, the mean HbA1c was significantly decreased (P 0.005) in the cinnamon group (8.22% to 7.86%) compared with placebo group (8.55% to 8.68%). Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP) were also significantly reduced (P 0.001) after 12 weeks in the cinnamon group (SBP: 132.6 to 129.2 mmHg and DBP: 85.2 to 80.2 mmHg) compared with the placebo group (SBP: 134.5 to 134.9 mmHg and DBP: 86.8 to 86.1 mmHg). A significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) was observed at week 12 compared to baseline in the cinnamon group, however, the changes were not significant when compared to placebo group. There were no significant differences in serum lipid profiles of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL cholesterols neither between nor within the groups. Conclusions: Intake of 2g of cinnamon for 12 weeks significantly reduces the HbA1c, SBP and DBP among poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients.

Alternative and complementary medicines were inserted in health services, especially in primary care, as an attempt to minimize risks and help control diseases such as diabetes. Among the herbal medicines used stands out cinnamon, which can serve as an adjuvant in the control of diabetes. Objective: To analyze the effectiveness of 3 grams of cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) per day for 90 days in reducing glycemic and lipid levels in adults with T2DM compared with placebo METHODS:: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial, which will be conducted at basic health units in the city of Parnaíba, state of Piauí, Brazil. In total, 130 people diagnosed with T2DM, followed at health units, with hemoglobin A1c &gt; 6.5%, and using oral antidiabetic medicines, are expected to participate in the study. The intervention will last for 3 months, and each participant will receive a total of 3 bottles containing 120 capsules in each bottle of cinnamon or placebo. Each person should take 4 capsules daily, for 90 days. The patients will be distributed into the 2 groups by performing block randomization (n = 6) at a ratio of 1:1 according to a code generated by a software. Assessments of socioeconomic, clinical, lifestyle, anthropometric, and laboratory variables will be performed in 2 separate visits. Discussion: This study will be the first to investigate cinnamon to reduce glycemic, lipid, and anthropometric levels in Brazil.

41,2019,26556055,"Background: High-dose benzodiazepine (BZD) dependence is associated with a wide variety of negative health consequences. Affected individuals are reported to suffer from severe mental disorders and are often unable to achieve long-term abstinence via recommended discontinuation strategies. Although it is increasingly understood that treatment interventions should take subjective experiences and beliefs into account, the perceptions of this group of individuals remain under-investigated. Methods: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 41 adult subjects meeting criteria for (high-dose) BZD-dependence, as defined by ICD-10. One-on-one in-depth interviews allowed for an exploration of this group's views on the reasons behind their initial and then continued use of BZDs, as well as their procurement strategies. Mayring's qualitative content analysis was used to evaluate our data. Results: In this sample, all participants had developed explanatory models for why they began using BZDs. We identified a multitude of reasons that we grouped into four broad categories, as explaining continued BZD use: (1) to cope with symptoms of psychological distress or mental disorder other than substance use, (2) to manage symptoms of physical or psychological discomfort associated with somatic disorder, (3) to alleviate symptoms of substance-related disorders, and (4) for recreational purposes, that is, sensation-seeking and other social reasons. Subjects often considered BZDs less dangerous than other substances and associated their use more often with harm reduction than as recreational. Specific obtainment strategies varied widely: the majority of participants oscillated between legal and illegal methods, often relying on the black market when faced with treatment termination. Conclusions: Irrespective of comorbidity, participants expressed a clear preference for medically related explanatory models for their BZD use. We therefore suggest that clinicians consider patients' motives for long-term, high-dose BZD use when formulating treatment plans for this patient group, especially since it is known that individuals are more compliant with approaches they perceive to be manageable, tolerable, and effective.",Can benzos (benzodiazepines) help with alcohol withdrawal?,benzos alcohol withdrawal,1.0,Can benzos (benzodiazepines) help with alcohol withdrawal?,0.8170033693313599

In American literature the severity of withdrawal is recorded using the CIWA-A scale (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment--Alcohol). The pathophysiological causes lie in an imbalance between the inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters after giving up alcohol. This results in predomination by the excitatory system. Therapeutic intervention is possible here. Clomethiazole has effective sedative actions, stabilises the autonomic nervous system, and is an anticonvulsant. It is the drug of choice for autonomic withdrawal and predelirium. The benzodlazepines have a similar effect, but cannot be controlled so accurately. Carbamazepine can prevent withdrawal convulsions and progression of delirium.

41,2019,18188105,"Background: Although benzodiazepines are the recommended first-line therapy for the prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), the administration of intravenous ethanol as an alternative prophylactic agent persists in many surgical ICUs. Advocates of this therapy argue that ethanol provides effective prophylaxis against AWS without the excessive sedation observed with benzodiazepine therapy. No study to date, however, has compared the two therapies with regard to their sedative effects. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of intravenous ethanol compared with benzodiazepines for the prevention of AWS with particular emphasis on the sedative effects of each therapy. Methods: During a 15-month period, trauma patients admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic daily alcohol consumption greater than or equal to five beverage equivalents per day were prospectively randomized to one of two 4-day prophylactic regimens: intravenous ethanol infusion (EtOH) versus scheduled-dose diazepam (BENZO). Patients were evaluated with the Riker sedation-agitation scale, a 7-point instrument for the subjective assessment of both sedation (1 = unarousable) and agitation (7 = dangerous agitation). According to protocol, regimens were titrated to achieve and maintain a Riker score of 4 (calm and cooperative). Deviation from a score of 4 during the course of treatment was compared between groups. Results: Fifty patients met study criteria and were randomized after obtainment of informed consent (EtOH, n = 26; BENZO, n = 24). Overall, the EtOH group had a significantly greater proportion of patients who deviated from a score of 4 during the course of treatment (p = 0.020). In both groups, the majority of deviation from a score of 4 reflected periods of under-sedation rather than over-sedation. One patient in the EtOH group failed treatment, requiring diazepam and haloperidol for control of AWS symptoms as per protocol, whereas no patient in the BENZO group failed treatment (p = NS). Conclusion: Concerning the prophylaxis of AWS, intravenous ethanol offers no advantage over diazepam with respect to efficacy or adverse sedative effects.

Meta-analysis of data from seven trials showed no significant difference in investigator rated eczema severity between probiotic and placebo treatments. Subgroup analysis by eczema severity or presence of atopy did not identify a specific population in which probiotic treatment was effective. There was significant heterogeneity between studies; however, the results of three studies that used the same probiotic strain were concordant. The adverse events search identified case reports of sepsis and bowel ischaemia caused by probiotics. Conclusions: Currently, probiotics cannot be recommended for treating eczema.

42,2019,30480774,"Background: Eczema is a common chronic skin condition. Probiotics have been proposed as an effective treatment for eczema; their use is increasing, as numerous clinical trials are under way. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2008, which suggested that probiotics may not be an effective treatment for eczema but identified areas in which evidence was lacking. Objectives: To assess the effects of probiotics for treating patients of all ages with eczema. Search methods: We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, the Global Resource of Eczema Trials (GREAT) database, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also handsearched a number of conference proceedings. We updated the searches of the main databases in January 2018 and of trials registries in March 2018, but we have not yet incorporated these results into the review. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of probiotics (live orally ingested micro-organisms) compared with no treatment, placebo, or other active intervention with no probiotics for the treatment of eczema diagnosed by a doctor. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. We recorded adverse events from the included studies and from a separate adverse events search conducted for the first review. We formally assessed reporting bias by preparing funnel plots, and we performed trial sequential analysis for the first primary outcome - eczema symptoms at the end of active treatment.We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome (in italic font). Main results: We included 39 randomised controlled trials involving 2599 randomised participants. We included participants of either gender, aged from the first year of life through to 55 years (only six studies assessed adults), who had mild to severe eczema. Trials were undertaken in primary and secondary healthcare settings, mainly in Europe or Asia. Duration of treatment ranged from four weeks to six months, and duration of follow-up after end of treatment ranged from zero to 36 months. We selected no standard dose: researchers used a variety of doses and concentrations of probiotics. The probiotics used were bacteria of the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria species, which were taken alone or combined with other probiotics, and were given with or without prebiotics. Comparators were no treatment, placebo, and other treatments with no probiotics.For all results described in this abstract, the comparator was no probiotics. Active treatment ranged from six weeks to three months for all of the following results, apart from the investigator-rated eczema severity outcome, for which the upper limit of active treatment was 16 weeks. With regard to score, the higher the score, the more severe were the symptoms. All key results reported in this abstract were measured at the end of active treatment, except for adverse events, which were measured during the active treatment period.Probiotics probably make little or no difference in participant- or parent-rated symptoms of eczema (13 trials; 754 participants): symptom severity on a scale from 0 to 20 was 0.44 points lower after probiotic treatment (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.22 to 0.33; moderate-quality evidence). Trial sequential analysis shows that target sample sizes of 258 and 456, which are necessary to demonstrate a minimum mean difference of -2 and -1.5, respectively, with 90% power, have been exceeded, suggesting that further trials with similar probiotic strains for this outcome at the end of active treatment may be futile.We found no evidence suggesting that probiotics make a difference in QoL for patients with eczema (six studies; 552 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.03, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.42; low-quality evidence) when measured by the participant or the parent using validated disease-specific QoL instruments.Probiotics may slightly reduce investigator-rated eczema severity scores (24 trials; 1596 participants). On a scale of 0 to 103 for total Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), a score combining investigator-rated eczema severity score and participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss was 3.91 points lower after probiotic treatment than after no probiotic treatment (95% CI -5.86 to -1.96; low-quality evidence). The minimum clinically important difference for SCORAD has been estimated to be 8.7 points.We noted significant to extreme levels of unexplainable heterogeneity between the results of individual studies. We judged most studies to be at unclear risk of bias; six studies had high attrition bias, and nine were at low risk of bias overall.We found no evidence to show that probiotics make a difference in the risk of adverse events during active treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.63; seven trials; 402 participants; low-quality evidence). Studies in our review that reported adverse effects described gastrointestinal symptoms. Authors' conclusions: Evidence suggests that, compared with no probiotic, currently available probiotic strains probably make little or no difference in improving patient-rated eczema symptoms. Probiotics may make little or no difference in QoL for people with eczema nor in investigator-rated eczema severity score (combined with participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss); for the latter, the observed effect was small and of uncertain clinical significance. Therefore, use of probiotics for the treatment of eczema is currently not evidence-based. This update found no evidence of increased adverse effects with probiotic use during studies, but a separate adverse events search from the first review revealed that probiotic treatment carries a small risk of adverse events.Results show significant, unexplainable heterogeneity between individual trial results. Only a small number of studies measured some outcomes.Future studies should better measure QoL scores and adverse events, and should report on new probiotics. Researchers should also consider studying subgroups of patients (e.g. patients with atopy or food allergies, adults) and standardising doses/concentrations of probiotics given.",Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,0.23682203888893127
42,2019,18843705,"Background: Probiotics have been proposed as an effective treatment for eczema, and recently a number of clinical trials have been undertaken. Objectives: To assess the effects of probiotics for the treatment of eczema Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (to April 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2,2008) MEDLINE (from 2003 to April 2008), EMBASE (from 2005 to April 2008), PsycINFO, AMED and LILACS (from inception to April 2008) and ISI Web of Science (to December 2006) and reference lists of articles. We also searched registries of ongoing clinical trials, conference proceedings and searched for adverse events. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of live orally ingested microorganisms for the treatment of eczema. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently applied eligibility criteria, assessed the quality of trials and extracted data. We contacted study authors for more information where necessary. We recorded adverse events from the included studies, and from the separate adverse events search. Main results: Twelve randomised controlled trials involving 781 participants met the inclusion criteria. All trial participants were children. There was no significant difference in participant or parent-rated symptom scores in favour of probiotic treatment (5 trials, 313 participants). Symptom severity on a scale from 0 to 20 was 0.90 points lower after probiotic treatment than after placebo (95%CI -1.04, 2.84; p = 0.36).There was also no significant difference in participant or parent-rated overall eczema severity in favour of probiotic treatment (3 trials, 150 participants). There was no significant difference in investigator rated eczema severity between probiotic and placebo treatments (7 trials, 588 participants). On a scale from 0 to 102 investigator rated eczema severity was 2.46 points lower after probiotic treatment than after placebo treatment (95%CI -2.53, 7.45 p = 0.33). Significant heterogeneity was noted between the results of individual studies, which may be explained by the use of different probiotic strains. Subgroup analysis by age of participant, severity of eczema, presence of atopy or presence of food allergy did not identify a population with different treatment outcomes to the population as a whole. The adverse events search identified some case reports of infections and bowel ischaemia caused by probiotics. Authors' conclusions: The evidence suggests that probiotics are not an effective treatment for eczema, and probiotic treatment carries a small risk of adverse events.",Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,0.1514044553041458
42,2019,19874342,"This review summarizes clinically important findings from systematic reviews indexed in bibliographical databases between August 2007 and August 2008 that dealt with disease prevention (six reviews) and treatment of atopic eczema (seven reviews). Regarding disease prevention, two independent systematic reviews found some clinical trial evidence that ingestion of probiotics by mothers during pregnancy might reduce the incidence of subsequent eczema. Another review failed to find any clear benefit of prebiotics in eczema prevention. Although furry pets are often cited as causing allergic disease, a systematic review of observational studies found no evidence that exposure to cats or dogs at birth increases eczema risk. One very large review of studies of breastfeeding found some evidence of a protective effect on eczema risk, although all the studies were limited by their observational nature. A German group has attempted an overview of eczema prevention studies with a view to informing national guidelines. In terms of eczema treatment, two systematic reviews have confirmed the efficacy of topical tacrolimus ointment. Another review of 31 trials confirms the efficacy of topical pimecrolimus, although many of those trials were vehicle controlled, which limits their clinical utility. A review of 23 studies of desensitization therapy for allergic diseases found some evidence of benefit for eczema, which needs to be explored further. Despite the popularity of antistaphylococcal therapies for eczema, a Cochrane Review of 21 trials failed to show any clear benefit for any of the therapies for infected or clinically noninfected eczema. Another Cochrane Review dealt with dietary exclusions for people with eczema and found little evidence to support any dietary exclusion, apart from avoidance of eggs in infants with suspected egg allergy supported by evidence of sensitization. A review of 13 studies of probiotics for treating established eczema did not show convincing evidence of a clinically worthwhile benefit, an observation that has been substantiated in a subsequent Cochrane Review.",Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,0.4694593846797943
42,2019,20649899,"This review summarizes clinically important findings from nine systematic reviews of the causes, treatment and prevention of atopic eczema (AE) published between August 2008 and August 2009. Two systematic reviews concluded that there is a strong and consistent association between filaggrin (FLG) mutations and development of eczema. The associations between FLG mutations and atopic sensitization, rhinitis and asthma are weaker than between FLG mutations and eczema, especially if those who also have eczema are excluded. The relationship between transforming growth factor levels in breast milk and eczema development is still unclear. A further systematic review found no strong evidence of a protective effect of exclusive breastfeeding for at least 3 months against eczema, even in those with a positive family history of atopy. Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials, supplementation with omega-3 and omega-6 oils is unlikely to play an important role in the primary prevention of eczema or allergic diseases in general. There is little evidence to support dietary restrictions of certain foods in unselected children with AE. There is also little evidence to suggest a clinically useful benefit from using probiotics in patients with established eczema. A systematic review of topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus added little additional information to previous reviews, and did not provide any new data on long-term safety. Both of these drugs work in AE, and may reduce flares and usage of topical corticosteroids; however, there is still uncertainty about how they compare with topical corticosteroids.",Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,0.00015766924479976296
42,2019,18163227,"Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that has reached nearly epidemic proportions in childhood. Moreover, it is a difficult disease to control and, with its onset in childhood, is often the first manifestation of atopy. The clinical features of eczema include itchy red skin accompanied by dryness and lichenification. In the past, treatment options consisted primarily of avoidance of soap and water. These options have considerably improved with both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches. However, eczema is still a treatment challenge. Part of the problem in developing new treatment options has been the relative failure in translating basic science information into clinical application.

42,2019,26136864,"The aim of the present study was to provide evidence for the application of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of infantile eczema by exploring changes in the intestinal Bifidobacteria levels and the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index prior and subsequent to treatment with probiotics in infants with eczema. A total of 40 infants with eczema were randomly divided into treatment and control groups. Prior and subsequent to the treatment, the SCORAD index was evaluated and the content of Bifidobacterium bifidum in the stool of each infant in the two groups was quantified using 16S rRNA/DNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. After four weeks of treatment with B. bifidum triple viable capsules, the levels of B. bifidum increased sharply (P 0.05) and the SCORAD index was notably reduced (P 0.05) as compared with the values prior to treatment. By contrast, neither the content of B. bifidum nor the SCORAD index changed significantly in the control group after four weeks (P&gt;0.05). Following treatment, the levels of B. bifidum in the stools of the treatment group were significantly higher than those in the stools of the control group (P 0.05), and the SCORAD index was significantly lower than that of the control group (P 0.05).

42,2019,16650040,"Probiotics have recently been advocated for the prevention and treatment of allergic disease (AD). In clinical practice they are increasingly being used for these purposes. Here we review the evidence base for the use of probiotics in the management of AD. We find support for their use in the treatment of childhood eczema, but the clinical significance of any treatment effect is uncertain. There is also evidence to support the use of probiotics in the prevention of childhood eczema. However the available evidence suggests that probiotics are not an effective treatment for allergic airway diseases. Probiotics may be more effective when used early in life, and they may have a particular role in gastrointestinal AD. The relative efficacy of different probiotic strains in the management of AD is not well established, and further work is needed to establish their mechanisms of action. In summary probiotics are likely to play a part in the management of childhood eczema in the future, and further studies are warranted to precisely define their role.",Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,0.7366119027137756
42,2019,23640127,"Probiotics and prebiotics have a major influence on gastrointestinal flora composition. This review analyses the relationship between this change in flora composition and health benefits in children. Literature databases were searched for relevant articles. Despite exhaustive research on the subject in different indications, such as prevention and treatment of acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD), traveler's diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Helicobacter pylori, necrotizing enterocolitis, constipation, allergy and atopic dermatitis, colic and extraintestinal infections, reports of clear benefits for the use of prebiotics and probiotics in pediatric disorders remain scarce. The best evidence has been provided for the use of probiotics in acute gastroenteritis and in prevention of AAD. However, AAD in children is in general mild, and only seldom necessitates additional interventions. Overall, the duration of acute infectious diarrhea is reduced by approximately 24 hours. Evidence for clinically relevant benefit in all other indications (inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, allergy) is weak to nonexistent. Selected probiotic strains given during late pregnancy and early infancy decrease atopic dermatitis. Adverse effects have very seldom been reported. Since the risk seems minimal to nonexistent, prebiotics and probiotics may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of some disorders in children, although the evidence for benefit is limited. The best evidence has been accumulated for some lactobacilli strains and for Saccharomyces boulardii in the reduction of the duration of acute diarrhea due to gastroenteritis and prevention of AAD.",Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,0.799314558506012
42,2019,23282383,"Background: : Probiotic administration has been proposed for the prevention and treatment of specific allergic manifestations such as eczema, rhinitis, gastrointestinal allergy, food allergy, and asthma. However, published statements and scientific opinions disagree about the clinical usefulness. Objective: : A World Allergy Organization Special Committee on Food Allergy and Nutrition review of the evidence regarding the use of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of allergy. Methods: : A qualitative and narrative review of the literature on probiotic treatment of allergic disease was carried out to address the diversity and variable quality of relevant studies. This variability precluded systematization, and an expert panel group discussion method was used to evaluate the literature. In the absence of systematic reviews of treatment, meta-analyses of prevention studies were used to provide data in support of probiotic applications. Results: : Despite the plethora of literature, probiotic research is still in its infancy. There is a need for basic microbiology research on the resident human microbiota. Mechanistic studies from biology, immunology, and genetics are needed before we can claim to harness the potential of immune modulatory effects of microbiota. Meanwhile, clinicians must take a step back and try to link disease state with alterations of the microbiota through well-controlled long-term studies to identify clinical indications. Conclusions: : Probiotics do not have an established role in the prevention or treatment of allergy. No single probiotic supplement or class of supplements has been demonstrated to efficiently influence the course of any allergic manifestation or long-term disease or to be sufficient to do so. Further epidemiologic, immunologic, microbiologic, genetic, and clinical studies are necessary to determine whether probiotic supplements will be useful in preventing allergy. Until then, supplementation with probiotics remains empirical in allergy medicine. In the future, basic research should focus on homoeostatic studies, and clinical research should focus on preventive medicine applications, not only in allergy. Collaborations between allergo-immunologists and microbiologists in basic research and a multidisciplinary approach in clinical research are likely to be the most fruitful.",Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,0.6671187877655029

44,2019,15846704,"Background: Vitamins have been reported to be effective in controlling certain types of seizures and to prevent some of the harmful effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In this review we will summarize evidence from randomized controlled trials. Objectives: To assess if vitamins improve seizure control, reduce adverse effects of AEDs or improve the quality of life in people with epilepsy. Search strategy: We searched MEDLINE from 1966 to 2004, the Cochrane Epilepsy Group trials register (December 2004), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register) (TheCochraneLibrary Issue 4, 2004), and cross-references from identified studies. Selection criteria: Randomized or quasi-randomized studies investigating the effects of one or more vitamins given alone or in addition to AEDs to people of any age with any type of epilepsy. Data collection and analysis: Both reviewers assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted the data. Outcomes assessed included seizure frequency, gingival hyperplasia, neuropathy, changes in bone mineral content, serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, hemogram, serum levels of AEDs, neuropsychological and quality of life outcomes. Primary analyses were by intention to treat. Main results: Fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria and were of poor methodological quality. None described randomization methods and most enrolled small numbers of participants. Nine studies (331 participants) investigated folic acid. Two studies (75 participants) found no effect for the outcome 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.32 to 2.29). Also, no evidence was found for an effect on gingival health, intelligence, behavior, mental health or personality, or measures of red blood volume and hemoglobin content. Folic acid was not associated with any consistent changes in serum phenytoin or phenobarbitone levels or improvement in the mean motor conduction velocities of peripheral nerves. One small study (72 participants) found that thiamine improves neuropsychological functions related to psychomotor speed, visuospatial abilities, selective attention and verbal abstracting ability. One study (226 participants) found a significantly higher bone mineral content (BMC) among patients with epilepsy taking AEDs with vitamin D supplementation compared to controls who were not given supplementation (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.48 to 4.72; p 0.00001). The studies found no significant effects on serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase or general well-being. One small study (24 participants) found a significant decrease in seizure frequency in those treated with vitamin E compared to placebo (p = 0.00005; Peto OR 26.73; 95% CI 5.46 to 130.92). Authors' conclusions: In view of methodological deficiencies and limited number of individual studies, we have found no reliable evidence to support the routine use of vitamins in patients with epilepsy.

44,2019,28770947,"Objective: To study the clinical value of anti-epileptic drugs combined with B vitamins in the treatment of epilepsy after stroke. Patients and methods: The study included 90 consecutive patients with epilepsy after stroke. Patients were randomly divided into groups of 30 each according to treatment: single-agent or combination anti-epileptic therapy with oxcarbazepine and sodium valproate (control group), anti-epileptic therapy with compound vitamin B tablets (observation group 1), and anti-epileptic therapy with vitamin B12 (mecobalamin) (observation group 2). After 12 months, treatment effects were assessed and compared among groups. Results: Compared with the control group, observation group 2 had better epilepsy control and observation group 1 had no difference in efficacy. New-onset stroke was seen in three cases (10%) of the control group and in two cases (6.7%) of observation group 1. This was not seen in observation group 2. In the control group and observation group 1, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score significantly decreased after 6 months, but increased again at 12 months. Conversely, NIHSS score continuously decreased during follow-up in observation group 2. The plasma level of asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) gradually increased in the control group and observation group 1, but remained unchanged in observational group 2. The differences in NIHSS scores and plasma ADMA levels between the control and observation groups were statistically significant. Conclusions: Anti-epilepsy drugs combined with B vitamins can improve epilepsy control after stroke and reduce new stroke occurrence. This effect may be associated with stability of plasma ADMA levels. Vitamin B12 may be better than vitamin B complex in the treatment of epilepsy after stroke.",Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,vitamins epilepsy,0.0,Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,0.9537193179130554
44,2019,19777382,"The regulation of programmed cell death in the nervous system of vertebrates is a complex mechanism aimed to remove superfluous or damaged cells. Epileptic seizures can lead to an activation of pathways resulting in neuronal cell death. B-vitamins might have a neuroprotective potential reducing cell death following appropriate stimulation. Here, the role of the B-vitamins B(1) (thiamine), B(6) (pyridoxine), and B(12) (cobalamine) was investigated in a mouse model of experimental epilepsy induced by kainate. B-vitamin pre-treated animals showed a significantly reduced epileptic score during the first 15 min after kainate injection. The molecular response to kainate showed a bi-phased time course with early induction of Bcl-2 expression within 12 h and a second induction after 7 days of kainate exposure. B-vitamin pre-treatment resulted in significant higher Bcl-2 expression in control animals (no kainate) and at 12 h within the early phase. Bcl-2 expression was not affected by B-vitamins within the second phase. BAX expression was not significantly influenced during the whole experiment. Three days after kainate stimulation, the number of TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cells in the hippocampal region was lower in B-vitamin-treated animals.

However, there is a need to find an efficient treatment regimen that includes ASC and low-intensity exercise to diminish the risk of overtraining and nutritional treatment by attenuating oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated the combined effect of low-intensity physical exercise (EX) and ASC on kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure activity and oxidative stress in mice. The mice were randomly assigned into groups as follows: ""KA only"" (n = 11), ""ASC + KA"" (n = 11), ""Ex + KA"" (n = 11), ""ASC + Ex + KA"" (n = 11). In the present study, low intensity of swimming training period lasted 8 weeks and consisted of 30-min sessions daily (three times per week) without tail weighting. Although no preventive effect of low-intensity exercise or ASC on KA seizure occurrence was evident, there was a decrease of seizure activity, seizure development (latency to first seizures), and mortality in ""ASC + Ex + KA"" compared to ""ASC + KA"", ""Ex + KA"", and ""KA only"" group. In addition, a preventive synergistic coordination of low-intensity exercise and ASC was evident in glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activity compared to separate treatment. These results suggest that low-intensity exercise and ASC treatment have preventive effects on seizure activity and development with alternation of oxidative status.",Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,vitamins epilepsy,0.0,Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,0.9854517579078674

Some diets have been shown to have a positive impact upon the seizure activity in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy (IE), while other diets and dietary supplements (DS), although marketed as providing health benefits, lack conclusive scientific evidence on their actual beneficial effects. A web-based owner questionnaire was designed to assess how and why owners of dogs with IE use different dietary regimes and DS. The study cohort, with 297 valid responses, consisted mainly of pure-breed (82.5%) male neutered (52.9%) dogs. Over two-thirds of owners (67.7%) changed their dog's diet after their dog received a diagnosis of IE. Nearly half of the owners (45.8%) reported giving DS, the most common being coconut oil or derived medium-chain triglyceride oil (71.3%). Some owner justifications of DS use included improvement of seizure frequency (88.2%), seizure severity (61.8%) and protection from potential drug side effects (62.5%). Many owners give DS to their dog with IE. The pharmacokinetic properties of anti-epileptic drugs, such as efficacy, absorption and clearance can be influenced by other medications, diets and possibly by DS.

Methods: MEDLINE and Scopus from inception to August 25, 2020 were searched for related published manuscripts. The search keywords included ""vitamin or folate or folic acid or biotin or thiamine or carnitine or zinc or manganese or selenium or omega-3 fatty acid or linoleic acid or micronutrient or trace element or supplementation"" AND ""epilepsy or seizure"". Results: We could identify 26 related articles. Seventeen studies provided class 2 of evidence and the rest provided class 3 of evidence. Eight studies investigated polyunsaturated fats, seven groups studied folic acid, four studies explored the effects of vitamin D, two investigated vitamin E, and three others studied multivitamin cocktails. There was one study on zinc and one on selenium. There is some evidence on the efficacy of polyunsaturated fats in treating seizures in PWE. The evidence on the efficacy of multivitamin cocktails in adults is promising. Conclusion: High quality data on the efficacy of nutritional (vitamins-minerals) supplementations in treating seizures in PWE is scarce; however, designing future clinical trials of polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for drug-resistant seizures in adults with focal epilepsy and in children, and also multivitamin supplementations in adults with focal epilepsy seems reasonable and promising.

45,2019,20091514,"Background: Caffeine has a variety of pharmacological effects; it is a weak bronchodilator and it also reduces respiratory muscle fatigue. It is chemically related to the drug theophylline which is used to treat asthma. It has been suggested that caffeine may reduce asthma symptoms and interest has been expressed in its potential role as an asthma treatment. A number of studies have explored the effects of caffeine in asthma, this is the first review to systematically examine and summarise the evidence. Objectives: To assess the effects of caffeine on lung function and identify whether there is a need to control for caffeine consumption prior to either lung function or exhaled nitric oxide testing. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and the reference lists of articles (August 2009). We also contacted study authors. Selection criteria: Randomised clinical trials of oral caffeine compared to placebo or coffee compared to decaffeinated coffee in adults with asthma. Data collection and analysis: Trial selection, quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers. Main results: Seven trials involving a total of 75 people with mild to moderate asthma were included. The studies were all of cross-over design .Six trials involving 55 people showed that in comparison with placebo, caffeine, even at a 'low dose' ( 5mg/kg body weight), appears to improve lung function for up to two hours after consumption. Forced expiratory volume in one minute showed a small improvement up to two hours after caffeine ingestion (SMD 0.72; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.20), which translates into a 5% mean difference in FEV1. However in two studies the mean differences in FEV1 were 12% and 18% after caffeine. Mid-expiratory flow rates also showed a small improvement with caffeine and this was sustained up to four hours.One trial involving 20 people examined the effect of drinking coffee versus a decaffeinated variety on the exhaled nitric oxide levels in patients with asthma and concluded that there was no significant effect on this outcome. Authors' conclusions: Caffeine appears to improve airways function modestly, for up to four hours, in people with asthma . People may need to avoid caffeine for at least four hours prior to lung function testing, as caffeine ingestion could cause misinterpretation of the results. Drinking caffeinated coffee before taking exhaled nitric oxide measurements does not appear to affect the results of the test, but more studies are needed to confirm this.",Can caffeine help people with asthma?,caffeine asthma,1.0,Can caffeine help people with asthma?,0.25999748706817627
45,2019,11687099,"Background: Caffeine has a variety of pharmacological effects. It is chemically related to the drug theophylline which is used to treat asthma. Accordingly, interest has been expressed in its potential role as an asthma treatment. A number of studies have explored the effects of caffeine in asthma, this is the first review to systematically examine and summarise the evidence. Objectives: Caffeine is a weak bronchodilator and it also reduces respiratory muscle fatigue. It has been suggested that caffeine may reduce asthma symptoms. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of caffeine on lung function and identify whether there is a need to control for caffeine consumption prior to lung function testing. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and the reference lists of articles. We also contacted study authors. Selection criteria: Randomised trials of oral caffeine compared to placebo in adults with asthma. Data collection and analysis: Trial quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers. Main results: Six trials involving a total of 55 people were included. The studies were all of cross-over design and of high quality. In comparison with placebo, caffeine appears to improve lung function for up to two hours after consumption. Forced expiratory volume in one minute showed a small improvement up to two hours after caffeine use (standardised mean difference -0.73, 95% confidence interval -1.20 to -0.25). Mid-expiratory flow rates also showed a small improvement with caffeine and this was sustained up to four hours. An updated search in June 2001 did not identify any further studies. Reviewer's conclusions: Caffeine appears to improve airways function modestly in people with asthma for up to four hours. People may need to avoid caffeine for at least four hours prior to lung function testing.",Can caffeine help people with asthma?,caffeine asthma,1.0,Can caffeine help people with asthma?,0.46200138330459595
45,2019,2205947,"It was recently reported that caffeine may reduce the clinical symptoms of asthma and may prevent the clinical manifestations of this disease. The effect of caffeine on histamine responsiveness is unknown. The effect of caffeine (5 mg/kg) and placebo on histamine responsiveness (the provocation concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1, PC20) was studied in 10 subjects with mild asthma (prechallenge FEV1 84% of predicted value). The PC20 for histamine bronchoprovocation after caffeine ingestion was 2.65 (95% confidence limits 0.99, 7.10) mg/ml. After placebo the PC20 was 1.89 (0.96, 3.71) mg/ml. It is concluded that caffeine in a dose equivalent to about three cups of coffee has a very small effect, if any, on histamine bronchoprovocation in those with mild asthma.

45,2019,31777565,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airways disease, estimated to affect 300 million people worldwide. Asthma management plans focus on optimisation of asthma pharmacotherapy. Lifestyle interventions also hold great promise for asthma sufferers as they are accessible, low cost and have minimal side-effects, thus making adherence more likely. This review explores lifestyle interventions that have been tested in asthma, including improving nutrition, increasing physical activity and introduction of relaxation therapies such as yoga and massage therapy. Available evidence suggests a protective effect of increasing fruit, vegetable and wholegrain intake and increasing physical activity levels in asthma. Weight loss is recommended for obese asthmatic patients, as just 5-10% weight loss has been found to improve quality of life and asthma control in most obese asthmatic patients. Other lifestyle interventions such as meditation, yoga and massage therapy show promise, with positive effects on asthma seen in some studies. However, the study protocols are highly variable and the results are inconsistent. Additional research is needed to further develop and refine recommendations regarding lifestyle modifications that can be implemented to improve asthma. Key points: Improving diet quality, by increasing fruit, vegetable and wholegrain intake and reducing saturated fat intake, should be recommended in asthma, as there is evidence suggesting that this leads to improvements in airway inflammation, asthma control and exacerbation risk.Regular physical activity should be promoted for people with asthma, as it can improve quality of life and lung function, as well as general health.In obese asthmatic patients, weight loss should be recommended, as it leads to numerous health benefits, including improvements in asthma. Even small amounts of weight loss in adults (5-10% body weight) have been shown to improve asthma quality of life and asthma control in the majority of people with asthma.There is some evidence of benefit of meditation, yoga and breathing exercises for adults with asthma, while massage therapy shows promise in children with asthma. However, the evidence is inconsistent and more research is needed to make definitive recommendations. Educational aims: To summarise current knowledge on lifestyle interventions in asthma.To improve awareness of how lifestyle modification can be used in asthma management.To identify areas for future research on lifestyle interventions in asthma.",Can caffeine help people with asthma?,caffeine asthma,1.0,Can caffeine help people with asthma?,0.6447136998176575
45,2019,32946870,"COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for treatment. Despite multiple clinical trials using different agents, there is still a lack of specific treatment for COVID-19. Having the potential role in suppressing inflammation, immune modulation, antiviral and improving respiratory symptoms, this review discusses the potential role of methylxanthine drugs like pentoxifylline and caffeine in the management of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 pathogenesis for clinical features like severe pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) / acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failures are excessive inflammation, oxidation, and cytokine storm by the exaggerated immune response. Drugs like pentoxifylline have already shown improvement of the symptoms of ARDS and caffeine has been in clinical use for decades to treat apnea of prematurity (AOP) in preterm infants and improve respiratory function. Pentoxifylline is well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecules that have already shown to suppress Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α) as well as other inflammatory cytokines in pulmonary diseases, and this may be beneficial for better clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Pentoxifylline enhances blood flow, improves microcirculation and tissue oxygenation, and caffeine also efficiently improves tissue oxygenation, asthma, decreases pulmonary hypertension and an effective analgesic. There are significant shreds of evidence that proved the properties of pentoxifylline and caffeine against virus-related diseases as well. Along with the aforementioned evidences and high safety profiles, both pentoxifylline and caffeine offer a glimpse of considerations for future use as a potential adjuvant to COVID-19 treatment. However, additional clinical studies are required to confirm this speculation.",Can caffeine help people with asthma?,caffeine asthma,1.0,Can caffeine help people with asthma?,0.9869935512542725
45,2019,21726992,"Background: The bronchoprotective effect of caffeine on histamine challenge testing (HCT) has been studied with equivocal results. Current guidelines for bronchoprovocation testing recommend exclusion of caffeine the day of testing. The effects of caffeine on methacholine challenge testing (MCT), now more commonly performed than histamine challenge, are unknown. Methods: Sixteen well-controlled asthmatics with a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) &gt; 65% predicted and methacholine provocation concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)) ≤ 16 mg/ml participated in a randomized single-blind crossover study. The two treatments included 16 ounces of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee given on two separate days. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and FEV(1) were measured before and 1 h after each treatment. One hour post treatment blood was drawn for serum caffeine level and the MCT was done. Results: Fourteen subjects completed the study; there were no adverse events. No significant bronchodilation was seen between the mean FEV(1) values before and after the caffeinated treatment (3.31 ± 0.75 L and 3.36 ± 0.74 L, respectively). No significant bronchoprotection was seen between the caffeinated and decaffeinated treatment's geometric mean PC(20) values (1.35 mg/ml and 1.36 mg/ml, respectively). Mean eNO values before and after caffeinated treatment were not significantly different (31.2 ± 19.6 ppb and 31.5 ± 20.4 ppb). Conclusion: The amount of caffeine in a normal dietary serving of a 16 oz cup of coffee is not enough to cause significant bronchoprotection, bronchodilation, or decrease eNO values.

45,2019,8211873,"Background: While high doses of caffeine may affect pulmonary function and bronchial challenge tests in patients with mild asthma, the effects of lower doses ( or = 5 mg/kg) are less well documented. Specific recommendations exist for withholding theophylline, but not caffeine, before bronchoprovocation and pulmonary function testing. Methods: To assess the effect of a single oral dose of caffeine (5 mg/kg) on FEV1 and bronchial responsiveness to histamine a double blind, placebo controlled study was performed in eight patients with mild stable asthma. Results: While caffeine had no effect on FEV1, mean (95% confidence interval) log PC20 histamine was significantly higher 150 minutes [caffeine = 0.99 (0.2) mg/ml, placebo = 0.53 (0.29)] and 240 minutes [caffeine = 0.89 (0.24), placebo = 0.44 (0.26)] after administration of caffeine than after placebo.

45,2019,3823636,"The potential influence of dietary caffeine on bronchoprovocation challenges with carbachol was examined in 7 patients with asymptomatic asthma. In a double-blind fashion placebo or caffeine (6 mg/kg body weight; equivalent to approximately 4 cups of coffee) solved in orange juice was administered, and carbachol challenges were performed. The average peak serum concentration achieved 60 min after dosing was 7.6 +/- SD 2.1 mg/l. These caffeine levels did not produce any appreciable attenuation of the bronchoconstrictor response to carbachol inhalations. It thus appears that dietary caffeine is barely a cause of erroneous interpretations of bronchoprovocation challenges with carbachol.",Can caffeine help people with asthma?,caffeine asthma,1.0,Can caffeine help people with asthma?,0.297049343585968
45,2019,34644210,"Objective: Coffee intake has been inversely associated with asthma in adults. We examined the relation between urinary levels of caffeine or caffeine metabolites and asthma, lung function, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in adults. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 2,832 adults aged 18-79 years in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Multivariable logistic or linear regression was used for the analysis of urinary levels of caffeine or each of its three major metabolites (paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline) and current asthma, lung function, and FeNO. Results: Subjects with urinary paraxanthine levels in the fourth quartile (Q4) had 53% lower odds of current asthma than those whose urinary paraxanthine levels were in the first quartile (Q1; 95% confidence = 0.22 to 1.00). Among never and former smokers, subjects with urinary theophylline levels above Q1 had 49% lower odds of current asthma than those whose urinary theophylline level was in Q1 (95% CI = 0.31 to 0.85). Among subjects without current asthma, each log 10 -unit increment in paraxanthine level was associated with a 0.83% increment in percent predicted (%pred) FEV 1 and a 1.27% increment in %pred FVC, while each log 10 -unit in theophylline was associated with a 1.24% increment in %pred FVC. Neither urinary caffeine nor any urinary caffeine metabolite was associated with bronchodilator response or FeNO. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that two caffeine metabolites (theophylline and paraxanthine) may contribute to the previously reported inverse association between coffee intake and asthma in adults.",Can caffeine help people with asthma?,caffeine asthma,1.0,Can caffeine help people with asthma?,0.886107325553894
47,2019,17943845,"Background: There is lack of theoretical and clinical knowledge of the use of insoles for prevention or treatment of back pain. The high incidence of back pain and the popularity of shoe insoles call for a systematic review of this practice. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of shoe insoles in the prevention and treatment of non-specific back pain compared to placebo, no intervention, or other interventions. Search strategy: We searched the following databases: The Cochrane Back Group Trials Register and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to March 2005, and MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to February 2007; reviewed reference lists in review articles, guidelines and in the included trials; conducted citation tracking; contacted individuals with expertise in this domain. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials that examined the use of customized or non-customized insoles, for the prevention or treatment of back pain, compared to placebo, no intervention or other interventions. Study outcomes had to include at least one of the following: self-reported incidence or physician diagnosis of back pain; pain intensity; duration of back pain; absenteeism; functional status. Studies of insoles designed to treat limb length inequality were excluded. Data collection and analysis: One review author conducted the searches and blinded the retrieved references for authors, institution and journal. Two review authors independently selected the relevant articles.

47,2019,15668775,"The prevalence and incidence of low back pain in general society is high. Workers whose job involves walking long distances have an even higher tendency to suffer from low back pain. A positive effect of insoles in reducing low back pain was found in professional sports players. This was not examined on people whose job involves walking long distances. In this double blind prospective study we examined the effectiveness of insoles constructed in a computerized method to placebo insoles in 58 employees whose work entailed extensive walking and who suffered from low back pain. The evaluation was performed by the MILLION questionnaire, which is considered as a valid questionnaire for evaluation of low back pain. We calculated the differences of the pain intensity before and after the intervention, in the employees using the insoles manufactured by computer in comparison to the users of the placebo insoles. In each group, the analysis was performed in comparison to the baseline. A total of 81% of the employees preferred the real insoles as effective and comfortable in comparison to 19% of the users of the placebo insoles (P 0.05). The results of this study indicate a substantial improvement in the low back pain after the use of the true insoles. The average pain intensity according to the MILLION questionnaire before the use of the insoles was 5.46. However, after the use of the real insoles and the placebo insoles, the average pain intensity decreased to 3.96 and 5.11, respectively. The difference of the average pain intensity at the start of the study and after the use of the real insoles was significant: -1.49 (P=0.0001), whereas this difference after the use of the placebo insoles was not significant: -0.31 (P=0.1189). The reported severity of pain also decreased significantly: a level 5 pain and above was reported by 77% of the subjects at the start of the study. After the use of the real insoles only 37.9% of the subjects reported a similar degree of pain severity, and 50% of the subjects did so after the use of the placebo insoles (P 0.05). We did not find a link between low back pain and other variables such as gender, age, number of offspring, work seniority, smoking, previous use of insoles and previous medication.

Insoles are often prescribed to reduce the pain which, in turn, may promote return to normal activities. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of insoles on foot pain and daily activities, and to investigate the relationship between individuals' satisfaction with insoles and actual use of them. Study design: A 4-week pre-post intervention follow-up. Methods: Brief Pain Inventory, International Physical Activity Questionnaire and Lower Extremities Functional Status were used as outcome measures. Client Satisfaction with Device was used in the follow-up. Results: A total of 67 participants answered the questionnaires (81% women). Overall, a reduction in Pain Severity (p = 0.002) and Pain Interference (p = 0.008) was shown. Secondary analyses revealed a significant effect only in women. No changes in daily activities (Walking, p = 0.867; Total Physical Activity, p = 0.842; Lower Extremities Functional Status, p = 0.939) could be seen. There was no relation between Client Satisfaction with Device measures and duration of insole use. A difference in sex was shown; women scored higher than men on Pain Severity. Conclusion: Insoles reduce pain and pain interference with daily activities for women with foot pain. Satisfaction with the insoles is not a predictor of actual insole use. The effect of insoles on activity performance needs further study. Clinical relevance: This study provides evidence for prescribing insoles to people with foot pain.

49,2019,7588084,"Sulfasalazine was first used for rheumatic polyarthritis in the 1940s and in the past 2 decades has become firmly established as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). The drug is split by the action of bacterial azoreductases in the large intestine into sulfapyridine and mesalazine (mesalamine, 5-aminosalicylic acid), although whether the parent molecule or the sulfapyridine moiety, or both, is the active principle remains uncertain. Sulfasalazine is an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), producing improvements in disease parameters similar to those seen with penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine or oral or parenteral gold in comparative clinical trials. However, there are no direct comparisons of the drug with methotrexate. Most adverse events associated with sulfasalazine are minor and tend to occur within 3 months of starting therapy. A meta-analysis of studies investigating DMARD therapy, which included almost 5000 evaluable patients, concluded that sulfasalazine was close to methotrexate in terms of efficacy but was slightly less well tolerated. However, unlike sulfasalazine, many DMARDs may be unsuitable for women who are, or may become, pregnant because of their potential to cause teratogenic effects. Sulfasalazine may also offer a more rapid onset of action than other DMARDs and may slow down the radiological progression of RA. Combination therapy with other DMARDs, particularly methotrexate, appears more effective than single DMARD therapy. If the safety of these regimens is shown in large numbers of patients they are likely to become more widely used in the future. Sulfasalazine is a therapy of first choice in patients with RA and may be the DMARD of choice in women who are, or may become, pregnant.",Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,0.5704390406608582

Results: SSZ was superior to placebo in reducing the laboratory features of inflammation, the clinical parameters of disease activity, as well as the scintigraphic activity in the joints. Furthermore, fewer erosive changes developed in the joints of patients receiving active treatment, but the difference between treatment groups did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: SSZ is effective in the treatment of RA, and its onset of action is rapid. The results support the view that SSZ retards the development of joint erosions.

49,2019,2899645,"Sulfasalazine is now an established 2nd line agent in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but its mode of action is unknown. Two separate studies have investigated the possibility that it works in RA by influencing lymphocyte function. After 12 weeks of treatment with sulfasalazine, elevated levels of circulating activated lymphocytes and abnormal ex vivo mitogen response to concanavalin A (Con-A) in 11 patients with RA reverted to normal. An in vitro study investigated the effect of sulfasalazine and its metabolites on mitogen response by healthy and RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-hydroxy SP suppressed the response of RA PBMC to Con-A. Sulfasalazine, SP and N-acetyl SP suppressed the response of healthy PBMC to pokeweed mitogen. 5-aminosalicylic acid also affected mitogen response and cell viability, which may be relevant to actions of this metabolite within the gut.",Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,0.9993048906326294
49,2019,19606939,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder primarily targeting the synovium. Unchecked disease activity is associated with significant morbidity and an increased mortality. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of RA and the capability of biologically engineered treatments for RA have expanded the armamentarium of antirheumatic agents. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted through PubMed. Results/conclusions: At present, a common strategy for the treatment of RA uses methotrexate either as monotherapy or in combination with a variety of conventional and/or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), with the goal of inducing remission of active disease. The choice of which agent(s) to use is based upon patient-specific criteria (activity of disease, comorbidities, patient preferences, costs etc.). Emerging therapies that target specific cytokines and growth factors in the inflammatory cascade of RA offer a potent new means of modifying disease activity, but many questions regarding their use remain unanswered.",Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,0.9998295307159424
49,2019,19476397,"Treatment strategies in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have significantly changed in the past decade. The early use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is the basis of this new treatment strategy. Because these agents alter the natural disease course of RA, early aggressive intervention results in better outcomes with respect to future structural damage and disability. The arrival of the 'biologic agents' era in rheumatology has further improved the therapeutic options in patients with RA. A significant portion of individuals with this ailment are elderly, with approximately one-third of patients experiencing their first symptoms after the age of 60 years. Yet, many elderly patients with RA do not receive optimal treatment. Although the reasons for this have not been completely defined, it seems clinicians are reluctant to use DMARDs in the elderly because of uncertainty regarding their efficacy and safety in this population. The aging process is associated with important changes in drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. It appears that the former, mainly through decreased renal clearance, is responsible for an increased incidence of adverse effects with some DMARDs. The old are also more susceptible to infection than the young, making prevention of infectious disease through vaccination of particular importance; however, healthcare professionals should be aware that some DMARDs, including biologic agents, may interfere with responses to vaccination. The available data, although limited, suggest that DMARDs, including some biologic agents, are similarly effective in the old and the young, while maintaining very good adverse effect profiles. Therefore, the elderly with RA should not be excluded from receiving optimal treatment with these medications. At the same time, clinicians must be aware of the possible increased risk of drug toxicities, recognize the need to adjust therapy to match individual patient characteristics (i.e. renal function, co-morbidities, concomitant medication use or polypharmacy), and use the lowest possible effective dosage. This review describes the special considerations to be taken into account when administering conventional (synthetic) or biologic DMARDs to elderly patients with RA.",Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,0.585084080696106
49,2019,16114981,"Sulfasalazine (salazosulfapyridine) [Azulfidine, Salazopyrin] is a well established disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical trials with sulfasalazine have used an array of measures of disease activity, such as the number of tender and swollen joints, Ritchie articular index (RAI) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). In randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, sulfasalazine was associated with statistically significant benefits for various measures of disease activity, according to results of individual trials and/or meta-analysis. Sulfasalazine was associated with broadly similar efficacy to that of various other DMARDs in several randomised, double-blind, comparative trials. Promising results have also been demonstrated with sulfasalazine in combination with other DMARDs (e.g. methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine) in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis and in those with more established disease. Sulfasalazine was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse effects being adverse gastrointestinal effects, headache, dizziness and rash; myelosuppression can also occur. Sulfasalazine has a relatively short lag time until its onset of action and is often considered to be among the more efficacious traditional DMARDs. Based on considerations of safety, convenience and cost, many rheumatologists (particularly outside of the US) select sulfasalazine as initial therapy, although preferred first-line treatment options vary between countries.",Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,0.5794808864593506

Methods: A metaanalysis was performed on 15 randomized clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that included SSZ (2 g/day average dose, 36 weeks average followup) as a treatment. Eight trials included a placebo group (PL), 2 hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (350 mg/day average dose), 3 D-penicillamine (D-Pen) (667 mg/day average dose), and 4 gold sodium thiomalate or aurothioglucose (GST) (25 mg, 1 g/wk). Results: Compared to PL, SSZ was superior for improvement in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (SSZ 37%, PL 14%; p 0.0001), morning stiffness duration (SSZ 61%, PL 33%; p = 0.008), pain visual analog scale (SSZ 42%, PL 15%; p 0.0001), articular index (SSZ 46%, PL 20%; p 0.0001), number of swollen joints (SSZ 51%, PL 26%; p 0.0001), number of painful joints (SSZ 59%, PL 33%; p = 0.004), and patient global assessment (SSZ 26%, PL 14%; p = 0.02). Withdrawals from study because of adverse drug reactions were increased (SSZ 24%, PL 7%; p 0.0001), but lack of efficacy dropouts were decreased (SSZ 8%, PL 21%; p 0.0001). Compared to HCQ, SSZ tended to have fewer lack of efficacy dropouts (SSZ 5%, HCQ 15%; p = 0.055) and improved ESR (SSZ 43%, HCQ 26%; p = 0.10) and morning stiffness duration (SSZ 59%, HCQ 40%; p = 0.09).

50,2019,35949186,"Introduction: Obesity is a chronic disease with a complex interplay of multiple factors such as genetic, metabolic, behavioral, and environmental factors. The management of obesity includes; lifestyle modification, psychological therapy, pharmacological therapy, and bariatric surgery. To date, bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for obesity by offering a long-term reduction in weight, remission of obesity-related complications, and improving quality of life. However, bariatric surgery is not equally effective in all patients. Thus, if we can predict who would benefit most, it will improve the risk versus benefit ratio of having surgery. Areas covered: In this narrative review, we explore the question on who will benefit the most from bariatric surgery by examining the recent evidence in the literature. In addition, we investigate the predisposing predictors of bariatric surgery response. Finally, we offer the best strategies in the clinic to explain the potential benefits of bariatric surgery to patients. Expert opinion: Bariatric surgery is an effective obesity management approach. Despite its efficacy, considerable variation of individual response exists. Thus, it is important to recognize patients that will benefit most, but at present very few predictors are available which can be clinically useful.",Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,0.9936538934707642
50,2019,16220044,"Purpose of review: Bariatric surgery today is the only effective therapy for morbid obesity. Commonly performed procedures include adjustable gastric banding and vertical banded gastroplasty, variations of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch, and mixed procedures. This review discusses key issues in the surgical management of morbid obesity. Recent findings: The two most common bariatric procedures performed worldwide are laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Controversy exists regarding the best surgical procedure. Weight loss decreases according to the procedures performed in following decreasing order: biliopancreatic diversion, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical banded gastroplasty, adjustable gastric banding. Concerning the complications and quality of life, there is no single operation for morbid obesity without drawbacks. Cost-effectiveness analyses have demonstrated that bariatric surgery is cost effective at less than 50,000 US dollars/quality-adjusted life years. Summary: According to current opinion, gastric restrictive procedures (adjustable gastric banding, vertical banded gastroplasty) are generally considered safe and quick to perform, but the long-term outcome and quality of life have been questioned. By contrast, the long-term efficacy of adjustable gastric banding can be improved by the development of new band devices. More complex bariatric procedures, such as the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion, have a greater potential for serious perioperative complications but are associated with good long-term outcome in terms of weight loss combined with less dietary restriction.",Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,0.9861454963684082

In addition, childhood obesity is increasingly becoming a prominent diagnosis. Objective: To identify physician and payer reactions to the profiles of 4 new obesity products in development and the potential that these will be prescribed by physicians and reimbursed by payers. This article examines payers' and physicians' perspectives in effective treatment options for this epidemic. Method: A 2008 online survey conducted by Reimbursement Intelligence was completed by 42 physicians who are advisors to Pharmacy &amp; Therapeutics Committees and see an average of 435 obese patients monthly, as well as 17 payers who represent more than 100 million covered lives. This research was double blinded to conceal product and client identification. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from the survey responses. Results: Based on the physician and payer survey responses, morbid obesity is expected to grow in the next 2 years. About 80% of morbidly obese patients have type 2 diabetes, but more than 75% of payers do not track patients who are obese, morbidly obese, or those with the metabolic syndrome. Despite its effect on business productivity and the cost of care, healthcare professionals and payers continue to have varying perspectives related to its prevention and treatment. Physicians would like to have more treatment options, but payers perceive them as ineffective and find the safety and adverse effect profiles unfavorable.

Their geographical distribution is closely correlated to the availability of moisture. Very little work has been done on the effects of reducing humidity in the home environment in the long term, with a view to controlling dust mite populations. Two different methods which might reduce humidities to levels which could successfully reduce dust mite numbers are dehumidifiers, and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR).

The aims of this study were to analyze DH tolerance in asthmatic patients, to assess the parasitological effects and to analyze the environmental effects produced by the use of these appliances in the bedrooms of asthmatic patients sensitized to house dust mites. 10 stable asthmatic patients sensitized to house dust mites were studied. DH appliances (CD-300) were installed in their bedrooms. Each patient was given symptom scoring tables and a portable peak expiratory flow (P.E.F.) during a period of 5 months, 1 month before installing the DH and 4 months afterwards. To study the parasitological efficacy of the DHs, we analyzed dust samples from the bedrooms and determined the Der p I, Der f I and Der II allergens by means of a modified ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies.

While dehumidification alone is effective at reducing moisture necessary for mold growth, it is inadequate as a single intervention as it does not remove viable and non-viable fungal spores that are potentially allergenic. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate whether dehumidification in combination with high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filtration is effective at reducing airborne mold spore levels in day care centers. Two day care centers within a 2-mile radius of each other were selected. Day care center A was 2 years old with eight rooms while day care center B was 15 years old with six rooms. A high efficiency Santa Fe dehumidification unit equipped with a HEPA filter was installed in half the rooms (intervention) of each day care facility. Electronic HOBO data loggers continuously measured outdoor and indoor room dew point and temperature every 2 h throughout the study. Dew point and airborne fungal spore measurements from selected rooms with controlled air conditions were analyzed by comparing baseline measurements to those obtained at subsequent time periods over 1 year. Regression models accounted for correlations between measurements in the same room over time. Intervention resulted in a lowered average dew point from baseline by 8.8 degrees C compared with a decrease of 7.1 degrees C in non-intervention rooms across all time periods in both facilities (P 0.001). Fungal analyses demonstrated lower baseline (P=0.06) and follow-up means in intervention rooms (P 0.05), however the change from baseline to end of follow-up differed between intervention and non-intervention rooms in the two facilities. Log transformation was applied to approximate normality of fungal measurements. Dehumidification with HEPA filtration was effective at controlling indoor dew point in both facilities and at reducing airborne culturable fungal spore levels in one of the two facilities. These preliminary results provide a scientific rationale for using this intervention in future studies designed to investigate the impact of indoor mold exposure on health outcomes. Practical implications: Poor indoor air quality is a recognized cause or contributing factor to health effects. Dampness and humidity have been linked to upper and lower respiratory symptoms in children and adults. This study indicates that reducing indoor relative humidity and airborne mold spore levels using high-efficiency dehumidification units equipped with HEPA filtration is feasible even in work facilities such as day care centers where traffic in and out of the building is difficult to regulate. Clinicians should emphasize to their patients the importance of dehumidification and HEPA filtration to improve indoor air quality in the home and workplace.",Can dehumidifiers be used to control asthma?,dehumidifiers asthma,0.0,Can dehumidifiers be used to control asthma?,0.7099277377128601
51,2019,30849253,"Background: Despite growing access to effective therapies, asthma control still needs improvement. Many non-drug factors, such as allergens, air pollutants and stress also affect asthma control and patient quality of life, but an overview of the effectiveness of non-drug interventions on asthma control was lacking. Objectives: To identify non-drug interventions likely to improve asthma control. Methods: A systematic review of the available literature in Medline and the Cochrane Library was conducted in March 2017, without any time limit. Initial searching identified 884 potentially relevant clinical trial reports, literature reviews and meta-analyses, which were screened for inclusion using criteria of quality, relevance, and reporting outcomes based on asthma control. Results: Eighty-two publications met the inclusion criteria. In general, the quality of the studies was low. Patient education programmes (22 studies) significantly improved asthma control. Multifaceted interventions (10 studies), which combined patient education programmes with decreasing exposure to indoor allergens and pollutants, significantly improved asthma control based on clinically relevant outcomes. Renovating homes to reduce exposure to allergens and indoor pollutants improved control (two studies). Air filtration systems (five studies) were effective, especially in children exposed to second-hand smoke. Most measures attempting to reduce exposure to dust mites were ineffective (five studies). Dietary interventions (eight studies) were ineffective. Promoting physical activity (five studies) tended to yield positive results, but the results did not attain significance. Conclusion: Twenty-six interventions were effective in asthma control.

51,2019,18360647,"Sensitization to the house dust mite (Dermataphagoides pteronyssinus) (HDM) is the most common risk factor associated with the development of asthma in adults and children. The effectiveness of HDM control measures in the treatment of asthma is not yet proven. The strategies for control for avoidance depend on our understanding of the biology of the HDM. The evidence suggests a favorable effect of transferring allergic asthmatic children to naturally low dust mite environments, such as at altitude or in hospital, but little to suggest that this can be replicated in general practice by simple practical measures such as mattress covers. However, a recent multi-allergen reduction approach has suggested benefits may be achievable. HDM densities tend to be high in warm, humid conditions in the home, which may be modified by external factors, such as ventilation. However, ventilation control to reduce indoor humidity has had inconsistent effects on dust mite levels and asthma.

A self-report survey questionnaire elicited experiences of respiratory symptoms, disease history, and characteristics of residential environmental factors from schoolchildren. The proportion of schoolchildren having physician-diagnosed asthma was 9.8% and suspected asthma was 16.1%. The proportions of having respiratory symptoms in the past 12 months ranged from 9.8% for wheezing without a cold to 40.5% for exercise-induced cough. Higher proportions of boys had non-exercise-induced respiratory symptoms, physician-diagnosed asthma, and suspected asthma than girls (p 0.05). Exposure to odoriferous chemical vapor was significantly associated with all seven respiratory symptoms considered in the study (p 0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors including residential districts, gender, diagnosed allergy, and parental history of respiratory symptoms, odoriferous chemical vapors, gas leaks, dehumidifier use, presence of cockroaches at home, and leaky water/water puddle at home were significantly associated with the proportions of physician-diagnosed asthma or suspected asthma of the schoolchildren. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of physician-diagnosed asthma was 2.35 (95% confidential interval = 1.45-3.82) for odoriferous chemical vapor. The aOR of suspected asthma measure was 2.14 (95% CI = 1.40-3.26) for odoriferous chemical vapor.

101,2021,33345010,"Background: Following an Achilles tendon rupture, ankle foot orthoses (AFO) of different designs are used to protect the healing tendon. They are generally designed to protect against re-rupture by preventing undesired dorsiflexion and to prevent elongation by achieving plantarflexion in the ankle. There is limited knowledge of the biomechanical effects of different AFO designs and ankle angles on the tendon and lower leg muscles. Hypothesis: The hypothesis was that non-uniform displacement in the Achilles tendon, lower leg muscle activity, and plantar pressure distribution would be affected differently in different designs of AFO and by varying the degree of dorsiflexion limitation. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Ultrasound of the Achilles tendon, EMG of the lower leg muscles and plantar pressure distribution were recorded in 16 healthy subjects during walking on a treadmill unbraced and wearing three designs of AFO. Ultrasound speckle tracking was used to estimate motion within the tendon. The tested AFO designs were a rigid AFO and a dorsal brace used together with wedges and an AFO with an adjustable ankle angle restricting dorsiflexion to various degrees. Results: There were no significant differences in non-uniform tendon displacement or muscle activity between the different designs of AFO. For the rigid AFO and the adjustable AFO there was a significant reduction in non-uniform displacement within the tendon and soleus muscle activity as restriction in dorsiflexion increased. Conclusion: The degree of dorsiflexion allowed within an AFO had greater effects on Achilles tendon displacement patterns and muscle activity in the calf than differences in AFO design. AFO settings that allowed ankle dorsiflexion to neutral resulted in displacement patterns in the Achilles tendon and muscle activity in the lower leg which were close to those observed during unbraced walking.",Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,ankle brace achilles tendonitis,0.0,Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,0.4326736629009247
101,2021,16764795,"Background: Surgical and nonsurgical treatments of Achilles tendon ruptures are available. Nonsurgical treatment using immobilization does not have the varying degrees of infection as seen with surgical procedures, but it frequently is linked to muscle atrophy, weakness, and higher rates of rerupture than surgical treatment. This study reports the results of 64 patients with Achilles tendon ruptures treated surgically and with early mobilization. Methods: Surgery of the ruptured tendon involved dividing the proximal stump into two separate strands and the distal stump into a single strand. The repair was advanced to a V-Y formation, and nonabsorbable sutures were used for repair. After wound closure, an early mobilization rehabilitation program was initiated, which consisted of wearing a moveable ankle brace for 4 to 6 weeks in 0 to 15 degrees of dorsiflexion and 10 weeks of regular exercises. Results: All 64 patients resumed normal activities in an average of 3.3 months regardless of whether the rupture was acute or chronic. Tendons healed with no reruptures. There were 13 complications, all wound infections, which healed when treated with antibiotics. The infection rate dropped markedly when wounds were inspected and dressings changed 1 week postoperatively, instead of at 2 weeks. Conclusion: Surgery combined with early mobilization reduces range of motion loss, increases blood supply, and reduces the degree of muscle atrophy that typically occurs after Achilles tendon rupture, thereby decreasing the time to resumption of normal activities. Applying tension to the tendon also improved strength of the calf muscles and improved ankle movement. The main concern with early mobilization is rerupture, but this was lessened by patients carefully following the weightbearing and early mobilization protocols. The results of this study strengthen the argument to employ early mobilization rehabilitation after surgical repair.",Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,ankle brace achilles tendonitis,0.0,Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,0.7492911219596863
101,2021,26261783,"Background: we investigated how ruptured Achilles tendons are loaded in a brace. There is an ongoing discussion whether patients should be recommended to bear weight on the injured limb. However, little is known about the effects of bracing on tensional loading of the healing Achilles tendon: it is uncertain if load-bearing actually stresses the Achilles tendon inside a brace. Methods: we measured plantar flexion moment inside the brace, in order to estimate tensional loading of the tendon, by use of an insole with pressure transducers. Results: after wearing the brace for 1 hour, young healthy individuals reduced their maximum flexion moment during gait by half. Patients with Achilles tendon rupture showed no measurable flexion moment during gait with the brace, 4 or 7 weeks after injury. Only when specifically instructed, they could produce a considerable plantar flexion moment. We noted that gait speed with the brace at 4 weeks correlated with a heel-raise functional test at 1 year: the higher the spontaneous gait speed, the less the functional difference between the injured and the uninjured leg (r(2)=0.68; p=0.002).

Purpose: To compare ≥10-year outcomes of 2 postoperative regimens after Achilles tendon rupture repair: early weightbearing with early mobilization versus early weightbearing with early immobilization in tension. Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 50 patients with acute Achilles tendon ruptures were randomized postoperatively to receive either early movement of the ankle between neutral and plantar flexion in a brace for 6 weeks (group 1) or Achilles tendon immobilization in tension using a below-knee cast with the ankle in a neutral position for 6 weeks (group 2). Patients were assessed at 3, 6, and 14 months and 11 years postoperatively. Results: There were 37 patients (74%) evaluated at a mean (±SD) of 11.0 ± 0.9 years. The mean Leppilahti score was 92.9 ± 5.6 in group 1 and 93.6 ± 7.2 in group 2 (P = .68). The mean isokinetic plantar flexion peak torque deficits or average work deficits in plantar flexion showed no differences between the groups with any angular velocity. Isokinetic strength changed minimally between 1 and 11 years compared with the unaffected ankle, but a mean deficit of 5% in peak torque and mean deficit of 8% in average work were still present after 11 years. On the contrary, isometric plantar flexion strength recovered significantly, with only a 2.4% difference at 11-year follow-up. Conclusion: After the 11-year follow-up, early mobilization and immobilization in tension after Achilles rupture repair resulted in similar clinical outcomes and isokinetic strengths.

101,2021,27440563,"Background: An infected Achilles tendon after tendon repair is particularly difficult to treat because of the poor vascularity of the tendon as well as the thin surrounding soft tissue. For treatment of an infected Achilles tendon following tendon repair, we first focused on complete debridement and then promoted fibrous scar healing of the Achilles tendon using functional treatment. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all of the medical records of 15 tertiary referral patients with postoperative infection of the Achilles tendon occurring between 2007 and 2012. The mean follow-up time was 33 months (range, 22 to 97 months). The infected tissue and the necrotic tendon were debrided, and the ankle was placed in a short leg splint for 2 weeks. The splint was then replaced with an ankle brace for the next 4 weeks. Partial weight-bearing was allowed immediately, and full weight-bearing was allowed at 2 weeks postoperatively. We assessed and recorded the physical parameters such as the range of motion, calf circumference, ability to perform a single-limb heel rise, patient satisfaction, and Arner-Lindholm scale. Laboratory tests, postoperative ultrasonography, and isokinetic plantar flexion power tests were also performed. Results: At a mean time of 17 days (range, 8 to 30 days) after debridement, infection signs such as discharge from the wound, redness, and local warmth resolved. The wound had healed and the stitches were removed at a mean of 17 days following the wound repair. At the time of the latest follow-up, there were no signs of active infection. Achilles tendon continuity recovered in all patients by fibrous scar healing. Compared with the contralateral side, there was no difference in the ankle range of motion in 8 patients. According to the Arner-Lindholm scale, 9 of the 15 results were excellent and 6 were good. Ten patients were able to perform a single-limb heel rise. Eleven of 15 patients returned to their pre-injury recreational activities. Diffuse homogeneous echotexture of the Achilles tendon with continuity was observed on the ultrasonographic examination. Conclusions: In this retrospective series, radical debridement, combined with antibiotic therapy and functional rehabilitation, was successful in eradicating infection and maintaining function in patients with postoperative infection following Achilles tendon repair.

101,2021,19340434,"Introduction: There is a trend towards surgical treatment of acute ruptured Achilles tendon. While classical open surgical procedures have been shown to restore good functional capacity, they are potentially associated with significant complications like wound infection and paresthesia. Modern mini-invasive surgical techniques significantly reduce these complications and are also associated with good functional results so that they can be considered as the surgical treatment of choice. Nevertheless, there is still a need for conservative alternative and recent studies report good results with conservative treatment in rigid casts or braces. Patients/method: We report the use of a dynamic ankle brace in the conservative treatment of Achilles tendon rupture in a prospective non-randomised study of 57 consecutive patients. Patients were evaluated at an average follow-up time of 5 years using the modified Leppilahti Ankle Score, and the first 30 patients additionally underwent a clinical examination and muscular testing with a Cybex isokinetic dynamometer at 6 and 12 months. Results: We found good and excellent results in most cases. We observed five complete re-ruptures, almost exclusively in case of poor patient's compliance, two partial re-ruptures and one deep venous thrombosis complicated by pulmonary embolism. Conclusion: Although prospective comparison with other modern treatment options is still required, the functional outcome after early ankle mobilisation in a dynamic cast is good enough to ethically propose this method as an alternative to surgical treatment.",Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,ankle brace achilles tendonitis,0.0,Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,0.9933049082756042

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, Scopus and the Cochrane Library through May 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included patients treated non-surgically for Achilles tendon rupture. All analyses were stratified according to rehabilitation protocols. Results: Eight RCTs with a total of 978 patients were included. There was no significant difference about re-rupture rate (P=0.38), return to sports (P=0.85) and work (P=0.33), functional outcome (P=0.34), quality of life (P=0.50), and complication rate (P=0.29) between early weight bearing with functional ankle motion and traditional ankle immobilisation with non-weight bearing. Similarly, no significant difference in re-rupture rate (P=0.88), return to sports (P=0.45) and work (P=0.20), functional outcome (P=0.26), and complication rate (P=0.49) was seen between ankle immobilisation with non-weight bearing and early weight bearing without functional ankle motion. Conclusions: Traditional ankle immobilisation with non-weight bearing was not found to be superior to early weight bearing with or without functional ankle motion for patients treated non-surgically for Achilles tendon rupture.

101,2021,27746496,"Background: Transfer of a flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon can not only reconstruct the Achilles tendon but also provide ischemic tendinous tissues with a rich blood supply to enhance wound healing. This retrospective study aims to investigate clinical outcomes in patients who underwent repair of Kuwada grade IV chronic Achilles tendon rupture with long hallucis longus tendons harvested using a minimally invasive technique. Materials and methods: 35 patients who were treated for Kuwada grade IV Achilles tendon injuries from July 2006 to June 2011 were included in this retrospective study. The age ranged between 23 and 71 years. The duration from primary injury to surgery ranged from 29 days to 34 months (mean value, 137.6 days). All 35 patients had difficulties in lifting their calves. Thirty two were followed up for a mean 32.2 months (range 18-72 months), whereas three were lost to followup. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the tendon rupture gap ranged from 6.0 to 9.2 cm. During surgery, a 2.0 cm minor incision was made vertically in the medial plantar side of the midfoot, and a 1.5 cm minor transverse incision was made in the plantar side of the interphalangeal articulation of the great toe to harvest the FHL tendon, and the tendon was fixed to the calcaneus with suture anchors. Postoperative appearance and function were evaluated by physiotherapists based American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society-ankle and hindfoot score (AOFAS-AH), and Leppilahti Achilles tendon ratings. Results: Results were assessed in 32 patients. Except for one patient who suffered complications because of wound disruption 10 days after the operation, all other patients had primary wound healing, with 28 of 32 able to go up on their toes at last followup. The AOFAS-AH score was increased from preoperative (51.92 ± 7.08) points to (92.56 ± 6.71) points; Leppilahti Achilles tendon score was increased from preoperative (72.56 ± 7.43) to (92.58 ± 5.1). There were statistically significant differences. The result of the total excellent and good rate was 93.8% (30/32).

101,2021,27000133,"Background When Achilles tendon ruptures become chronic, a defect often forms at the rupture site. There is scant literature regarding the treatment of chronic Achilles ruptures with defects of 6 cm or larger. We examined outcomes from combining a turndown of the proximal, central Achilles with a flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon transfer to treat this condition. Materials Between September 2002 and December 2013, 32 patients presented with a chronic Achilles rupture and a defect of 6 cm or more. Twenty patients were male and 12 were female. Patient age was between 20 and 74 years, with a mean of 53.3 years. Eighteen and 14 patients had their right and left Achilles tendon affected, respectively. The number of days between injury and surgery ranged from 30 to 315 days, with a mean of 102 days. Reconstruction of the Achilles involved a turndown of the proximal, central tendon and FHL augmentation. Final patient follow-up ranged from 18 to 150 months, with a mean of 62.3 months. Results: At surgery, the gap between the ruptured ends of the Achilles ranged from 6 to 12 cm, with a mean gap of 7.5 cm. Full healing was achieved in all 32 patients (100%) by 5 months postoperatively. Mean Foot and Ankle Ability Measures scores increased from 36.3% to 90.2% between initial and latest follow-up (P .05). Mean visual analogue scales of pain decreased from 6.6 to 1.8 of 10 between first and last encounter (P .05). Postoperative complications occurred in 5 patients (15.6%), including 3 (9.4%) superficial wound problems, 1 (3.1%) deep wound infection, and 1 (3.1%) deep vein thrombosis. Discussion Outcomes from treating chronic Achilles ruptures with large defects are scant within the orthopaedic literature. Our method of Achilles reconstruction results in a high rate of improved function and pain relief.

During the bath, the decrease of the skin temperature induces not only peripheral vasoconstriction, shivering, and metabolic heat production, but also a discomfort. This discomfort occurs when there is a difference between the thermal informations coming from the body and the central thermoregulator set point. It triggers crying when the child has no way to escape. Considering the little effectiveness (0.3 degree C on average) of the association bath cooling and antipyretic treatment versus antipyretic treatment, and the preservation of the child comfort, bathing in tepid water is not useful in current care of children fever.",Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,tepid sponge bath reduce fever children,0.0,Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,0.10888119041919708
102,2021,8013170,"The effectiveness of tepid sponging, in addition to antipyretic medication, in the reduction of temperature in febrile children living in a tropical environment, was assessed in a prospective, randomized, open trial. Seventy-five children aged between 6 and 53 months who attended the casualty department of the Children's Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, with fever (rectal temperature &gt; or = 38.5 degrees C) of presumed viral origin were randomized to received either tepid sponging and oral paracetamol (sponged group) or paracetamol alone (control group). Rectal temperature and the occurrence of crying, irritability, and shivering were recorded over the following 2 hours. A greater and more rapid fall in mean rectal temperature occurred in the sponged group than in the control group. Temperature fell below 38.5 degrees C sooner in children in the sponged group than in control children (P 0.001).

102,2021,11113027,"Although physical methods of cooling are the treatment of choice for hyperthermia, their value in the treatment of fever remains uncertain. Methods involving convection and evaporation are more effective than those involving conduction for the treatment of hyperthermia. These same methods, combined with antipyretic medication, are preferable to immersion as treatment for fever in young children but are generally not practical in adults. Febrile children treated with tepid-water sponging plus antipyretic drugs are more uncomfortable that those treated with antipyretic drugs alone, although they exhibit slightly more rapid reductions in temperature. When febrile, seriously ill patients are externally cooled and are sedated or paralyzed with drugs that suppress shivering, they may have a more rapid reduction of fever and reduced energy expenditure than if treated with antipyretic drugs alone.

We did not find any studies reporting on the effectiveness of tepid sponging in addition to dipyrone. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of tepid sponging plus dipyrone with dipyrone alone for reducing fever. Design and setting: A randomized clinical trial was undertaken at Instituto Materno-Infantil Professor Fernando Figueira, Recife, Pernambuco. Methods: Children from six months to five years old with axillary temperature greater than 38 masculineC in the emergency ward between January and July 2006 were eligible. One hundred and twenty children were randomly assigned to receive oral dipyrone (20 mg/kg) or oral dipyrone and tepid sponging for 15 minutes. The primary outcome was mean temperature reduction after 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Secondary outcomes were crying and irritability. Results: 106 children finished the study. After the first 15 minutes, the fall in axillary temperature was significantly greater in the sponged group than in the control group (p 0.001). From 30 to 120 minutes, better fever control was observed in the control group. Crying and irritability were observed respectively in 52% and 36% of the sponged children and in none and only two of the controls. Conclusions: Tepid sponging plus dipyrone cooled faster during the first 15 minutes, but dipyrone alone presented better fever control over the two-hour period.

102,2021,9425385,"A block randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy of tepid sponging with the use of paracetamol in febrile children was undertaken at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre. Eighty children aged between 6 and 54 months with axillary temperatures of between &gt; or = 38.5 degrees C and or = 40 degrees C and a clinical diagnosis consistent with upper respiratory tract infection and/or malaria were block randomized to receive either oral paracetamol (15 mg/kg) or tepid sponging. Children receiving tepid sponging were sponged from head to toe (except the scalp) by leaving a thin layer of water on the body. If the body became dry it was repeated and continued until the axillary temperature fell to 38.5 degrees C. Axillary temperature and assessment of discomfort (convulsions, crying, irritability, vomiting and shivering) were recorded every 30 minutes for 2 hours.

102,2021,34138848,"Introduction: Divergent attitudes towards fever have led to a high level of inconsistency in approaches to its management. In an attempt to overcome this, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the symptomatic management of fever in children have been produced by several healthcare organizations. To date, a comprehensive assessment of the evidence level of the recommendations made in these CPGs has not been carried out. Methods: Searches were conducted on Pubmed, google scholar, pediatric society websites and guideline databases to locate CPGs from each country (with date coverage from January 1995 to September 2020). Rather than assessing overall guideline quality, the level of evidence for each recommendation was evaluated according to criteria of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM). A GRADE assessment was undertaken to assess the body of evidence related to a single question: the threshold for initiating antipyresis. Methods and results are reported according to the PRISMA statement. Results: 74 guidelines were retrieved. Recommendations for antipyretic threshold, type and dose; ambient temperature; dress/covering; activity; fluids; nutrition; proctoclysis; external applications; complementary/herbal recommendations; media; and age-related treatment differences all varied widely. OCEBM evidence levels for most recommendations were low (Level 3-4) or indeterminable. The GRADE assessment revealed a very low level of evidence for a threshold for antipyresis. Conclusion: There is no recommendation on which all guidelines agree, and many are inconsistent with the evidence-this is true even for recent guidelines. The threshold question is of fundamental importance and has not yet been answered. Guidelines for the most frequent intervention (antipyresis) remain problematic.",Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,tepid sponge bath reduce fever children,0.0,Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,0.4165765047073364

These include tepid sponging, removing clothes, and cooling the environment with fans to improve ventilation. The objective of this study is to assess the physical methods used by Sudanese rural mothers to manage a child with fever. A cross-sectional descriptive study was designed and conducted within 6 months; it involved 332 mothers of children under five. The data were collected through using a standardized administered questionnaire and focus group discussion and analyzed by statistical package for social science version 15.0 (SPSS). Tepid sponging was used by 47% of the interviewed mothers. 15% of the mothers increased fluid intake, 7% bathed the child and 5% put the child in light clothes. 59% of mothers applied tepid sponging on head, 33.9% on all the body, 3.7% and 2.2% on groin area and axilla, respectively. The majority of mothers (86%) used water from refrigerator or zeir [water clay pot] for applying tepid sponging, 9% used tap water, and 3% used ice water. In conclusion, this study revealed that the common physical treatment method for fever used by mothers was tepid sponging with inappropriate application.",Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,tepid sponge bath reduce fever children,0.0,Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,0.5595896244049072
102,2021,8587746,"A fever is defined as a rectal temp over 100.4 degrees F. Fever occurs when the hypothalamic thermoregulation center resets the temperature set point in response to a chain of events initiated by the inflammatory response. Glass thermometers remain the gold standard and electronic thermometers are generally acceptable, but studies do not consistently support the use of infrared ear thermometers in children under 3. Evaluation of the sick child includes observation, assessment of age and temperature risk factors, history and physical, and lab tests. To aid in the assessment of how ill or ""toxic"" a child appears, the Yale Observation Scale is used. Acetaminophen remains the antipyretic of choice. Febrile seizures are generally benign. Tepid sponge baths are only slightly more effective than acetaminophen alone in reducing fevers, but may be useful for children with a history of febrile seizures or liver disease. While there are many causes of pediatric fevers, they can be grouped into three general categories: fever with localizing signs, fever without localizing signs, and fever of unknown origin. Children with a localized infection are treated with antibiotics, antipyretics, and parent education; children with fever of unknown origin are referred for more in-depth evaluation.

In this review, the authors describe how current evidence does not support the use of folic acid supplements to protect against cognitive decline. Although a few studies suggest that folic acid supplementation may provide neuroprotection among persons who are folate deficient, there is also data to indicate that supplementation in persons without folate deficiency may pose a risk to neurological function. Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in old age and may not be easy to recognise. Folic acid supplementation may mask the anaemia associated with vitamin B12 deficiency and, therefore, may delay treatment while allowing progression of neurological symptoms. Whether or not folic acid supplementation exacerbates neurological symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency is not clear.

Folic acid enhances the plasma concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid (AA) are of benefit in dementia and Alzheimer's disease by up-regulating gene expression concerned with neurogenesis, neurotransmission and connectivity, improving endothelial nitric oxide (eNO) generation, enhancing brain acetylcholine levels, and suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. EPA, DHA, and AA also form precursors to anti-inflammatory compounds such as lipoxins, resolvins, and neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) that protect neurons from the cytotoxic action of various noxious stimuli. Furthermore, various neurotrophins and statins enhance the formation of NPD1 and thus, protect neurons from oxidative stress and prevent neuronal apoptosis Folic acid improves eNO generation, enhances plasma levels of EPA/DHA and thus, could augment the formation of NPD1.

103,2021,14584018,"Background: Folates are vitamins essential to the development of the central nervous system. Insufficient folate activity at the time of conception and early pregnancy can result in congenital neural tube defects. In adult life folate deficiency has been known for decades to produce a characteristic form of anaemia (""megaloblastic""). More recently degrees of folate inadequacy, not severe enough to produce anaemia, have been found to be associated with high blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine. Such degrees of folate inadequacy can arise because of insufficient folates in the diet or because of inefficient absorption or metabolic utilisation of folates due to genetic variations. Conventional criteria for diagnosing folate deficiency may be inadequate for identifying people capable of benefiting from dietary supplementation. High blood levels of homocysteine have been linked with the risk of arterial disease, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. There is therefore interest in whether dietary supplements of folic acid (an artificial chemical analogue of naturally occurring folates) can improve cognitive function of people at risk of cognitive decline associated with ageing or dementia, whether by affecting homocysteine metabolism or through other mechanisms. There is a risk that if folic acid is given to people who have undiagnosed deficiency of vitamin B12 it may lead to neurological damage. Vitamin B12 deficiency produces both an anaemia identical to that of folate deficiency but also causes irreversible damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems. Folic acid will correct the anaemia of vitamin B12 deficiency and so delay diagnosis but will not prevent progression to neurological damage. For this reason trials of folic acid supplements may involve simultaneous administration of vitamin B12. Apparent benefit from folic acid given in the combination would therefore need to be ""corrected"" for any effect of vitamin B12 alone. A separate Cochrane review of vitamin B12 and cognitive function is being prepared. Objectives: To examine the effects of folic acid supplementation, with or without vitamin B12, on elderly healthy and demented people, in preventing cognitive impairment or retarding its progress. Search strategy: Trials were identified from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Specialized Register Group on 9 April 2003 using the terms: folic acid, folate, vitamin B9, leucovorin, methyltetrahydrofolate, vitamin B12, cobalamin, cyanocobalamin, dementia, cognitive function, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, mixed dementia and controlled trials. MEDLINE and EMBASE (both all years) were searched for additional trials on healthy people. Selection criteria: All double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials, in which supplements of folic acid with or without vitamin B12 were compared with placebo for elderly healthy people or people with any type of dementia or cognitive impairment. Data collection and analysis: The reviewers independently applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality. One reviewer extracted and analysed the data. In comparing intervention with placebo, weighted mean differences, and standardized mean difference or odds ratios were estimated. Main results: Four randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. One trial (Bryan 2002) enrolled healthy women, and three (Fioravanti 1997; Sommer 1998; VITAL 2003) recruited people with mild to moderate cognitive impairment or dementia with or without diagnosed folate deficiency. Fioravanti 1997 enrolled people with mild to moderate cognitive impairment or dementia as judged by scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Global Deterioration Scale and with serum folate level 3ng/l. One trial (VITAL 2003) studied the effects of a combination of vitamin B12 and folic acid on patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or mixed dementia. The analysis from the included trials found no benefit from folic acid with or without vitamin B12 in comparison with placebo on any measures of cognition and mood for healthy or cognitively impaired or demented people: Folic acid effect and healthy participants: there was no benefit from of oral 750 mcg folic acid per day for five weeks compared with placebo on measures of cognition and mood of 19 healthy women aged 65 to 92. Folic acid effect and people with mild to moderate cognitive decline or dementia: there were no statistically significant results in favour of folic acid with or without vitamin B12 on any measures of cognitive function. Scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) revealed no statistically significant benefit from 2 mg per day folic acid plus 1mg vitamin B12 for 12 weeks when compared with placebo (WMD 0.39, 95% CI -0.43 to 1.21, P=0.35). Cognitive scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Scale (ADAS-Cog) showed no statistically significant benefit from 2 mg /day folic acid plus 1 mg /day vitamin B12 for 12 weeks compared with placebo (WMD 0.41, 95% -1.25 to 2.07, P=4.63). The Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADL) revealed no benefit from 2mg per day of folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12 for 12 weeks in comparison with placebo (WMD -0.57, 95%CI -1.95 to 0.81, P=0.42). None of the sub tests of the Randt Memory Test (RMT) showed statistically significant benefit from 15 mg of folic acid orally per day for 9 weeks when compared with placebo. One trial (Sommer 1998) reported a significant decline compared with placebo in two cognitive function tasks in demented patients who had received high doses of folic acid (10 mg /day) for unspecified periods. One trial (VITAL 2003) showed that 2 mg folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12 daily for 12 weeks significantly lowered serum homocysteine concentrations (P 0.0001). Reviewer's conclusions: There was no beneficial effect of 750 mcg of folic acid per day on measures of cognition or mood in older healthy women. In patients with mild to moderate cognitive decline and different forms of dementia there was no benefit from folic acid on measures of cognition or mood. Folic acid plus vitamin B12 was effective in reducing the serum homocysteine concentrations. Folic acid was well tolerated and no adverse effects were reported.

This is the first study evaluating folic acid or placebo in patients with dementia. Subjects had low-normal baseline folic acid levels. The magnitude of change between baseline and second testing was not statistically significant between the 2 groups. However, there was a trend for the folate group to perform worse on two specific cognitive measures, suggesting a possible trend toward worsening of some cognitive abilities after the folic acid.

103,2021,29255930,"Purpose: Observational studies have frequently reported that low blood folate concentrations are associated with poor cognitive performance. Our previous studies have shown the potential beneficial effect on the metabolite levels of methionine cycle and peripheral blood inflammatory cytokines from 6- and 12-month folic acid supplementation on cognitive function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study aims to continue exploring the effect of 24-month folic acid supplementation on cognitive function and pathological mechanism in MCI. Methods: 180 individuals with MCI were identified and randomly divided into intervention (folic acid 400 µg/day, n = 90) and convention (n = 90) groups. Cognitive function (WAIS-RC) and blood Aβ-related biomarkers were measured at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equation. This trial has been registered with Trial Number: ChiCTR-TRC-13003227. Results: During the follow-up, scores of full scale IQ, verbal IQ, and subdomains of Information and Digit Span were significantly higher in the intervention group than those in the convention group (P 0.05). In the intervention group, blood homocysteine, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), Aβ-42, and the expression of APP-mRNA were decreased (P 0.05), while S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), SAM/SAH ratio, and the expression of DNA methyltransferase mRNA were increased (P 0.05).

The aim of present study was to evaluate the effects of folic acid on passive avoidance task and motor coordination in healthy adult male rats. Materials and methods: Animals were randomly divided into five groups with 10 in each. 1) Sham treated (Veh); received same volume of normal saline as folate vehicle, 2-5) Test groups; each received a single dose of folate (5, 10 and 15 mg/ml/kg, IP daily for one week). At the end of the treatment with folic acid or vehicle, motor coordination in rotarod (after 24 hr) and passive avoidance memory in shuttle box (after 2 and 30 days) were evaluated, respectively. Results: The results showed that folic acid (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg) increased short-term (P 0.05, P 0.001) memory while, long term memory affected significantly with doses 10 and 15 mg/kg (P 0.01, P 0.001). On the other hand, folic acid (5 and 10 mg/kg) had significant improving effect on motor coordination (P 0.001, P 0.01) but with 15 mg/kg dose didn't have any effect on motor coordination. Conclusion: Our results suggest that folic acid may improve both short- and long-term memories, dose dependently, although it affects motor balance at lower dose.

103,2021,18843658,"Background: Folate deficiency can result in congenital neural tube defects and megaloblastic anaemia. Low folate levels may be due to insufficient dietary intake or inefficient absorption, but impaired metabolic utilization also occurs.Because B12 deficiency can produce a similar anaemia to folate deficiency, there is a risk that folate supplementation can delay the diagnosis of B12 deficiency, which can cause irreversible neurological damage. Folic acid supplements may sometimes therefore include vitamin B12 supplements with simultaneous administration of vitamin B12.Lesser degrees of folate inadequacy are associated with high blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine which has been linked with the risk of arterial disease, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. There is therefore interest in whether dietary supplementation can improve cognitive function in the elderly.However, any apparent benefit from folic acid which was given in combination with B12 needs to be ""corrected"" for any effect of vitamin B12 alone.

This Register contains references from all major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases. In addition MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO and LILACS were searched (years 2003-2007) for additional trials of folate with or without vitamin B12 on healthy elderly people. Selection criteria: All double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials, in which supplements of folic acid with or without vitamin B12 were compared with placebo for elderly healthy people or people with any type of dementia or cognitive impairment. Data collection and analysis: The reviewers independently applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality. One reviewer extracted and analysed the data. In comparing intervention with placebo, weighted mean differences and standardized mean difference or odds ratios were estimated. Main results: Eight randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. Four trials enrolled healthy older people, and four recruited participants with mild to moderate cognitive impairment or dementia with or without diagnosed folate deficiency. Pooling the data was not possible owing to heterogeneity in sample selections, outcomes, trial duration, and dosage. Two studies involved a combination of folic acid and vitamin B12.There is no adequate evidence of benefit from folic acid supplementation with or without vitamin B12 on cognitive function and mood of unselected healthy elderly people. However, in one trial enrolling a selected group of healthy elderly people with high homocysteine levels, 800 mcg/day folic acid supplementation over three years was associated with significant benefit in terms of global functioning (WMD 0.05, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.096, P = 0.033); memory storage (WMD 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.24, P = 0.006) and information-processing speed (WMD 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16, P = 0.016).Four trials involved people with cognitive impairment. In one pilot trial enrolling people with Alzheimer's disease, the overall response to cholinesterase inhibitors significantly improved with folic acid at a dose of 1mg/day (odds ratio: 4.06, 95% CI 1.22 to 13.53; P = 0.02) and there was a significant improvement in scores on the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and the Social Behaviour subscale of the Nurse's Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients (WMD 4.01, 95% CI 0.50 to 7.52, P = 0.02). Other trials involving people with cognitive impairment did not show any benefit in measures of cognitive function from folic acid, with or without vitamin B12.Folic acid plus vitamin B12 was effective in reducing serum homocysteine concentrations (WMD -5.90, 95% CI -8.43 to -3.37, P 0.00001). Folic acid was well tolerated and no adverse effects were reported. Authors' conclusions: The small number of studies which have been done provide no consistent evidence either way that folic acid, with or without vitamin B12, has a beneficial effect on cognitive function of unselected healthy or cognitively impaired older people. In a preliminary study, folic acid was associated with improvement in the response of people with Alzheimer's disease to cholinesterase inhibitors.

104,2021,12361440,"Objective: To determine if application of duct tape is as effective as cryotherapy in the treatment of common warts. Design: A prospective, randomized controlled trial with 2 treatment arms for warts in children. Setting: The general pediatric and adolescent clinics at a military medical center. Patients: A total of 61 patients (age range, 3-22 years) were enrolled in the study from October 31, 2000, to July 25, 2001; 51 patients completed the study and were available for analysis. Intervention: Patients were randomized using computer-generated codes to receive either cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen applied to each wart for 10 seconds every 2-3 weeks) for a maximum of 6 treatments or duct tape occlusion (applied directly to the wart) for a maximum of 2 months. Patients had their warts measured at baseline and with return visits. Main outcome measure: Complete resolution of the wart being studied. Results: Of the 51 patients completing the study, 26 (51%) were treated with duct tape, and 25 (49%) were treated with cryotherapy. Twenty-two patients (85%) in the duct tape arm vs 15 patients (60%) enrolled in the cryotherapy arm had complete resolution of their warts (P =.05 by chi(2) analysis). The majority of warts that responded to either therapy did so within the first month of treatment.

The objective of the current study is to assess the therapeutic effect of duct tape occlusion in comparison to cryotherapy in treatment of plantar warts in adults, in a prospective comparative randomized non-inferiority design. A total of 100 patients presenting with plantar warts were divided into two equal groups. First group was treated with silver duct tape occlusion for up to 8 weeks or disappearance of warts, whichever occurred first. Second group was treated with cryotherapy every 2 to 3 weeks for a maximum of four sessions or disappearance of warts. There was a statistically significant lower rate of complete resolution in duct tape than cryotherapy group (20% vs 58%, P = .0001, respectively). Degree of response to treatment in the duct tape and cryotherapy groups was not correlated to patients' age (P = .361 and .334, respectively) or disease duration (P = .266 and .285, respectively), while there was a statistically significant inverse relationship between the number (P = .0032 and .001, respectively) and diameter of warts (P = .013 and .003, respectively) and the degree of response in the two studied groups.

The advice was subsequently examined to determine if it was evidence-based. Results: Our study has demonstrated inconsistencies in the content of the first aid advice provided by the 21 organisations included in the study. Seventy-one percent of the information was only available online. The temperature, method and duration of cooling varied substantially, as did the advice recommended for the removal of clothing and jewellery and methods for covering the burn immediately after injury. Results from the literature review concluded the following based on available evidence; cool the burn with running tap water for 20min, remove clothing and jewellery and cover the burn with cling film or a clean non-adhesive dressing.

105,2021,17470011,"Background: Cryotherapy (e.g., ice pack) is prescribed commonly after oral surgery to inhibit swelling and discomfort. However, there is a dearth of data concerning various aspects of cold therapy: optimal delivery mode, best interval for application (time on/time off), and total duration of treatment to attain desired clinical outcomes. Methods: The literature was searched for clinical trials that assessed the benefits of cryotherapy after oral surgical procedures. In addition, other studies were reviewed that evaluated physiological responses to cold therapy. Results: To inhibit signs of inflammation and achieve beneficial results with cryotherapy, skin temperature (normally 33 degrees C) needs to be reduced to 10 degrees C to 15 degrees C. Cold therapy usually decreased skin temperature to 10 degrees C to 15 degrees C within 10 to 20 minutes. Physiological studies indicated cryotherapy resulted in vasoconstriction, reduction of edema, and diminished pain perception. Various methods can be used to lower tissue temperature. Ice or gel packs are easy and efficient techniques to cool tissues. Seven studies published in English were found that addressed the use of cryotherapy after oral surgical procedures. Five investigations demonstrated no clinical benefits from cold therapy, and two studies indicated that cryotherapy reduced post-surgical edema and pain. The time interval for cold applications varied in different studies (10 minutes to continuous for hours). There seemed to be consensus among clinicians that cryotherapy should be applied for 10 to 20 minutes followed by a rest period. The duration of therapy ranged from 2 to 72 hours. No clinical trials were conducted to determine the optimal interval of cold application (time on/off) or extended duration of cryotherapy after surgical procedures to attain the best therapeutic benefits. Conclusions: Ice applied after surgical procedures may reduce swelling and discomfort. However, data from studies regarding the benefits of ice therapy after oral surgery are inconclusive.

One hundred patients with vitiligo were treated with oral folic acid and vitamin B12 after being informed that sun exposure might enhance repigmentation. They were requested to keep a record of sun exposure in summer and UVB irradiation in winter. The minimal treatment time suggested was 3-6 months but should be longer if improvement was achieved. Clear repigmentation occurred in 52 patients, including 37 who exposed their skin to summer sun and 6 who used UVB lamps in winter. Repigmentation was most evident on sun-exposed areas, where 38% of the patients had previously noted repigmentation during summer months. Total repigmentation was seen in 6 patients. The spread of vitiligo stopped in 64% of the patients after treatment. Folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation combined with sun exposure can induce repigmentation better than either the vitamins or sun exposure alone.

106,2021,31908514,"Introduction: Vitiligo is one of the most common hypomelanoses. Current treatments include ultraviolet, topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors. Orally administered vitamins, acting as anti-oxidants and in combination with ultraviolet light have also demonstrated skin re-pigmentation. In our pilot study of seven patients, we injected skin affected with vitiligo intra-dermally with a complex of vitamins and minerals and assessed the outcome. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate a novel treatment modality for vitiligo. Methods: We present a pilot study of seven patients; each having been diagnosed with generalized progressive vitiligo. In all cases, multiple therapies had been previously attempted. All patients were subjected to intradermal injections of biorevitalizant NCTF 135 (3 mls) in the hypo-pigmented areas of skin, once a week for 5 weeks. A 30Gx13 mm needle was used for the 0.025 mls intradermal injections to create micro-papules with a 1 cm distance between the injection sites. The results were assessed at 2 weeks and 5 weeks and were considered successful if partial or complete repigmentation was achieved. Results: Partial or complete skin re-pigmentation post-treatment was observed in vitiligo macules of all patients (100%). No significant side effects, or exacerbation of vitiligo were observed during or after treatment with NCTF 135 in the following 6 months (five patients) and 12 months (two patients). Discussion: Increasing the armamentarium of new treatments of vitiligo is important. Previous studies showed the effectiveness of oral and intramuscularly injected multivitamins in the treatment of vitiligo, explaining the results by the antioxidative qualities of the above. Our study demonstrated that intradermal mesotherapy injections of NCTF135, rich with vitamins and other antioxidants are well tolerated and effective in achieving significant re-pigmentation of de-pigmented skin in all patients studied, including five who had been resistant to previous standard therapies.",Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo?,vitamin b12 sun exposure vitiligo,1.0,Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo?,0.8631160855293274

Patients/methods: Literature review of last 15 years was made using the terms ""diet in dermatology,"" ""nutrition and skin,"" ""nutritional supplements in dermatology,"" ""nutritional agents and acne,"" ""nutritional agents and alopecia,"" and ""nutritional agents and psoriasis."" Results: While there are multiple publications on the use of nutritional supplements for amelioration of skin diseases, most of them are based on either associations or in vitro studies, but very few transcend the rigors of a clinical trial or the holey grail of a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. There seem to be some evidence in acne, psoriasis, telogen effluvium, urticaria &amp; vitiligo. Coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis have a strong link with diet. Rosacea has a strong link with certain foods, but the other disorders like melasma, aphthous stomatitis do not have any scientifically validated association with diet. Conclusions: Our updated review examines the role of nutritional supplements and antioxidants in various dermatological disorders. We have found that there are varying levels of evidence with notable associations of low glycemic diet &amp; acne, fish oil &amp; weight loss with psoriasis, fish oils &amp; probiotics with atopic dermatitis &amp; vitamins &amp; botanical extracts with vitiligo.

Relative deficiency of folic acid may occur in conditions such as pregnancy and hyperproliferative or chronic inflammatory disorders. Folic acid supplementation has been proven to be beneficial in the prevention of neural tube defects and in limiting methotrexate side effects, and may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Folate is a critical vitamin in determining plasma homocysteine levels, which in turn is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The results of large clinical trials with dietary supplementation of folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 have shown that this homocysteine-lowering therapy is effective in the secondary prevention of non-fatal strokes, but had no effect in the prevention of fatal cardiovascular diseases. Hyperhomocysteinemia has also been reported in age-related neurological conditions with cognitive impairment (e.g. dementia), and psychiatric disorders such as depression. Elevated homocysteine levels are frequent in patients with chronic immune-mediated disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, which have in common a tendency to an accelerated atherosclerosis leading to increased deaths from cardiovascular events.

Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze the levels autoantibodies, basal glycaemia, vitamin B12, folic acid and thyroid function and its association with the diagnosis and outcome of vitiligo patients through a case-control study. Material and methods: This case-control study was performed on 196 consecutive patients with vitiligo referred to our Dermatology Department. As a control group, 160 healthy individuals without vitiligo or known history of immunologic/endocrine disease were included. Data were analyzed using the SPSS 17.0 statistical software package. Results: Clinical, analytical and demographic data have been recorded. Our results showed that anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody and anti-parietal gastric cell antibody could be useful laboratory markers in a subpopulation of vitiligo patients. However, testing anti-nuclear antibody, anti-thyroglobulin antibody, folic acid and vitamin B12 seems to have limited clinical implication and diagnostic relevance in our routine clinical practice. Limitations: This study addressed a selected population of vitiligo patients in Spain and may not generalize to different clinical settings or regions. The study of a wider sample would confirm these findings and allow a detailed analysis of the above factors as a function of the clinical subtype of vitiligo. Conclusion: We have determined the more efficient serological markers to order in vitiligo patients. Our findings suggest that anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody and anti-parietal gastric cell could be useful tests for the characterization of specific subpopulations of vitiligo patients in terms of severity and co-morbidity, so their determination could have a prognostic value.",Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo?,vitamin b12 sun exposure vitiligo,1.0,Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo?,0.8356543779373169
106,2021,16426381,"Background: While oral psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) remains the most popular therapeutic modality for vitiligo, recent reports have shown that narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) also induces significant repigmentation. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of broadband UVB on actively spreading, progressive vitiligo in patients who had been followed for many months (12 or more) in our practice, who continued to depigment despite treatment. Methods: Nine patients with actively spreading vitiligo were exposed to broadband UVB 2-3 times per week at a starting dose of 20-30 mJ/cm(2). Radiation was increased by 10-20 mJ/cm(2) per session with adjustments for symptomatic erythema or missed visits. In addition, patients took vitamin C 500 mg twice a day (BID), vitamin B(12) 1000 microg BID and folic acid 5 mg BID. The response to treatment and side-effects were assessed at each visit. The patient's response to treatment and progress were assessed by photographs and by physician evaluation of body surface area (BSA) (using the Rule of 9s) involved at monthly intervals. Photographs were taken and estimations of BSA by physical examination made at the start and finish of the trial and then compared by the physicians involved in the study. Results: Broadband UVB halted the progression of vitiligo in all nine patients and in general induced repigmentation early after 8-12 treatments (6-8 weeks). After 2-8 months of treatment, nine of nine patients achieved good (51-75%) or excellent response (76-100%). The percentage of repigmentation varied with length of treatment and anatomic site. Conclusions: This study confirms the only published report that broadband UVB is effective on actively spreading vitiligo. Since it is more cost effective than narrowband UVB and has numerous advantages compared to oral PUVA, broadband UVB may offer an alternative for future treatment of vitiligo.

107,2021,19643002,"Background: There is a substantial body of evidence on the efficacy of yoga in the management of bronchial asthma. Many studies have reported, as the effects of yoga on bronchial asthma, significant improvements in pulmonary functions, quality of life and reduction in airway hyper-reactivity, frequency of attacks and medication use. In addition, a few studies have attempted to understand the effects of yoga on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) or exercise tolerance capacity. However, none of these studies has investigated any immunological mechanisms by which yoga improves these variables in bronchial asthma. Methods: The present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted on 57 adult subjects with mild or moderate bronchial asthma who were allocated randomly to either the yoga (intervention) group (n = 29) or the wait-listed control group (n = 28). The control group received only conventional care and the yoga group received an intervention based on yoga, in addition to the conventional care. The intervention consisted of 2-wk supervised training in lifestyle modification and stress management based on yoga followed by closely monitored continuation of the practices at home for 6-wk. The outcome measures were assessed in both the groups at 0 wk (baseline), 2, 4 and 8 wk by using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) repeated measures followed by post-hoc analysis. Results: In the yoga group, there was a steady and progressive improvement in pulmonary function, the change being statistically significant in case of the first second of forced expiratory volume (FEV1) at 8 wk, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at 2, 4 and 8 wk as compared to the corresponding baseline values. There was a significant reduction in EIB in the yoga group. However, there was no corresponding reduction in the urinary prostaglandin D2 metabolite (11beta prostaglandin F2alpha) levels in response to the exercise challenge. There was also no significant change in serum eosinophilic cationic protein levels during the 8-wk study period in either group. There was a significant improvement in Asthma Quality of Life (AQOL) scores in both groups over the 8-wk study period. But the improvement was achieved earlier and was more complete in the yoga group. The number-needed-to-treat worked out to be 1.82 for the total AQOL score. An improvement in total AQOL score was greater than the minimal important difference and the same outcome was achieved for the sub-domains of the AQOL. The frequency of rescue medication use showed a significant decrease over the study period in both the groups. However, the decrease was achieved relatively earlier and was more marked in the yoga group than in the control group. Conclusion: The present RCT has demonstrated that adding the mind-body approach of yoga to the predominantly physical approach of conventional care results in measurable improvement in subjective as well as objective outcomes in bronchial asthma. The trial supports the efficacy of yoga in the management of bronchial asthma.

107,2021,33625666,"Objective: To assess the effect of yoga on control of asthma in children with bronchial asthma. Methods: This hospital-based interventional randomized controlled trial conducted in the Department of Pediatrics at a tertiary care center of North India from November 2017 to October 2018 enrolled 140 newly diagnosed cases of asthma of age 10-16 y who were randomly divided into two groups. Seventy children in the case group practiced yoga under supervision for a period of 3 mo in addition to pharmacological treatment. Seventy controls received only pharmacological treatment. Pulmonary-function tests were done at baseline, 6 wk, and 12 wk along with quality of life (QOL) assessment by Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ). The outcome measures assessed were forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). QOL evaluation was done in 3 domains: activity limitation, symptoms, and emotional function. Results: The asthmatic children practicing yoga have shown significant improvement in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and PEFR which was better as compared to controls. Improvement was also noted in mean-PAQLQ score in cases which was statistically significantly better as compared to controls. Conclusion: Yoga appears to have significant positive effect on control of asthma measured by pulmonary-function test and QOL.

107,2021,11828038,"Background: Sahaja Yoga is a traditional system of meditation based on yogic principles which may be used for therapeutic purposes. A study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of this therapy as an adjunctive tool in the management of asthma in adult patients who remained symptomatic on moderate to high doses of inhaled steroids. Methods: A parallel group, double blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted. Subjects were randomly allocated to Sahaja yoga and control intervention groups. Both the yoga and the control interventions required the subjects to attend a 2 hour session once a week for 4 months. Asthma related quality of life (AQLQ, range 0-4), Profile of Mood States (POMS), level of airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (AHR), and a diary card based combined asthma score (CAS, range 0-12) reflecting symptoms, bronchodilator usage, and peak expiratory flow rates were measured at the end of the treatment period and again 2 months later. Results: Twenty one of 30 subjects randomised to the yoga intervention and 26 of 29 subjects randomised to the control group were available for assessment at the end of treatment. The improvement in AHR at the end of treatment was 1.5 doubling doses (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0 to 2.9, p=0.047) greater in the yoga intervention group than in the control group. Differences in AQLQ score (0.41, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.86) and CAS (0.9, 95% CI -0.9 to 2.7) were not significant (p&gt;0.05).

107,2021,36008210,"Asthma presents a global problem to health of high prevalence; often life-long, typical onset in late teenage years, and no hope of reversal. Also, problems of long-term management with drugs present patients with endless suffering: poor quality of life due to reduced pulmonary function and associated psychological problems. There is thus great need for more effective management, and identification of any possible route to cure. Yoga therapy offers a promising alternative. Studies of specially designed yoga protocols over the past 40 years have shown benefits for all the above problem areas. However, challenges have led to high dropout levels. Some postures may have been too difficult for all to perform, while overall yoga modules may have required too much time for all patients to practice regularly. Despite patients with asthma feeling that Yoga brings benefits, few have practiced it with enough persistence to gain control of their condition. This short communication summarizes two recent papers describing, (a) the development of a short, easy to practise yoga module, and (b) assessment of its efficacy in all three areas by a 90-day randomized control trial. The module's five carefully selected components include four breathing practices and a relaxation exercise, which could be done by anyone, even those new to yoga. Popularity with participants led to zero dropouts, while its efficacy proved extremely high in all areas assessed.

The chronic inflammation causes an associated increase in airway hyperresponsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing at night or in the early morning. Most of the studies have reported, as the effects of yoga on bronchial asthma, significant improvements in pulmonary functions, quality of life, and decrease in medication use, but none of the studies has attempted to show the effect of yoga on biochemical changes. Objective: To evaluate the effect of yoga on biochemical profile of asthmatics. Materials and methods: In the present study, 276 patients of mild to moderate asthma (FEV 1&gt; 60%) aged between 12 to 60 years were recruited from the Department of Pulmonary Medicine, King George's Medical University, U.P., Lucknow, India. They were randomly divided into two groups: Yoga group (with standard medical treatment and yogic intervention) and control group as standard medical treatment (without yogic intervention). At completion of 6 months of the study period, 35 subjects were dropped out, so out of 276 subjects, only 241 subjects completed the whole study (121 subjects from yoga group and 120 subjects from control group). Biochemical assessment was carried out at baseline and after 6 months of the study period. Results: In yoga group, there was significant improvement found in the proportion of hemoglobin and antioxidant superoxide dismutase in comparison to control group and significant decrease was found in total leukocyte count (TLC) and differential leukocytes count in comparison to control group. There was no significant change found in TLC, polymorphs, and monocytes in between group comparison.

108,2021,15823688,"Anorexia is a common symptom accompanying infections, but the teleology of the phenomenon remains unexplained. We hypothesize that anorexia may represent a prehistoric behavioral adaptation to fight infection by maintaining T helper (Th)2 bias, which is particularly vital in fighting bacterial pathogens. Specifically, we propose that anorexia may avert the reduction of Th2/Th1 ratio by preventing feeding-induced neurohormonal and vagal output from the gut. Emerging evidence suggests that the vagal and neurohormonal output of the gut during feeding promotes Th1 function, which is desirable in fighting viral infections. Since fever may be an adaptation to fight bacteria and ""colds"" are generally viral in origin, the adage ""starve a fever and feed a cold"" may reflect a sensible behavioral strategy to tilt autonomic and Th balance in directions that are optimal for fighting the particular type of infection. The ability to modulate T helper balance through the neurohormonal and autonomic axis by adjusting food intake may be the mechanism behind other unexplained clinical observations such as the improved outcomes of ICU patients after enteric versus parenteric feedings. Compared to the prehistoric period when bacterial infection was commonplace, the anorexic response may be less adaptive today when viruses and cancers have become common triggers of anorexia. By promoting host anorexia, cachexia, and insomnia, cancers and viruses can deter behaviors such as digestion and sleep that would raise vagal and Th1 activity against tumors and viruses. Hydration and sleep, unexplained but widely accepted recommendations for flu patients, may also work by promoting vagal and Th1 functions. Modulating feeding, hydration, and sleep may prove beneficial in treating other conditions associated with abnormal autonomic and Th balance.",Is starving a fever effective?,"starve a fever, feed a cold",0.0,Is starving a fever effective?,0.9348986148834229

Summary background data: Fever is a protective acute-phase response to infection. However, in critically ill patients, the harmful effects of fever seem to be predominant. Critical illness is frequently associated with reduced plasma glutamine (Gln) levels, which contribute to the immune suppression in these patients due to impaired monocyte function. Methods: Isolated monocytes were suspended in Gln-depleted medium and exposed to 41 degrees C. Cell survival was determined by an MTT-based assay, and phagocytosis of Escherichia coli was measured by flow cytometry. Expression of Hsp70 was determined by Western blot. Results: Hyperthermia for 300 minutes strongly decreased the viability of Gln-depleted monocytes (85%), whereas it had only a moderate effect on Gln-supplied cells (45%, P 0.05). Shorter treatments (45 minutes) of Gln-starving monocytes had almost no effects on viability but decreased the phagocytosis activity by 30.8%. In addition, the expression of Hsp70 was inhibited almost completely. Conclusion: These data show that Gln-starving monocytes have a reduced thermoresistance. This suggests that elevated body temperature damages monocytes in critically ill patients with reduced plasma Gln-levels possibly via an inhibition of the cytoprotective protein Hsp70.",Is starving a fever effective?,"starve a fever, feed a cold",0.0,Is starving a fever effective?,0.0036444365978240967

108,2021,18710488,"Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate a simple diagnostic test for Gilbert's syndrome (GS), which avoids hospitalization and exposure to toxic test substrates. GS is the most frequent cause of isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The nicotinic acid test and the starving test are established approaches to diagnose GS. However, these tests cause considerable side effects or require hospital admission. In single GS patients, we observed rapid serum bilirubin normalization after a standard European lunch (the ""inverse starving test""). Findings: At two consecutive days, 18 profoundly characterized GS patients (7 females, 11 males, median age 34.5 years, range 21-58 years) were investigated with the nicotinic acid test and the inverse starving test. Unconjugated serum bilirubin (UCB) levels were measured before and hourly up to four hours after lunch (median 645 kcal), and after the ingestion of 170 milligrams nicotinic acid, respectively. Patients who consulted their physicians with jaundice were significantly more likely to undergo invasive diagnostic procedures than patients with an incidental finding of elevated UCB, despite UCB levels were indifferent in both groups. Two hours after nicotinic acid ingestion, relative UCB exceeded 1.7 fold the fasting levels (median, range 0.9-2.4 fold, sensitivity 83%). In the inverse starving test, UCB remained almost unchanged three hours after lunch (median 1.0; range: 0.8-1.2 fold). Molecular analysis established the genotype of the TATAA box of the UGT1A1 gene; all patients carried an UGT1A1 promotor polymorphism. Conclusion: The inverse starving test is not an appropriate provocation test for patients with suspected GS. The 100% prevalence of the UGT1A1 polymorphism in our cohort underlines that the diagnosis of GS may be substantiated with this simple molecular test in patients with an uncertain diagnosis of GS.",Is starving a fever effective?,"starve a fever, feed a cold",0.0,Is starving a fever effective?,0.5595954060554504

109,2021,29775743,"The cancer-preventive mechanism of selenium should address the way low concentrations of selenometabolites react with cellular targets without being diffused from the sites of generation, the way selenium selectively kills tumor cells, and the intriguing U-shaped curve that is seen with dietary supplementation of selenium and cancer prevention. Protein kinase C (PKC), a receptor for tumor promoters, is well suited for this mechanism. Due to the catalytic redox cycle, low concentrations of methylselenol, a postulated active metabolite of selenium, react with the tumor-promoting lipid hydroperoxide bound to PKC to form methylseleninic acid (MSA), which selectively reacts with thiol residues present within the vicinity of the PKC catalytic domain to inactivate it. Given that lipid hydroperoxide levels are high in promoting cells, PKC inactivation selectively leads to death in these cells. A biphasic effect of MSA in inducing cell death was observed in certain prostate cancer cell lines; lower concentrations of MSA induced cell death, while higher concentrations failed to do so. Lower concentrations of selenium inactivate more sensitive antiapoptotic isoenzymes of PKC (ε and α), sparing less sensitive proapoptotic isoenzymes (PKCδ and PKCζ). Higher concentrations of selenium also inactivate proapoptotic isoenzymes and consequently make tumor cells resistant to apoptosis. Due to a high-affinity binding of thioredoxin to the PKC catalytic domain, this thiol oxidation is explicitly reversed by thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD), a selenoprotein. Therefore, overexpression of TXNRD in advanced tumor cells could make them resistant to selenium-induced death.

Aim of the review: To review different aspects on selenium metabolism, the occurrence of different selenoproteins and their use as biomarkers of selenium status, the results of intervention trials of the cancer-preventive effects of selenium supplementation, the mechanisms of action involved, together with epidemiological findings on relations between the selenium status in the body and risk of cancer. Results and conclusions: The rapid advance in the knowledge of different selenoproteins and their biological functions has opened up new possibilities for the understanding of the biological effects of selenium supplementation. A wide variety of effects of different forms and doses of selenium has been observed in a number of experimental systems, and it is at present difficult to pinpoint the mechanism that may explain the positive preventive effects of selenium supplementation observed in some human long-term trials.

Materials and methods: Published epidemiological and scientific studies relating to the potential clinical and molecular role of selenium in preventing cancer are reviewed and summarized. A unifying hypothesis underlying observations on the effect of selenium on early events in carcinogenesis is presented. Results: A large body of epidemiological evidence, including observational, case-control, cohort and randomized controlled clinical trials, support the proposition that selenium may prevent prostate cancer in humans. The available data suggest a beneficial effect for men with low baseline serum or toenail selenium levels, without preexisting tumors, with serum prostate specific antigen less than 4 ng/ml and in current or former smokers. Molecular data demonstrate that selenium prevents clonal expansion of nascent tumors by causing cell cycle arrest, promoting apoptosis, and modulating p53 dependent DNA repair mechanisms.

109,2021,26833775,"Epidemiological and laboratory data support the protective effects of bioactive nutrients in our diets for various diseases. Along with various factors, such as genetic history, alcohol, smoking, exercise, and dietary choices play a vital role in affecting an individual's immune responses toward a transforming cell, by either preventing or accelerating a neoplastic transformation. Ample evidence suggests that dietary nutrients control the inflammatory and protumorigenic responses in immune cells. Immunoprevention is usually associated with the modulation of immune responses that help in resolving the inflammation, thus improving clinical outcome. Various metabolic pathway-related nutrients, including glutamine, arginine, vitamins, minerals, and long-chain fatty acids, are important components of immunonutrient mixes. Epidemiological studies related to these substances have reported different results, with no or minimal effects. However, several studies suggest that these nutrients may have immune-modulating effects that may lower cancer risk. Preclinical studies submit that most of these components may provide beneficial effects. The present review discusses the available data, the immune-modulating functions of these nutrients, and how these substances could be used to study immune modulation in a neoplastic environment.

We made a narrative summary of data from RCTs. Main results: We included 49 prospective observational studies and six RCTs. In epidemiologic data, we found a reduced cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.91) and mortality (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.83) with higher selenium exposure. Cancer risk was more pronouncedly reduced in men (incidence: OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05) than in women (incidence: OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77). These findings have potential limitations due to study design, quality and heterogeneity of the data, which complicated the interpretation of the summary statistics.The RCTs found no protective efficacy of selenium yeast supplementation against non-melanoma skin cancer or L-selenomethionine supplementation against prostate cancer. Study results for the prevention of liver cancer with selenium supplements were inconsistent and studies had an unclear risk of bias. The results of the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial (NPCT) and SELECT raised concerns about possible harmful effects of selenium supplements. Authors' conclusions: No reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding a causal relationship between low selenium exposure and an increased risk of cancer. Despite evidence for an inverse association between selenium exposure and the risk of some types of cancer, these results should be interpreted with care due to the potential limiting factors of heterogeneity and influences of unknown biases, confounding and effect modification.The effect of selenium supplementation from RCTs yielded inconsistent results.

109,2021,32414091,"Selenium (Se) is an essential trace nutrient required for optimal human health. It has long been suggested that selenium has anti-cancer properties. However, clinical trials have shown inconclusive results on the potential of Se to prevent cancer. The suggested role of Se in the prevention of cancer is centered around its role as an antioxidant. Recently, the potential of selenium as a drug rather than a supplement has been uncovered. Selenium compounds can generate reactive oxygen species that could enhance the treatment of cancer. Transformed cells have high oxidative distress. As normal cells have a greater capacity to meet oxidative challenges than tumor cells, increasing the flux of oxidants with high dose selenium treatment could result in cancer-specific cell killing. If the availability of Se is limited, supplementation of Se can increase the expression and activities of Se-dependent proteins and enzymes. In cell culture, selenium deficiency is often overlooked. We review the importance of achieving normal selenium biology and how Se deficiency can lead to adverse effects. We examine the vital role of selenium in the prevention and treatment of cancer. Finally, we examine the properties of Se-compounds to better understand how each can be used to address different research questions.",Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,0.7684347033500671
109,2021,29795790,"Although several experimental studies showed cancer-preventive efficacy of supplemental dietary selenium, human clinical trials questioned this efficacy. Identifying its molecular targets and mechanism is important in understanding this discrepancy. Methylselenol, the active metabolite of selenium, reacts with lipid hydroperoxides bound to protein kinase C (PKC) and is oxidized to methylseleninic acid (MSA). This locally generated MSA selectively inactivates PKC by oxidizing its critical cysteine sulfhydryls. The peroxidatic redox cycle occurring in this process may explain how extremely low concentrations of selenium catalytically modify specific membrane-bound proteins compartmentally separated from glutathione and selectively induce cytotoxicity in promoting cells. Mammalian thioredoxin reductase (TR) is itself a selenoenzyme with a catalytic selenocysteine residue. Together with thioredoxin (Trx), it catalyzes reduction of selenite and selenocystine by NADPH generating selenide which in the presence of oxygen redox cycles producing reactive oxygen species. Trx binds with high affinity to PKC and reverses PKC inactivation. Therefore, established tumor cells overexpressing TR and Trx may escape the cancer-preventive actions of selenium. This suggests that in some cases, certain selenoproteins may counteract selenometabolite actions. Lower concentrations of selenium readily inactivate antiapoptotic PKC isoenzymes e and a which have a cluster of vicinal thiols, thereby inducing apoptosis. Higher concentrations of selenium also inactivate proapoptotic enzymes such as proteolytically activated PKCd fragment, holo-PKCz, caspase-3, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which all have a limited number of critical cysteine residues and make tumor cells resistant to selenium-induced apoptosis. This may explain the intriguing U-shaped curve that is seen with dietary selenium intake and the extent of cancer prevention.",Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,0.918216347694397

It is commonly seen in women aged 25 to 45, with an incidence of approximately 10%-15%. Case summary: A 35-year-old unmarried female who denied a history of sex with an intact hymen had multiple dysmenorrhea and pain in the left lower abdomen that recurred during menstruation. Ultrasound examination revealed a dark cystic area measuring 4.9 cm × 4.6 cm on the left side with poor light transmittance, which suggested a left endometriotic cyst. The patient was treated with pain medications (four capsules t.i.d., p.o.). After one month, computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a low-density focus measuring approximately 38 mm in diameter, a blurred mesentery fat plane in the pelvic cavity, and pelvic effusion. Ultrasound showed a complex echo density measuring 5.2 cm × 3.0 cm × 4.2 cm in the left ovarian area and a fluid sonolucent area with a depth of 2.0 cm in the pelvic cavity. Left ovarian cystectomy, electrocautery for endometriotic lesions, myomectomy, and pelvic adhesion lysis were performed under laparoscopy.

110,2021,15898819,"Extended use of oral contraceptive (OC) pills can successfully suppress endometrial activity and prevent menstruation for several months. Given that missed menses in women not using hormonal contraception may be of medical concern, understanding how hormonal contraceptives eliminate these concerns is important for both patient and healthcare provider acceptance. OC withdrawal bleeding is an artificial, iatrogenic event, which results from the deliberate, periodic interruption of hormonal support of the endometrium. Historically, it was important to provide periodic bleeding to reassure OC efficacy, but today it is recognized that these bleeding episodes are medically unnecessary and cause patient discomfort and out-of-pocket expenses. Decades of experience with prolonged use of OCs have been accumulated for women with specific menstrual-related problems such as endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and menstrual migraine headaches. Today there is a US FDA-approved product to routinely reduce the number of withdrawal periods. Clinical trials show that there is an initial increase in unscheduled bleeding and spotting days with extended-cycle OC use, but an absolute decrease in total days of bleeding and spotting from the first cycle of use. Over time, unscheduled bleeding and spotting decreases to rates found with the use of conventional-cycle regimens.

110,2021,25189423,"Purpose: Menstrual pain is associated with increased production of inflammatory molecules, such as prostaglandins. Inflammation is involved in pathogenesis of several cancers, including ovarian cancer. In this study, we examined the association between menstrual pain and risk of ovarian cancer. Methods: We conducted a case-control study with 2,028 cases of epithelial ovarian cancer and 2,091 age- and study center-matched controls. Women were asked to report the severity of menstrual pain during their twenties and thirties, when not using oral contraceptives or breastfeeding. We used an unconditional logistic regression to evaluate the association between menstrual pain and epithelial ovarian cancer risk overall, and polytomous logistic regression to evaluate whether the association differed across tumor subtypes. Results: Risk of ovarian cancer was increased in women with moderate (OR 1.22, 95 % CI 1.05-1.42) and severe pain (OR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.09-1.65) compared to women with no or mild pain during menstrual period. The association differed by histologic subtypes, with significant associations for severe pain with endometrioid (OR 1.64, 95 % CI 1.15-2.34) and clear cell tumors (OR 1.91, 95 % CI 1.11-3.28).

Clinicians prescribing anticoagulants must counsel patients on issues ranging from menstruation and the possibility of developing a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst to teratogenic risks and safety with breastfeeding. Abnormal uterine bleeding affects up to 70% of young women who are treated with anticoagulation. As such, thoughtful clinical guidance is required to avoid having young women who are troubled by their menses, dose reduce, or prematurely discontinue their anticoagulation, leaving them at increased risk of recurrent thrombosis. Informed by a review of the medical literature, we present current recommendations for assisting patients requiring anticoagulation with menstrual management, prevention of hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, and avoiding unintended pregnancy. The subdermal implant may be considered a first-line option for those requiring anticoagulation, given its superior contraceptive effectiveness and ability to reliably reduce risk of hemorrhagic ovarian cysts. All progestin-only formulations-such as the subdermal implant, intrauterine device, injection, or pills-are generally preferred over combined hormonal pills, patch, or ring. Tranexamic acid, and in rare cases endometrial ablation, may also be useful in managing menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea. During pregnancy, enoxaparin remains the preferred anticoagulant and warfarin is contraindicated. Breastfeeding women may use warfarin, but direct oral anticoagulants are not recommended given their limited safety data.

Objective: We studied whether maternal zinc supplementation improved the zinc status of mothers and neonates participating in a supplementation trial in a shantytown in Lima, Peru. Design: Beginning at gestation week 10-24, 1295 mothers were randomly assigned to receive prenatal supplements containing 60 mg Fe and 250 microg folate, with or without 15 mg Zn. Venous blood and urine samples were collected at enrollment, at gestation week 28-30, and at gestation week 37-38. At birth, a sample of cord vein blood was collected. We measured serum zinc concentrations in 538 women, urinary zinc concentrations in 521 women, and cord zinc concentrations in 252 neonates. Results: At 28-30 and 37-38 wk, mothers receiving zinc supplements had higher serum zinc concentrations than mothers who did not receive zinc (8.8 +/- 1.9 compared with 8.4 +/- 1.5 micromol/L and 8.6 +/- 1.5 compared with 8.3 +/- 1.4 micromol/L, respectively).

To date, placebo-controlled trials have all been performed in industrialized countries and the results are inconsistent. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether zinc supplementation in Bangladeshi urban poor during the last 2 trimesters of pregnancy was associated with pregnancy outcome. Design: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 559 women from Dhaka slums, stratified by parity between 12 and 16 wk of gestation, were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg elemental Zn/d (n = 269) or placebo (n = 290). Supplementation continued until delivery. Serum zinc was estimated at baseline and at 7 mo of gestation. Dietary intake was assessed at baseline and anthropometric measurements were made monthly. Weight, length, and gestational ages of 410 singleton newborns were measured within 72 h of birth. Results: At 7 mo of gestation, serum zinc concentrations tended to be higher in the zinc-supplemented group than in the placebo group (15.9 +/- 4.4 compared with 15.2 +/- 4.3 micromol/L). No significant effect of treatment was observed on infant birth weight (2513 +/- 390 compared with 2554 +/- 393 g; NS) or on gestational age, infant length, or head, chest, or midupper arm circumference. The incidence and distribution of low birth weight, prematurity, and smallness for gestational age also did not differ significantly after zinc supplementation.

Objective: We examined the effects of zinc supplements on birth outcomes, hematologic indicators, and counts of T lymphocyte subsets among 400 HIV-infected pregnant women. Design: Eligible women between 12 and 27 wk of gestation were randomly assigned to daily oral supplementation with either 25 mg Zn or placebo between recruitment and 6 wk after delivery. All women received iron, folic acid, and multivitamin supplements irrespective of the experimental assignment. Results: We observed no significant differences in birth weight, duration of gestation, or fetal and neonatal mortality between women in the zinc and placebo groups.

The addition of zinc to IFA supplements had no significant impact on iron or zinc status. In conclusion, adding zinc to IFA supplements did not modify efficacy on iron status or improve zinc status, but daily supplementation was more efficacious than weekly in improving iron stores.",Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,zinc supplements pregnancy,0.0,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,0.00021201664640102535
111,2021,11297959,"Background: Infant malnutrition and mortality rates are high in less-developed countries especially in low-birthweight infants. Zinc deficiency is also widely prevalent in these circumstances. We aimed to assess the effect of daily zinc supplements given to pregnant mothers on their infants' growth and morbidity. Methods: We did a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial in 199 and 221 Bangladeshi infants whose mothers took 30 mg daily elemental zinc or placebo, respectively, from 12 to 16 weeks' gestation until delivery. Infants were followed up until 6 months of age. We obtained data for morbidity every week by mothers' recall. Infants' anthropometric measurements were done every month, and their serum zinc was assessed at 1 and 6 months of age. Findings: Infants of mothers who received zinc during pregnancy had at age 6 months reduced risks compared with those in the placebo group for acute diarrhoea (risk ratio 0.84; 95% CI 0.72-0.98), dysentery (0.36; 0.25-0.84), and impetigo (0.53; 0.34-0.82). These reductions were seen in low-birthweight infants but not in those with normal birthweight. There were no differences in infant growth or serum zinc concentrations between treatment groups. Interpretation: Maternal zinc supplementation during pregnancy resulted in a reduction of the health risks in Bangladeshi low-birthweight infants, although this intervention did not improve birthweight. Whether zinc should be added to usual antenatal supplements in regions with high rates of low birthweight should be reviewed.",Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,zinc supplements pregnancy,0.0,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,0.00026104674907401204
111,2021,31618430,"Background: Zinc and vitamin A supplementation have both been shown to affect iron status, hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, and anemia in animal and human studies. However, evidence on their combined use in pregnancy, in the context of iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation, remains limited. Objective: This study determined the effects of prenatal zinc, vitamin A, and iron supplementation on maternal hematologic and micronutrient status at delivery in Tanzania. Methods: We analyzed 2 large randomized controlled trials, using generalized estimating equations, and examined the effect of daily zinc (25 mg) and vitamin A (2500 IU) supplementation starting in the first trimester of pregnancy compared with placebo (n = 2500), and separately evaluated the safety and efficacy of daily iron (60 mg) supplementation among iron-replete pregnant women (n = 1500). Blood samples from baseline and delivery were tested for Hb, serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, plasma zinc, and zinc protoporphyrin. Results: Zinc and vitamin A supplementation were associated with lower Hb concentrations at delivery of -0.26 g/dL (95% CI: -0.50, -0.02 g/dL) and -0.25 g/dL (95% CI: -0.49, -0.01 g/dL), respectively. Vitamin A increased mean ferritin concentrations at delivery (14.3 μg/L, 95% CI: 1.84, 29.11 μg/L), but was associated with increased risk of severe anemia (RR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.88). Among women who were iron replete at baseline, iron supplementation reduced the risk of iron depletion at delivery by 47% (RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.65). There was no effect of zinc or iron supplements on plasma zinc concentrations. Conclusions: Our findings support existing WHO guidelines on prenatal iron, vitamin A, and zinc supplementation among pregnant women. In this setting, scaling uptake of prenatal iron supplements is warranted, but prenatal zinc and vitamin A supplementation did not benefit maternal hematologic status at delivery. In settings where vitamin A deficiency is endemic, the efficacy and safety of the WHO recommended prenatal vitamin A supplementation require further evaluation.",Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,zinc supplements pregnancy,0.0,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,0.277901828289032
111,2021,19472602,"Observational studies in human populations suggest that maternal zinc deficiency during pregnancy may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes for the mother and fetus. Therefore, we reviewed the current evidence from studies of zinc supplementation, with or without other micronutrients, during pregnancy and lactation to assess its impact on maternal, fetal, and infant health. A meta-analysis of supplementation trials indicates a 14% reduction in premature delivery among zinc-supplemented women. Most studies found no significant impact of maternal zinc supplementation on infant birthweight, but a subset of studies conducted in underweight or zinc-deficient women suggests that there may be a positive effect of zinc supplementation in such women. However, the number of relevant studies is limited, and more information is needed to confirm these observations. The results for other pregnancy outcomes are inconsistent, and the number of available studies is small. Likewise, the impact of maternal zinc supplementation during pregnancy on infant postnatal growth and risk of infection is variable, and few studies are available. Thus, more research will be needed to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn, especially for the second half of infancy and later childhood. Studies found no adverse effects of maternal zinc supplementation on iron status during pregnancy. More information is required on other potential adverse effects, particularly with regard to a possible modifying effect of preexisting maternal zinc status. In view of the possible benefits of zinc supplementation for reducing the risk of premature delivery, the possible positive impact of zinc supplementation on infant birthweight among undernourished women, and the lack of reported adverse effects, zinc should be included in maternal supplements given during pregnancy in populations at risk for zinc deficiency.",Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,zinc supplements pregnancy,0.0,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,0.5900756120681763

112,2021,23633319,"Background: Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition, which usually develops in early childhood. Many children outgrow this disorder as they reach secondary school age, and although It may improve with age, there is no cure. Constant itch makes life uncomfortable for those with this condition, no matter what age they are, so it may have a significant effect on a person's quality of life. Its prevalence seems to be increasing as populations move from rural locations to cities. Some people, who do not see an adequate improvement or fear side-effects of conventional medical products, try complementary alternatives to conventional treatment. This is a review of evening primrose oil (EPO) and borage oil (BO) taken orally (by mouth); these have been thought to be beneficial because of their gamma-linolenic acid content. Objectives: To assess the effects of oral evening primrose oil or borage oil for treating the symptoms of atopic eczema. Search methods: We searched the following databases up to August 2012: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), AMED (from 1985), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registers and checked the bibliographies of included studies for further references to relevant trials. We corresponded with trial investigators and pharmaceutical companies to try to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We performed a separate search for adverse effects of evening primrose oil and borage oil in November 2011. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled, parallel, or cross-over trials investigating oral intake of evening primrose oil or borage oil for eczema. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently applied eligibility criteria, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We pooled dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR), and continuous outcomes using the mean difference (MD). Where possible, we pooled study results using random-effects meta-analysis and tested statistical heterogeneity using both the Chi(²) test and the I(²) statistic test. We presented results using forest plots with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results: A total of 27 studies (1596 participants) met the inclusion criteria: 19 studies assessed evening primrose oil, and 8 studies assessed borage oil. For EPO, a meta-analysis of results from 7 studies showed that EPO failed to significantly increase improvement in global eczema symptoms as reported by participants on a visual analogue scale of 0 to 100 (MD -2.22, 95% CI -10.48 to 6.04, 176 participants, 7 trials) and a visual analogue scale of 0 to 100 for medical doctors (MD -3.26, 95% CI -6.96 to 0.45, 289 participants, 8 trials) compared to the placebo group.Treatment with BO also failed to significantly improve global eczema symptoms compared to placebo treatment as reported by both participants and medical doctors, although we could not conduct a meta-analysis as studies reported results in different ways. With regard to the risk of bias, the majority of studies were of low risk of bias; we judged 67% of the included studies as having low risk of bias for random sequence generation; 44%, for allocation concealment; 59%, for blinding; and 37%, for other biases. Implications for practice: Oral borage oil and evening primrose oil lack effect on eczema; improvement was similar to respective placebos used in trials. Oral BO and EPO are not effective treatments for eczema.In these studies, along with the placebos, EPO and BO have the same, fairly common, mild, transient adverse effects, which are mainly gastrointestinal.The short-term studies included here do not examine possible adverse effects of long-term use of EPO or BO. A case report warned that if EPO is taken for a prolonged period of time (more than one year), there is a potential risk of inflammation, thrombosis, and immunosuppression; another study found that EPO may increase bleeding for people on Coumadin® (warfarin) medication. Implications for research: Noting that the confidence intervals between active and placebo treatment are narrow, to exclude the possibility of any clinically useful difference, we concluded that further studies on EPO or BO for eczema would be hard to justify.This review does not provide information about long-term use of these products.",Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,evening primrose oil eczema,0.0,Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,0.2178991734981537

112,2021,1318129,"Recently a defect in the function of the enzyme delta-6-desaturase has been discussed as a major factor in the development of atopic eczema. Delta-6-desaturase is responsible for the conversion of linoleic acid to gamma linolenic acid. Several plants, including evening primrose, are known to be fairly rich in gamma linolenic acid. Hence, substitution of gamma linolenic acid in patients prone to developing atopic eczema seems like a feasible concept. During the last few years different clinical trials have been performed. Controlled trials following a parallel study design showed marked improvement in atopic eczema. Patients treated with the drug showed less inflammation, dryness, scaling and overall severity compared to controls. Although these findings have been supported by meta-analysis, there is still conflicting evidence in trials based on a crossover design alone, demonstrating a decrease in itching. At present, evening primrose oil in doses used for the treatment of atopic eczema is considered safe.

112,2021,30065580,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is related to a deficiency of delta-6-desaturase, an enzyme responsible for converting linoleic acid to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). Evening primrose oil (EPO) as a source of GLA has been of interest in the management of AD. Objective: The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EPO in Korean patients with AD. Methods: Fifty mild AD patients with an Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) score of 10 or less were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups. The first group received an oval unmarked capsule containing 450 mg of EPO (40 mg of GLA) per capsule, while placebo capsules identical in appearance and containing 450 mg of soybean oil were given to the other group. Treatment continued for a period of four months. EASI scores, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and skin hydration were evaluated in all the AD patients at the baseline, and in months 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the study. Results: At the end of month 4, the patients of the EPO group showed a significant improvement in the EASI score ( p =0.040), whereas the patients of the placebo group did not. There was a significant difference in the EASI score between the EPO and placebo groups ( p =0.010).

113,2021,25896940,"Introduction: The majority of ankle fractures seen in clinic are stable, will not displace and do not require plaster casting to achieve union in a good position. Nevertheless, many patients with stable ankle fractures are advised that they need a cast. In this study we counseled patients regarding the different options for conservative management of their stable ankle fracture. We then encouraged them to make an informed decision on which method of treatment they would like to pursue. Materials and methods: We analyzed eight years of a single consultant's fracture clinic. 163 patients were offered a choice of: a weight bearing below knee cast; a functional ankle brace; or a regime of rest, ice, compression bandage and elevation (""RICE"" regime). All patients were advised to mobilize on the injured ankle as their pain allowed. Results: 163 patients were suitable for all 3 treatment options. 82% (133/163) chose an ankle brace, 15% (25/163) opted for a RICE regime and 3% (5/163) chose a below knee cast. Of these only one returned to clinic complaining of increased pain, however after further discussion the patient opted to continue with his RICE regime as planned. Discussion: A conservative approach to these injuries is now common practice; however there is a wide variation in what type of conservative management is given. Recent studies suggest orthopedic surgeons are still treating the majority of these injuries with a weight-bearing cast despite risks of stiffness, skin damage and thromboembolism. This study showed when the patient is given opportunity to make an informed choice the vast majority opt not to have a cast. The study suggests management of these injuries should be decided via a two-way conversation between patient and practitioner. Conclusions: Using a shared decision making approach to these injuries is a useful method of providing patients with the most suitable treatment for their personal treatment goals.",Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,ankle brace broken ankle,1.0,Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,0.11555270850658417
113,2021,28513248,"Ankle sprains represent a common musculoskeletal injury that clinicians are tasked with preventing and treating. Because of the prevalence of this injury, ankle braces have been designed to prophylactically protect the joint and reduce the incidence of repetitive sprains. Although an abundance of literature exists focusing on the efficacy of braces in preventing ankle sprains in young, healthy, and physically active populations, there is a scarcity of evidence specific to the impact of these apparatuses on functional performance; therefore, the purpose of this critically appraised topic (CAT) is to investigate the effects of ankle braces on functional performance measures in such individuals. The outcomes of this CAT will assist sport rehabilitation specialists with informed clinical decision making in managing young, healthy, and physically active populations using ankle braces. Do ankle braces hinder functional performance measures when compared with an unbraced condition in a young, healthy, and physically active population? A minimum of level II evidence research studies were surveyed for this CAT. For this CAT, 1 randomized controlled trial and 3 prospective cohort studies were selected. One study found a statistically significant main effect of increased agility run times while participants wore ankle braces. Another study demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in vertical jump height and ankle range of motion while wearing braces. No other statistically significant findings were reported among studies comparing unbraced with braced conditions. Current data indicate that young, healthy, and physically active individuals may experience varied performance effects when executing specific functional performance tasks while wearing ankle braces. In general, bracing does not appear to significantly impair performance on most functional tasks; however, decrements were noted to increases in agility run time and decreases in vertical jump height. Subsequent analysis indicated that a brace may result in decreased ankle plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, eversion, and inversion range of motion, which may underpin noted performance deficits.",Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,ankle brace broken ankle,1.0,Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,0.6403840780258179

Design: Multicentre randomised controlled trial. Setting: 20 trauma units in the UK National Health Service. Participants: 669 adults aged 18 years and older with an acute ankle fracture suitable for cast immobilisation: 334 were randomised to a plaster cast and 335 to a removable brace. Interventions: A below the knee cast was applied and ankle range of movement exercises started on cast removal. The removable brace was fitted, and ankle range of movement exercises were started immediately. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was the Olerud Molander ankle score at 16 weeks, analysed by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes were Manchester-Oxford foot questionnaire, disability rating index, quality of life, and complications at 6, 10, and 16 weeks. Results: The mean age of participants was 46 years (SD 17 years) and 381 (57%) were women. 502 (75%) participants completed the study.

We conducted a randomized cross-over study including adult participants with no previous lower limb or neurological pathology, who underwent gait analysis on an electronic walkway in three different ankle supports, Tubigrip(®), a stirrup brace and a walker boot. The 18 participants were an average age of 42 (SD 13, range 24-62) years and 14 (88%) were female. Compared to Tubigrip(®), gait in the walker boot was slower (-0.19 m/s, 95%CI -0.23 to -0.16, P 0.001), step length asymmetry was 10% (95%CI 9-12, P 0.001) worse, single support time asymmetry was 5% (95%CI 3-7, P 0.001) worse and participants also adopted a wider step width (4.1 cm, 95%CI 3.7-4.5, P 0.001). There were no important differences in gait between the Tubigrip(®) and stirrup brace.

However, new studies have recently been published that are not included in previous meta-analyses. Furthermore, the effects of bracing for primary prevention of ankle injuries are still unclear. Objective: The objective of this article was to systematically review the literature about the effectiveness of ankle bracing on primary and secondary prevention of acute ankle injuries in athletes. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and PEDro databases for eligible articles until July 2018. Randomized controlled trials that studied ankle bracing vs. no intervention for athletes were included. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Meta-analyses were conducted to study the effect of ankle bracing for primary and secondary prevention of ankle injuries. The Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method was used to determine the quality of evidence. Results: We included six randomized controlled trials. Significant risk ratios of 0.53 (95% confidence interval 0.32-0.88) and 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.24-0.58) were found in favor of ankle bracing vs. no ankle bracing for primary (low quality of evidence, I<sup>2</sup> = 77%) and secondary prevention (moderate quality of evidence, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) of acute ankle injuries. Numbers needed to treat were 26 and 12 for the primary and secondary prevention of acute ankle injuries.

113,2021,14620786,"Lateral ankle sprains are one of the most common injuries incurred in recreational and competitive athletics. These injuries have a significant impact in terms of cost, athletic participation, and activities of daily living. Prophylactic ankle braces are often used to reduce the risk of injury recurrence when individuals return to athletic participation. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to review the literature and provide our own experience relative to the use of prophylactic ankle bracing. Relatively high incidence rates of ankle sprain injury have been reported for basketball and soccer athletes, military trainees, and individuals with a previous history of ankle sprain injury. Semirigid and laced ankle braces have significantly reduced the incidence of initial and recurrent ankle sprain injuries in athletic and military samples. With few exceptions, these braces do not appear to affect functional performance adversely. The prophylactic use of semirigid ankle braces appears warranted to reduce the incidence of initial and, in particular, recurrent ankle sprain injuries for individuals who participate in activities that have the highest risk for these injuries.

113,2021,33596976,"Background: The application of ankle braces is an effective method for the prevention of recurrent ankle sprains. It has been proposed that the reduction of injury rates is based on the mechanical stiffness of the brace and on beneficial effects on proprioception and neuromuscular activation. Yet, how the neuromuscular system responds to the application of various types of ankle braces during highly dynamic injury-relevant movements is not well understood. Enhanced stability of the ankle joint seems especially important for people with chronic ankle instability. We therefore aimed to analyse the effects of a soft and a semi-rigid ankle brace on the execution of highly dynamic 180° turning movements in participants with and without chronic ankle instability. Methods: Fifteen participants with functional ankle instability, 15 participants with functional and mechanical ankle instability and 15 healthy controls performed 180° turning movements in reaction to light signals in a cross-sectional descriptive laboratory study. Ankle joint kinematics and kinetics as well as neuromuscular activation of muscles surrounding the ankle joint were determined. Two-way repeated measures analyses of variance and post-hoc t-tests were calculated. Results: Maximum ankle inversion angles and velocities were significantly reduced with the semi-rigid brace in comparison to the conditions without a brace and with the soft brace (p ≤ 0.006, d ≥ 0.303). Effect sizes of these reductions were larger in participants with chronic ankle instability than in healthy controls. Furthermore, peroneal activation levels decreased significantly with the semi-rigid brace in the 100 ms before and after ground contact. No statistically significant brace by group effects were found. Conclusions: Based on these findings, we argue that people with ankle instability in particular seem to benefit from a semi-rigid ankle brace, which allows them to keep ankle inversion angles in a range that is comparable to values of healthy people. Lower ankle inversion angles and velocities with a semi-rigid brace may explain reduced injury incidences with brace application. The lack of effect of the soft brace indicates that the primary mechanism behind the reduction of inversion angles and velocities is the mechanical resistance of the brace in the frontal plane.",Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,ankle brace broken ankle,1.0,Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,0.21955767273902893

Ankle and foot inversion angles, ankle inversion moments and peroneus longus EMG activity were recorded and analysed to determine the effectiveness of each condition to resist inversion. All braced conditions reduced ankle and foot inversion angles compared to UB. In the non-dominant limb, OF showed reduced maximum ankle inversion compared to BF (non-dominant mean difference = 0.630°, p 0.001) and reduced foot inversion compared to TAG (non-dominant mean difference = 0.966°, p = 0.035). Compared to UB, OF and TAG increased ankle inversion moments in the dominant ankle and showed decreases in the non-dominant ankle. BF reduced mean peak peroneus longus EMG activity compared to all other trials. Whilst statistically significant differences that were demonstrated between several braced conditions are relatively small, they are clinically significant knowing that the maximum barefoot inversion whilst standing is less than 17 degrees.",Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,ankle brace broken ankle,1.0,Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,0.3219433128833771
113,2021,22645884,"Ankle braces can protect the ankle joint from ligament sprains and fractures during high-risk military activities such as physical training and parachuting. Although braces are recommended for injury prevention purposes, the impact of braces on physical performance is unknown. This study evaluated lace-up ankle braces, worn inside the boots, across three conditions: no brace, unilateral brace, and bilateral brace on the dependent variables of dynamic lower extremity reach and obstacle course performance. Thirty-seven military cadets were tested over 3 days. Ankle bracing had a small effect upon anterior and composite lower extremity reach distances. Bracing had no effect upon obstacle course performance times. Inside-the-boot ankle bracing restricts lower extremity reaching and mildly impacts mobility, however, no restrictions were observed with running, climbing, jumping, or negotiating obstacles.

What is the evidence for this suggestion, and is this treatment suitable for all patients? Answer: Vitamin E is the main lipid-soluble antioxidant in the skin. Several anecdotal reports have suggested that topical use of vitamin E cream can reduce scar formation. Current evidence from the literature, however, does not support that proposition. In fact, studies report some adverse effects with use of vitamin E.

114,2021,10417589,"Background: Vitamin E is a generic term for a group of tocol and tocotrienol derivatives. Since the discovery that vitamin E is the major lipid soluble antioxidant in skin, this substance has been tried for the treatment of almost every type of skin lesion imaginable. Anecdotal reports claim that vitamin E speeds wound healing and improves the cosmetic outcome of burns and other wounds. Many lay people use vitamin E on a regular basis to improve the outcome of scars and several physicians recommend topical vitamin E after skin surgery or resurfacing. Objective: We attempted to determine whether topically applied vitamin E has any effect on the cosmetic appearance of scars as suggested by multiple anectodal reports. Methods: Fifteen patients who had undergone skin cancer removal surgery were enrolled in the study. All wounds were primarily closed in 2 layers. After the surgery, the patients were given two ointments each labeled A or B. A was Aquaphor, a regular emollient, and the B was Aquaphor mixed with vitamin E. The scars were randomly divided into parts A and B. Patients were asked to put the A ointment on part A and the B ointment on part B twice daily for 4 weeks. The study was double blinded. The physicians and the patients independently evaluated the scars for cosmetic appearance on Weeks 1, 4, and 12. The criteria was simply to recognize which side of the scar looked better if there was any difference. The patients' and the physicians' opinions were recorded. A third blinded investigator was shown photographs of the outcomes and their opinion was also noted. Results: The results of this study show that topically applied vitamin E does not help in improving the cosmetic appearance of scars and leads to a high incidence of contact dermatitis. Conclusions: This study shows that there is no benefit to the cosmetic outcome of scars by applying vitamin E after skin surgery and that the application of topical vitamin E may actually be detrimental to the cosmetic appearance of a scar. In 90% of the cases in this study, topical vitamin E either had no effect on, or actually worsened, the cosmetic appearance of scars. Of the patients studied, 33% developed a contact dermatitis to the vitamin E. Therefore we conclude that use of topical vitamin E on surgical wounds should be discouraged.",Can applying vitamin E cream remove skin scars?,vitamin e cream for skin scars,0.0,Can applying vitamin E cream remove skin scars?,0.663212776184082

Methods: A PubMed search was performed using products and methods claiming to improve scar appearance along with the terms ""scar"" and ""scarring"". Results: Published literature on scar massage, taping of scars, silicone gel and sheeting, onion-based extract products, and vitamin E was reviewed. Silicone gel/sheeting as well as taping have the most evidence to help improve scarring, but even then the evidence is conflicting and weak.

The prevention and minimization of such aberrant healing responses is more likely to yield better outcomes and require less time and expense. Objective and method: A review of the literature on various forms of prophylactic treatments intended to prevent or minimize the development of prominent postsurgical scars was performed using the Pubmed database over a period from 1987 to 2010. Search terms included ""scar prevention,"" ""scar minimization,"" ""post-surgical scar management,"" and ""surgical scars."" Results: Various over-the-counter topical products commonly used by patients have failed to demonstrate any significant benefits in improving final scar outcomes. Numerous interventions performed around the time of surgery, including botulinum toxin, lasers, and intradermal injectable products, have shown effectiveness in minimizing eventual scar appearance. Conclusions: Patient education on proper wound care is a simple method of improving the cosmetic appearance of surgical scars.

Natural drugs such as Aloe vera and vitamin E have been demonstrated to be beneficial in formulations for wound healing. The aim of this work is to develop and evaluate polymeric films containing Aloe vera and vitamin E to treat wounds caused by burns. Polymeric films containing different quantities of sodium alginate and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were characterized for their mechanical properties and drug release. The polymeric films, which were produced, were thin, flexible, resistant, and suitable for application on damaged skin, such as in burn wounds. Around 30% of vitamin E acetate was released from the polymeric films within 12 hours. The in vivo experiments with tape stripping indicated an effective accumulation in the stratum corneum when compared to a commercial cream containing the same quantity of vitamin E acetate. Vitamin E acetate was found in higher quantities in the deep layers of the stratum corneum when the film formulation was applied.

Magnesium (Mg) is a necessary ion for human body and has a crucial role in health and life maintenance. One of the main roles of Mg is to conserve neurons electric potential. Therefore, magnesium deficiency can cause neurological complications. Migraine is usually related to low amounts of Mg in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Magnesium concentration has an effect on serotonin receptors, nitric oxide synthesis and release, NMDA receptors, and a variety of other migraine related receptors and neurotransmitters. The available evidence suggests that up to 50% of patients during an acute migraine attack have lowered levels of ionized magnesium. Infusion of magnesium results in a rapid and sustained relief of an acute migraine in such patients. Two double-blind studies suggest that chronic oral magnesium supplementation may also reduce the frequency of migraine headaches.

In this double blind, randomized, placebo controlled study; we tried to evaluate the prophylactic effects of oral magnesium in migraine patients without aura. The prophylactic effects of 600 mg/day oral magnesium citrate supplementation were assessed by means of clinical evaluation, visual evoked potential and statistical parametric mapping of brain single photon emission computerized tomography before and after a 3 month treatment period. The results of 30 patients with migraine without aura (20-55 years old with 2-5 migraine attacks per month) on magnesium treatment were compared with those of 10 patients with similar properties on placebo treatment. Migraine attack frequency, severity and P1 amplitude in visual evoked potential examination decreased after magnesium treatment with respect to pretreatment values (p 0.001). In a comparison of the effects of magnesium treatment with those of placebo, post/pretreatment ratios of migraine attack frequency, severity and P1 amplitude in Mg treatment group were found to be significantly lower than those in placebo treatment group (attack frequency p = 0.005, attack severity p 0.001, P1 amplitude p 0.05). Cortical blood flow in inferolateral frontal (p 0.001), inferolateral temporal (p = 0.001) and insular regions (p 0.01) increased significantly after magnesium treatment with respect to the pretreatment; while such significant changes of cortical blood flow were not observed with placebo treatment.

Previous studies investigating the effect of intravenous and oral magnesium on acute migraine attacks and the prevention of migraine have produced equivocal findings. Objective: To evaluate the effects of intravenous magnesium on acute migraine attacks and oral magnesium supplements on migraine prophylaxis. Study design: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Electronic databases, namely EMBASE, PubMed, the Wanfang Data Chinese Database, and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database were searched from inception to February 24, 2015. Methods: This review was conducted according to the guidelines of the PRISMA. Only RCTs evaluating the effects of intravenous or oral magnesium on migraine compared with a control group were included. Results: A total of 21 studies were included. Of which, 11 studies investigated the effects of intravenous magnesium on acute migraine (948 participants) and 10 examined the effects of oral magnesium on migraine prophylaxis (789 participants). Intravenous magnesium significantly relieved acute migraine within 15 - 45 minutes, 120 minutes, and 24 hours after the initial infusion (Odd ratios [ORs] = 0.23, 0.20, and 0.25, respectively). Oral magnesium significantly alleviated the frequency and intensity of migraine (ORs = 0.20 and 0.27). Limitations: Some of the included studies did not adopt adequate randomization methods. Conclusions: Intravenous magnesium reduces acute migraine attacks within 15 - 45 minutes, 120 minutes, and 24 hours after the initial infusion and oral magnesium alleviates the frequency and intensity of migraine.

The contribution of magnesium deficiency to the induction of cortical depression or abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission is a likely mechanism of the magnesium-migraine relationship. Hence, there is interest in various methods of assessing magnesium ion deficiency and attempts to study the relationship of its intra- and extracellular levels with the induction of migraine attacks. At the same time, many clinicians believe that magnesium supplementation in the right dose and form can be a treatment to prevent migraine attacks, especially in those patients who have identified contraindications to standard medications or their different preferences. However, there are no reliable publications confirming the role of magnesium deficiency in the diet as a factor causing migraine attacks. It also seems interesting to deepen the research on the administration of high doses of magnesium intravenously during migraine attacks. The aim of the study was to discuss the probable mechanisms of correlation of magnesium deficiency with migraine, as well as to present the current clinical proposals for the use of various magnesium preparations in complementary or substitute pharmacotherapy of migraine.

An understanding of the physiology of exercise in health, and particularly the control of fuel mobilization and metabolism, gives an idea of problems that may arise in managing diabetes for sport and exercise. Recent findings: Exercise is complicated both by hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia in particular circumstances. Recent data demonstrate both early and late hypoglycaemia associated with endurance exercise and also give new insights into fuel use during exercise in diabetes. These data also provide potential explanations for the reduction in maximal exercise capacity sometimes observed in people with diabetes, although it should be noted that this observation is by no means universal.

They reported a lack of knowledge and understanding about diabetes among school staff and other young people. The overwhelming sense from young people was that although diabetes impacts upon their lives, with preparation, physical activity can take place as normal. Conclusions: Whilst young people had an awareness of the physical and psychological benefits of exercise in managing their diabetes, they experienced difficulties at school. Professional support and discussions with young people, giving tailored strategies for managing Type 1 Diabetes during exercise are needed. Healthcare teams should ensure that the support and educational needs of school staff are met.

116,2021,21339838,"Current recommendations are that people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus exercise regularly. However, in cases in which insulin or insulin secretagogues are used to manage diabetes, patients have an increased risk of developing hypoglycemia, which is amplified during and after exercise. Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia blunt autonomic nervous system, neuroendocrine and metabolic defenses (counter-regulatory responses) against subsequent episodes of falling blood glucose levels during exercise. Likewise, antecedent exercise blunts counter-regulatory responses to subsequent hypoglycemia. This can lead to a vicious cycle, by which each episode of either exercise or hypoglycemia further blunts counter-regulatory responses. Although contemporary insulin therapies cannot fully mimic physiologic changes in insulin secretion, people with diabetes have several management options to avoid hypoglycemia during and after exercise, including regularly monitoring blood glucose, reducing basal and/or bolus insulin, and consuming supplemental carbohydrates.",Does exercise help manage diabetes?,exercise diabetes,1.0,Does exercise help manage diabetes?,0.7880679368972778

Although most pregnant women do not meet minimal exercise recommendations, there are a growing number of physically active women who wish to continue training throughout pregnancy. Evidence acquisition: A search of the Web of Science database of articles and reviews available in English through 2014. The search terms exercise pregnancy, strenuous exercise pregnancy, and vigorous exercise pregnancy were used. Study design: Clinical review. Level of evidence: Level 3. Results: With proper attention to risk stratification and surveillance, exercise is safe for the mother and fetus. Benefits of exercise in pregnancy include reduction in Cesarean section rates, appropriate maternal and fetal weight gain, and managing gestational diabetes. Exercise as a means of preventing gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, or perinatal depression cannot be reliably supported. Overall, the current evidence suffers from a lack of rigorous study design and compliance with physical activity interventions. Conclusion: Research thus far has been unable to consistently demonstrate proposed benefits of exercise in pregnancy, such as preventing gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, or perinatal depression. However, moderate- and high-intensity exercise in normal pregnancies is safe for the developing fetus and clearly has several important benefits.

For individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), physical activity offers many health benefits including improved glycemic control, cardiovascular function, blood lipid profiles, and psychological well-being. Despite these benefits, many young people with T1D do not meet physical activity recommendations. Barriers to engaging in a physically active lifestyle include fear of hypoglycemia, as well as insufficient knowledge in managing diabetes around exercise in both individuals and health care professionals. Diabetes and exercise management is complex, and many factors can influence an individual's glycemic response to exercise including exercise related factors (such as type, intensity and duration of the activity) and person specific factors (amount of insulin on board, person's stress/anxiety and fitness levels). International guidelines provide recommendations for clinical practice, however a gap remains in how to apply these guidelines to a pediatric exercise consultation. Consequently, it can be challenging for health care practitioners to advise young people with T1D how to approach exercise management in a busy clinic setting.

Hypertension is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease world wide and new blood pressure reducing lifestyle interventions, such as fermented milk, would be of great importance. Objectives: To investigate whether fermented milk or similar products produced by lactobacilli fermentation of milk proteins has any blood pressure lowering effect in humans when compared to no treatment or placebo. Search methods: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), English language databases, including MEDLINE (1966-2011), EMBASE (1974-2011), Cochrane Complementary Medicine Trials Register, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) (1985-2011), Food science and technology abstracts (1969-2011). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials; cross over and parallel studies evaluating the effect on blood pressure of fermented milk in humans with an intervention period of 4 weeks or longer. Data collection and analysis: Data was extracted individually by two authors, afterwards agreement had to be obtained before imputation in the review. Main results: A modest overall effect of fermented milk on SBP was found (MD -2.45; 95% CI -4.30 to -0.60), no effect was evident on DBP (MD -0.67; 95% CI -1.48, 0.14). Authors' conclusions: The review does not support an effect of fermented milk on blood pressure. Despite the positive effect on SBP the authors conclude, for several reasons, that fermented milk has no effect on blood pressure. The effect found was very modest and only on SBP, the included studies were very heterogeneous and several with weak methodology. Finally, sensitivity and subgroup analyses could not reproduce the antihypertensive effect.

117,2021,30452697,"This review will explore the observational and mechanistic evidence supporting the hypothesis that fermented milk consumption has beneficial effects on metabolism. Live cultures in fermented dairy are thought to contribute to gut microbial balance, which is likely an instrumental mechanism that protects the host against gut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation associated with cardiometabolic diseases. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) release bioactive metabolites, such as exopolysaccharides and peptides, that have the potential to exert a wide range of metabolic and regulatory functions. In particular, peptides derived from fermented dairy products are likely to exert greater cardiometabolic and anti-inflammatory effects than nonfermented dairy. It is hypothesized that LAB-derived bioactive peptides have the potential to protect the host against cardiometabolic diseases through antimicrobial actions and to effect changes in gene expression of glucose regulatory and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. The peptides released through fermentation may explain some of the health effects of fermented dairy products on cardiometabolic disease risk observed in epidemiological studies, particularly type 2 diabetes; however, mechanisms have yet to be explored in detail.",Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,fermented milk blood pressure,0.0,Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,0.9989975094795227

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a fermented milk product containing Ile-Pro-Pro and Val-Pro-Pro and plant sterols on already established hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and aortic gene expression. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 195 mmHg were given either active milk (tripeptides and plant sterols), milk or water ad libitum for 6 weeks. SBP was measured weekly by the tail-cuff method. The endothelial function of mesenteric arteries was investigated at the end of the study. Aortas were collected for DNA microarray study (Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0 ST Array). The main finding was that active milk decreased SBP by 16 mmHg compared with water (178 (SEM 3) v. 195 (SEM 3) mmHg; P 0.001). Milk also had an antihypertensive effect. Active milk improved mesenteric artery endothelial dysfunction by NO-dependent and endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor-dependent mechanisms. Treatment with active milk caused mild changes in aortic gene expression; twenty-seven genes were up-regulated and eighty-two down-regulated. Using the criteria for fold change (fc) 0.833 or &gt; 1.2 and P 0.05, the most affected (down-regulated) signalling pathways were hedgehog, chemokine and leucocyte transendothelial migration pathways.

118,2021,29630150,"Aging individuals can develop generalized, exquisitely-pruritic, eczematous eruptions of uncertain etiology that can be therapeutically-refractory and life-altering. Limited information exists in the literature to guide clinicians in the diagnosis and management of such patients. It is suggested that in approximately 40% of such patients a known cause for their chronic pruritic eruptions cannot be identified. In this report we will refer to this subgroup of patients as having idiopathic chronic eczematous eruption of aging (CEEA). Idiopathic CEEA must be distinguished from other established eczematous dermatoses. Idiopathic CEEA patients often require long-term systemic immunosuppressive drugs to make living bearable. Elder-onset atopic dermatitis is the most difficult of the known dermatoses to distinguish from idiopathic CEEA. Because of their clinical similarities we questioned whether dupilumab (Dupixent®), the first FDA-approved biologic for atopic dermatitis, might be valuable in the management of idiopathic CEEA. We report the case of an elderly man with idiopathic CEEA of four-years' duration who had a complete clinical response to the initiation of treatment with dupilumab.

The information presented aims to provide dermatologists with updated therapeutic options, stimulate academic interest, and spark future research. Material and methods: Extensive search of ClinicalTrials.gov, the National Eczema Association, and PubMed was performed for clinical trials examining the effect of emerging targeted, systemic therapies in patients with AD. Results were included if they demonstrated efficacy in reversing AD symptoms. Studies that did not demonstrate clinical benefit were excluded. Results: A number of emerging systemic agents targeting specific mediators involved in the pathogenesis of AD were found.

118,2021,32489715,"Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD, eczema) is familial chronic inflammatory skin disease of complex etiology and increasing prevalence. Dupilumab is an IL-4 receptor subunit alpha (IL-4Rα) antagonist that is the first Food and Drug Administration-approved biological therapy for moderate-to-severe adult AD inadequately controlled with topical therapies. Adverse effects reported in the literature include injection site reactions, conjunctivitis, headache, and nasopharyngitis. Objective: We report the first cases of hyperhidrosis and bromhidrosis as side effects from dupilumab (Dupixent®) for the treatment of AD. Case reports: Case 1 is a 20-year-old woman with controlled allergic rhinitis and severe AD reported axillary hyperhidrosis with bromhidrosis, comparable to sweat from high-intensity exercise, with no relief from several different over-the-counter antiperspirants. Case 2 is a 61-year-old woman with history of chronic asthma, allergic contact dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and AD noticed markedly increased sweating with bromhidrosis that was reminiscent of her menopausal symptomology, about 3 months after initiating dupilimab. Discussion: Traditional immunosuppressive agents and corticosteroids have limited efficacy, numerous side effects, and increased risk of infection. The safety profile and efficacy of the newly approved IL-4Rα antagonist dupilumab may be favorable to oral immunosuppressants, but its use remains limited to severe recalcitrant cases, due to financial implications and lack of long-term safety data and comparative head-to-head trials. Conclusion: We report improved outcomes with dupilumab, in addition to unpublished cases of bromhidrosis and hyperhidrosis in 2 patients with AD. This report of additional complications may inspire further clinical research and assist clinicians in considering the option of dupilumab for uncontrolled AD, despite aggressive traditional treatment.",Can dupixent treat eczema?,dupixent eczema,1.0,Can dupixent treat eczema?,0.9988788962364197

This paper reports consensus decisions from the HOME VII meeting. Objectives: To complete the core outcome set for AE by agreeing on core outcome instruments for the domains of quality of life (QoL), long-term control and itch intensity. Methods: A face-to-face consensus meeting was held in Tokyo, Japan (8-10 April 2019) including 75 participants (49 healthcare professionals/methodologists, 14 patients, 12 industry representatives) from 16 countries. Consensus decisions were made by presentations of evidence, followed by whole and small group discussions and anonymous voting using predefined consensus rules. Results: It was agreed by consensus that QoL should be measured using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) for adults, the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) for children and the Infant's Dermatology Quality of Life Index (IDQoL) for infants. For long-term control, the Recap of Atopic Eczema (RECAP) instrument or the Atopic Dermatitis Control Test (ADCT) should be used. Consensus was not reached over the frequency of data collection for long-term control. The peak itch numerical rating scale (NRS)-11 past 24 h was recommended as an additional instrument for the symptom domain in trials of older children and adults. Agreement was reached that all core outcome instruments should be captured at baseline and at the time of primary outcome assessment as a minimum.

Objectives: To assess effectiveness and safety of treatment with dupilumab in the real-life clinical setting at a Danish tertiary referral centre. Methods: All patients with AD treated with dupilumab from October 2017 to October 2018 at Bispebjerg Hospital, Denmark, were included in the study. Patients were evaluated three times: at treatment initiation and at 1 and 3 months after first dupilumab injection. At each visit, disease activity was assessed by severity score (Eczema Area and Severity Index, EASI), patient-reported outcomes (Dermatology Life Quality Index, DLQI, pruritus and sleep score) and serological markers [immunoglobulin (Ig)E, eosinophil count and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)]. Results: A total of 43 patients were included in the study. The mean reduction in EASI score from baseline was 19.6 points (72.4%) at 1-month and 22.6 points (76.7%) at 3-month follow-up. EASI, DLQI, pruritus score, sleep score, IgE and LDH were all statistically significantly reduced between baseline and 1- and 3-month follow-up. Mean reductions in EASI score and LDH at 3-month follow-up were significantly correlated (P = 0.003). One patient (2.3%) discontinued treatment due to side-effects, and seven patients (18.4%) developed conjunctivitis during the study period.

Meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant overall effect in favor of yoga for physical function (HAQ-DI) (5 RCTs; SMD = -0.32, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.05, I <sup>2</sup> = 15%, P = 0.02), disease activity (DAS-28) (4 RCTs; SMD = -0.38, 95% CI -0.71 to -0.06, I <sup>2</sup> = 41%, P = 0.02) and grip strength (2 RCTs; SMD = 1.30, 95% CI 0.47-2.13, I <sup>2</sup> = 63%, P = 0.002). No effects were found for pain, tender joints, swollen joints count or inflammatory cytokines (i.e., CRP, ESR, IL-6, and TNF-α). Summary: The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that yoga may be beneficial for improving physical function, disease activity, and grip strength in patients with RA. However, the balance of evidence showed that yoga had no significant effect in improving pain, tender joints, swollen joints count, and inflammatory cytokines in patients suffering from RA. Considering methodological limitations, small sample size, and low-quality, we draw a very cautious conclusion in the results of the estimate of the effect. High-quality and large-scale RCTs are urgently needed in the future, and the real result may be substantially different.",Does yoga help reduce pain from arthritis and improve physical function?,yoga arthritis,1.0,Does yoga help reduce pain from arthritis and improve physical function?,0.8407236933708191

Recent findings: Mind-body interventions are becoming increasingly popular, including yoga and meditation. Randomized controlled trials have found these interventions to be helpful regarding pain, mood, and energy in RA patients. Other CAM modalities, such as natural products, special diets, acupuncture, and body-based therapies, also continue to be used by RA patients with limited evidence for efficacy and safety. While there are numerous CAM interventions available, the data is very limited at this time with only low-quality evidence supporting various therapies.

119,2021,28075155,"Objective: Yoga may improve physical function and reduce disease symptoms in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, little is known about how patients with RA are practicing yoga in the community. The objective of this qualitative study was to explore community yoga practice characteristics and thoughts about yoga practice for adults with RA. Design: Participants completed a semi-structured telephone interview with open-ended questions. Thematic analysis was used to analyze interview transcripts. Participants: A convenience sample of 17 adults with rheumatologist-diagnosed RA who had participated in yoga within the past year were asked about the decision to start, continue, and stop yoga; the perceived benefits of yoga; components of yoga sessions; and general thoughts about yoga as it relates to RA. Results: Although eight different styles of yoga were practiced, commonalities in yoga class components (such as stretching, strengthening, deep breathing, meditation, and positive messaging from the instructor) reveal examples of preferred types of yoga for patients with RA. Three main themes emerged, each with multiple subthemes: (1) motivators (physical fitness, influence of others, reduced price), (2) barriers (cost, symptom burden, class difficulty), and (3) benefits of yoga practice (mind-body, a tool for coping, pride/achievement, social, and ""yoga meets you where you are""). Conclusion: In this study, patients with RA described how yoga practice helped improve physical and psychosocial symptoms related to their disease. Yoga practice, a dynamic exercise, encompassing many different styles, can provide many benefits for adults with RA; however, yoga may not be beneficial for every adult with RA.",Does yoga help reduce pain from arthritis and improve physical function?,yoga arthritis,1.0,Does yoga help reduce pain from arthritis and improve physical function?,0.9023185968399048

Methods: There were 75 sedentary adults aged 18+ years with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or knee osteoarthritis randomly assigned to 8 weeks of yoga (two 60-min classes and 1 home practice/wk) or waitlist. Poses were modified for individual needs. The primary endpoint was physical health [Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS)] adjusted for baseline; exploratory adjusted outcomes included fitness, mood, stress, self-efficacy, SF-36 health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and RA disease activity. In everyone completing yoga, we explored longterm effects at 9 months. Results: Participants were mostly female (96%), white (55%), and college-educated (51%), with a mean (SD) age of 52 years (12 yrs). Average disease duration was 9 years and 49% had RA. At 8 weeks, yoga was associated with significantly higher PCS (6.5, 95% CI 2.0-10.7), walking capacity (125 m, 95% CI 15-235), positive affect (5.2, 95% CI 1.4-8.9), and lower Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (-3.0, 95% CI -4.8 - -1.3). Significant improvements (p 0.05) were evident in SF-36 role physical, pain, general health, vitality, and mental health scales. Balance, grip strength, and flexibility were similar between groups. Twenty-two out of 28 in the waitlist group completed yoga. Among all yoga participants, significant (p 0.05) improvements were observed in mean PCS, flexibility, 6-min walk, and all psychological and most HRQOL domains at 8 weeks with most still evident 9 months later. Of 7 adverse events, none were associated with yoga.

Studies have evaluated yoga to manage symptoms of RA and improve physical function; however, none has examined the relationship between yoga and work status in adults with RA. The objective was to describe differences in RA symptomatology, physical function scores, and work status between adults with RA who participate in yoga and those who do not. This cross-sectional study surveyed adults with rheumatologist-diagnosed RA regarding yoga use in the past year, symptoms, physical function, and work status. Differences between yoga and non-yoga participation groups were assessed with 2-sided t tests or Pearson χ tests. Multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to identify significant associations between yoga participation and primary outcomes. The sample included 398 adults with RA; 88% were females, 66% were white, mean age 61.8 years, mean disease duration 24.8 years; 10.6% participated in yoga. Vinyasa, Bikram, Hatha, Iyengar, and restorative yoga styles were practiced, mostly in a group setting. Yoga participants were significantly more likely to work full-time, less likely to be unable to work due to disability, and had better physical function. These findings characterize yoga practice and practitioners among adults with RA. In adults with RA, yoga participation is associated with full-time work status and better physical function than nonparticipation.

120,2021,34199479,"The acute treatment of migraine requires effective drugs that are well tolerated and provide rapid and consistent pain relief. Oral tablets are the most commonly used acute treatment for migraine; however, their effectiveness is limited by the rate of gastrointestinal (GI) tract absorption and first-pass hepatic metabolism, and they may not be ideal for patients experiencing GI motility issues. Nasal delivery is an attractive alternative route as it may circumvent GI tract absorption, avoid first-pass metabolism in the liver, and potentially reduce the frequency of GI adverse events. The large surface area and high vascularity within the nose may permit rapid absorption of therapeutics into the systemic circulation, allowing for rapid onset of action. However, the site of drug deposition (upper versus lower nasal cavity) may influence drug pharmacokinetics. Most approved nasal migraine therapies target the lower nasal space where the epithelium is less permeable, and they may be quickly cleared away due to increased ciliary function or dripping from the nose or swallowing, resulting in variable absorption and limited bioavailability. Together with its abundant vascularization, relative mucosal thickness stability, and low clearance rates, the upper nasal space harnesses the benefits of nasal delivery to potentially maximize drug efficacy.",Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,imitrex migraine,1.0,Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,0.9997851252555847
120,2021,27063965,"Migraine is a common and debilitating condition affecting approximately nearly one in four women in the USA and Europe. Episodic attacks can be associated with a number of symptoms, with nausea and/or vomiting being among the most frequent and distressing. Sumatriptan is widely used for acute treatment of migraine and is available in several formulations. The efficacy of oral sumatriptan is well-established. However, patients who experience migraine-associated nausea and/or vomiting can have difficulty swallowing tablets and may delay taking anti-migraine medication. In addition, absorption of oral sumatriptan can be reduced by migraine-associated gastroparesis. Non-oral formulations of sumatriptan are recommended for patients with nausea and/or vomiting, but their use may be limited by adverse effects and patient acceptance.

120,2021,27861837,"Background: Though migraine, particularly migraine with aura, is a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor, the scope and distribution of cardiovascular disease in representative samples of people with migraine are not known. This is important because many widely used acute migraine treatments, including triptans, ergot alkaloids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, carry precautions, warnings, or contraindications for use in persons with CV disease. Objectives: To assess the scope and distribution of cardiovascular events, conditions, and procedures in persons with episodic migraine in a representative sample of the US population, using data from the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) Study. Methods: Eligible subjects completed the 2009 AMPP survey, met ICHD-3beta criteria for migraine, and had a headache frequency of less than 15 days per month (episodic migraine). A survey on cardiovascular events (ie, myocardial infarction), conditions (ie, angina), and procedures (ie, carotid endarterectomy) was adopted from the Women's Health Study and the Physician's Health Studies. Cardiovascular events and conditions were defined by participant reports of having both experienced and received a physician diagnosis for a particular event or condition. The distribution of CV events, conditions, and procedures was summarized for the entire migraine sample and in groups defined by gender and age (22-39, 40-59, and ≥60). To assess the numbers of persons with episodic migraine in the US, we applied age and gender stratified estimates of migraine prevalence to the 2015 Census data. To estimate the number of cardiovascular events, conditions, and procedures in the US migraine population, we applied age and gender stratified event rates to the number of persons with episodic migraine in each stratum. Results: The 2009 AMPP Study survey was returned by 11,792 study participants out of 16,983 (64.9% response rate), including 6723 individuals who met study criteria for episodic migraine (5227 women and 1496 men). Among 22-39 year olds with episodic migraine, 3.4% reported having received a physician diagnosis of CV events or conditions and 1.1% reported undergoing CV related procedures. Among 40-59 year olds, 10.2% reported having received a physician diagnosis of CV events or conditions and 3.5% reported CV related procedures. For those age 60 or older, 22.3% reported CV events or conditions and 8.8% reported CV procedures. Prevalence of events, conditions, and procedures was higher in men than women and also in older age groups. However, the absolute number of CV events, procedures, and conditions was greater for women than men due to the higher population prevalence of episodic migraine in women. We projected that 2.0 million women and 665,000 men in the US had episodic migraine and a history of one or more CV event, condition, or procedure. By age group, it is estimated that 579,000 among those aged 22-39, 1.37 million of those aged 40-59, and 696,000 of those 60 and older with episodic migraine have ever had at least one CV event, procedure, or condition. Conclusion: Based on these analyses, we estimate that there are roughly 2.6 million people with episodic migraine aged 22 and older in the US with one or more prior CV event, condition, or procedure. For this group, cardiovascular contraindications to many migraine-specific acute migraine therapies may make treatment challenging.",Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,imitrex migraine,1.0,Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,0.9711368083953857
120,2021,22401601,"Background: The features of migraine attacks and the contexts in which migraine attacks occur vary from attack to attack and from patient to patient. Current treatment strategies, which are dominated by the use of oral forms of migraine medication, do not address this patient-to-patient and attack-to-attack heterogeneity. While current therapies, and, in particular, oral triptan tablets can be effective for many types of migraine attacks that a patient can experience, they may not be the optimum treatment for every migraine in every patient. Scope: This clinical review of subcutaneous sumatriptan discusses its characteristics, efficacy, and tolerability and considers its place in clinical practice. The review focuses particularly on several specific clinical settings in which subcutaneous sumatriptan might be a more appropriate therapeutic choice than the oral triptan tablet. Findings: Of the triptan formulations, subcutaneous sumatriptan is the most rapidly absorbed and demonstrates a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Data from randomized, double-blind, clinical trials and studies of patients' perceptions and preferences suggest that subcutaneous sumatriptan can be particularly useful to help restore normal work functioning, for migraine attacks that cannot be treated early in their course, for migraine attacks associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea or vomiting, and for difficult-to-treat migraines, including early-morning migraine and menstrual migraine. The majority of patients (9 in 10) trying subcutaneous sumatriptan indicated that they will use it again. Patients not fully satisfied with previous triptan therapy reported enhanced satisfaction with, and confidence in, treatment after trying subcutaneous sumatriptan. Conclusions: By virtue of their availability as multiple compounds and in multiple formulations including oral, intranasal, and injectable forms, triptans can be used to customize migraine therapy to the individual patient and the individual migraine attack. Due to its route of delivery and favorable pharmacokinetic profile, subcutaneous triptans may represent an attractive alternative for specific clinical settings. Subcutaneous sumatriptan can play a key role in maximizing likelihood of pain-free response and rapid return to normal daily activities and, as such, should be considered an important part of the treatment armamentarium for migraine.",Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,imitrex migraine,1.0,Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,0.9790284037590027

In the clinic, 158 adults with migraine diagnosed according to International Headache Society criteria received SC sumatriptan (6 mg) or placebo delivered with the IMITREX STATdose System for treatment of a migraine attack. By 120 minutes after SC dosing, 73% and 79% of sumatriptan-treated patients, compared with 28% and 37% of placebo-treated patients in studies 1 and 2, respectively, experienced headache relief (a statistically significant difference).

121,2021,18710579,"Background: Research suggests that depressive disorders exist on a continuum, with subthreshold symptoms causing considerable population burden and increasing individual risk of developing major depressive disorder. An alternative strategy to professional treatment of subthreshold depression is population promotion of effective self-help interventions that can be easily applied by an individual without professional guidance. The evidence for self-help interventions for depressive symptoms is reviewed in the present work, with the aim of identifying promising interventions that could inform future health promotion campaigns or stimulate further research. Methods: A literature search for randomised controlled trials investigating self-help interventions for depressive disorders or depressive symptoms was performed using PubMed, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Reference lists and citations of included studies were also checked. Studies were grouped into those involving participants with depressive disorders or a high level of depressive symptoms, or non-clinically depressed participants not selected for depression. A number of exclusion criteria were applied, including trials with small sample sizes and where the intervention was adjunctive to antidepressants or psychotherapy. Results: The majority of interventions searched had no relevant evidence to review. Of the 38 interventions reviewed, the ones with the best evidence of efficacy in depressive disorders were S-adenosylmethionine, St John's wort, bibliotherapy, computerised interventions, distraction, relaxation training, exercise, pleasant activities, sleep deprivation, and light therapy. A number of other interventions showed promise but had received less research attention. Research in non-clinical samples indicated immediate beneficial effects on depressed mood for distraction, exercise, humour, music, negative air ionisation, and singing; while potential for helpful longer-term effects was found for autogenic training, light therapy, omega 3 fatty acids, pets, and prayer. Many of the trials were poor quality and may not generalize to self-help without professional guidance. Conclusion: A number of self-help interventions have promising evidence for reducing subthreshold depressive symptoms. Other forms of evidence such as expert consensus may be more appropriate for interventions that are not feasible to evaluate in randomised controlled trials. There needs to be evaluation of whether promotion to the public of effective self-help strategies for subthreshold depressive symptoms could delay or prevent onset of depressive illness, reduce functional impairment, and prevent progression to other undesirable outcomes such as harmful use of substances.",Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,light therapy lamp depression,1.0,Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,0.5567823648452759
121,2021,31010505,"Psychological and pharmacological interventions are the most common treatments for adult depression. While these interventions have robust evidence supporting their efficacy, there remain up to 60 percent of individuals who do not respond to treatment, or only partially respond. Unfortunately, efforts at improving outcome rates from new or modified versions of psychological or pharmacological interventions have been disappointing. It is argued that increased treatment efficacy for depression may be achieved by utilising integrative or adjunctive treatments. As depression is influenced by an array of psychological, biological, social, environmental, dietary, and lifestyle factors, it is hypothesised that treatment outcomes will only be improved when integrative interventions are utilised. The research supporting the potential of several of these factors are reviewed in this article including those associated with diet, exercise, sleep, sunshine/light, nature, herbs and nutraceuticals, social connections, meditation, religion/spirituality, and alcohol and nicotine use.

Methods: Data were collected for the seasons September-April 2017-2018 and September-April 2018-2019. In total, 58 patients received light therapy for a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 21 days; there was a follow-up measurement after two weeks. Outcomes were quick inventory of depressive symptomatology (QIDS) scores and side effects. Results: QIDS scores were significantly lower at the last day of therapy (B = - 6.00, p 0.001) and 2 weeks after the end of treatment (B = - 6.55, p 0.001) compared with pre-intervention. Remission (QIDS ≤ 5) was reached in 55% of the treatments and response (50% symptom reduction) in 57% of the treatments. Side effects were mild; two hypomanic periods occurred. Conclusions: The Dutch light therapy protocol for patients with a bipolar disorder may be effective in treating a seasonal depression and side effects are mild. Light therapy deserves a prominent place in the treatment because effects may be large and quick.",Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,light therapy lamp depression,1.0,Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,0.9997161030769348

Method: This study was designed as a 5-week controlled, double-blind, parallel trial in out-patients with a diagnosis (DSM-IV) of non-seasonal major depression, randomized to either active treatment (white light, 10 000 lux, 1 h daily) or placebo treatment (red light, 50 lux, 30 min daily) and concomitant treatment with sertraline in both groups. Results: One hundred and two patients were included in the study. Analyses showed that on all used scales the reduction in depression scores was larger in the bright light group than in the dim light group, and this reached statistical significance on all observer rating scales and on the SCL-90R self-assessment scale. The HAM-D6 was the most sensitive scale to measure improvement at endpoint.

121,2021,27703764,"Background: Light therapy is a known treatment for patients with seasonal affective disorder. However, the efficacy of light therapy in treating patients with non-seasonal depression remains inconclusive. Aims: To provide the current state of evidence for efficacy of light therapy in non-seasonal depressive disorders. Method: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and CENTRAL from their inception to September 2015. Study selection, data abstraction and risk of bias assessment were independently conducted in duplicate. Meta-analyses were performed to provide a summary statistic for the included RCTs. The reporting of this systematic review follows the PRISMA guidelines. Results: A meta-analysis including 881 participants from 20 RCTs demonstrated a beneficial effect of light therapy in non-seasonal depression (standardised mean difference in depression score -0.41 (95% CI -0.64 to -0.18)). This estimate was associated with significant heterogeneity ( I <sup>2</sup>=60%, P =0.0003) that was not sufficiently explained by subgroup analyses. There was also high risk of bias in the included trials limiting the study interpretation. Conclusions: The overall quality of evidence is poor due to high risk of bias and inconsistency. However, considering that light therapy has minimal side-effects and our meta-analysis demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients achieved a clinically significant response, light therapy may be effective for patients with non-seasonal depression and can be a helpful additional therapeutic intervention for depression.

121,2021,27804203,"Wake therapy can reduce depressive symptoms within days, and response rates are high. To sustain the effect, it is often combined with light therapy. Few studies have focussed on factors related to patients' adherence to the regime, and none has used qualitative methods to examine their experience of these combined interventions. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to illuminate patients' experiences with wake and light therapy and factors related to adherence. Thirteen inpatients with depression were included. They participated in an intervention consisting of three wake therapies during the first week, 30 min of daily light treatment for the entire 9 weeks, and ongoing psychoeducation regarding good sleep hygiene. Patients kept a diary, and individual semistructured interviews were conducted. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The participants' overall experience with the treatment was positive. Some experienced a remarkable and rapid antidepressant effect, whereas others described more long-term benefits (e.g. improved sleep and diurnal rhythm). Yet recovery was fragile, and patients were only cautiously optimistic. Social support was important for maintaining the motivation to stay awake and receive daily light therapy. Overall, participants found the treatment worthwhile and would recommend it to others with depression. The study revealed a lack of knowledge among participants about the connection between regular sleep patterns and depression. In conclusion, this study provides insight into patients' experiences, and knowledge that can contribute to guidelines for future adherence-promoting organization of wake and light therapy.",Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,light therapy lamp depression,1.0,Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,0.9952476620674133
121,2021,27267951,"Background: The aim of the study was to examine the efficacy and safety of morning bright light therapy (BLT) in the treatment of patients with a current major depressive episode (MDE) in bipolar and unipolar disorder without a seasonal pattern. It was a randomized, sham-controlled trial. Methods: Adults, ages 18-70 years were randomized to treatment either with BLT or a sham negative ion generator (as a placebo control). The subjects were required to be on a stable and therapeutic dose of psychotropic medication for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and their treatment had to be insufficiently effective. Their clinical state was monitored at the baseline and at the end of treatment. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-21 items (HDRS-21), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression (PGI) were used. The results were analyzed with an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Results: Ninety-five patients were enrolled (50 diagnosed with bipolar disorder and 45 with unipolar depression). Fifty-two patients were randomized to treatment with BLT and forty-three were in the placebo group (ITT population). Eighty-three subjects completed the study. There were 12 dropouts (5 in the light group and 7 in the placebo group). After 14 days of treatment, a significant improvement was found in all groups (p 0.001). The subjects treated with BLT did not significantly differ in terms of improvement in HDRS-21 scores at the endpoint when compared to patients treated with placebo (p=0.2). However, further analysis demonstrated significantly higher response (50% v. 27.9%, p=0.02) and remission rates (28.8% v. 11.6%, p=0.04) among patients treated with morning BLT when compared to placebo group. It should be noted that in the population of drug-resistant patients, BLT was more efficacious than placebo. There were no statistically significant differences between unipolar and bipolar disorders (p=0.4). Conclusion: Although overall improvement in HDRS-21 scores were not superior in the BLT group, both response and remission rates were significantly higher among patients treated with BLT relative to those receiving the sham intervention. BLT was also more efficacious than placebo in the population of patients with drug-resistant depression.

121,2021,30477472,"Background: Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonally recurrent type of major depression that has detrimental effects on patients' lives during winter. Little is known about how it affects patients during summer and about patients' and physicians' perspectives on preventive SAD treatment. The aim of our study was to explore how SAD patients experience summers, what type of preventive treatment patients implement, which preventive treatment methods, if any, physicians recommend, and what factors facilitate or hinder implementation/recommendation of SAD prevention. Methods: We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews, ten with adult patients with a history of SAD and five with physicians. Transcripts were analyzed by two researchers using an inductive thematic analysis approach. Results: One group of patients was able to enjoy summer and ignore thoughts of the upcoming winter. The other group feared the impending depressive episode in winter, and this fear negatively impacted these patients' well-being during the summer. Preventive treatment was a relevant issue for all patients, and all but one person implemented SAD prevention during summer. We identified six factors that influenced patient use of preventive treatment of SAD. Four factors occur on an individual level (knowledge about disease and preventive treatment options, experience with treatment in acute phase, acceptability of intervention, willingness to take responsibility for oneself), one on an interpersonal level (social and work environment), and one on a structural level (healthcare system). All psychiatrists recommended some kind of preventive intervention, most commonly, lifestyle changes. Four factors influenced psychiatrists in recommending prevention of SAD (patient expectations, disease history and stability, risk/benefit ratio, lack of evidence). Conclusions: Success in the implementation of SAD prevention does not solely depend on the willingness of the patients, but is also influenced by external factors. Raising awareness of SAD among general practitioners and low-level access to mental-health support could help patients find appropriate help sooner. To better guide the optimal treatment choice, comparative effectiveness research on treatments to prevent a new onset in patients with a history of SAD and clinical practice guidelines on SAD are needed.",Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,light therapy lamp depression,1.0,Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,0.7046791911125183

Objective: This meta-analysis sought to evaluate the effectiveness of light therapy among older patients with non-seasonal depression. Methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI and CBM from the inception of each database to May 2017. Two researchers conducted the literature screening, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment independently. We used the Cochrane Collaboration's bias assessment tool to evaluate the risk of bias for included studies, and Review Manager 5.2.3 Software for the meta-analysis. Results: Six trials with a total of 359 patients were included, and five studies were assessed as being of low risk for bias. We evaluated the effect of light therapy on depression by the reduction of depressive symptoms (SMD = 0.45; 95% CI= [0.14, 0.75]). The subgroup analysis did not find significant moderating effects of depression with intervention intensity, light type, measuring scale or intervention duration. Limitations: Most of the study samples were not representative of the larger population of adults and therefore caution should be used when interpreting the findings.

It is possible that these disorders share a dopaminergic dysfunction in the hypothalamic A11 nucleus that contributes to this association. However, there have been no clinical studies to evaluate the effect of dopaminergic treatment on migraine symptoms in patients with concomitant migraines and RLS. Methods: We present an illustrative patient with concomitant RLS and migraine who showed improvement in her headache frequency and RLS symptoms following immediate-release pramipexole (P-IR) treatment and provide review results from the medical records of patients who experienced both migraines and RLS in our previous cross-sectional study. Results: Ten patients (nine patients from the previously completed single-center study) received P-IR treatment were included in the study. RLS symptoms improved markedly in all of the subjects. Five out of the 10 patients (50%) reported improvement in migraine headaches. Of these five patients, four (80%) had reported morning headaches before P-IR treatment. Discussion: Our results indicate that the identification of RLS in migraine patients is clinically significant and that dopaminergic treatment may improve both migraines, particularly morning headache (80% improvement in this study), and RLS symptoms.

Safety, efficacy, common misconceptions, and research are discussed, allowing practitioners, chiropractic students, and the general public to make informed decisions regarding utilization and referrals for this distinctive type of chiropractic care. Upper cervical techniques share the same theoretical paradigm in that the primary subluxation exists in the upper cervical spine. These procedures use similar assessments to determine if spinal intervention is necessary and successful once delivered. The major difference involves their use of either an articular or orthogonal radiograph analysis model when determining the presence of a misalignment. Adverse events following an upper cervical adjustment consist of mild symptomatic reactions of short-duration ( 24-hours).

122,2021,19347025,"One of the most exciting developments in modern neuroscience has been the application of imaging techniques to provide new insights into the organization of the human brain in vivo. Functional imaging methods, such as PET and functional MRI, have become the preferred techniques for detection of the structure-function relationships within the brain that are characteristic of headache. This Review focuses on neuroimaging as a diagnostic tool for headache and highlights the advances made with functional and structural neuroimaging techniques in the study of primary headache syndromes such as migraine and trigeminal autonomic headaches. Several independent functional studies have reinforced the crucial role of the brainstem in acute and chronic migraine and of the hypothalamic area in trigeminal autonomic headaches. Structural abnormalities that have been identified in the visual network of motion-processing areas could account for, or result from, the cortical hyperexcitability observed in patients with migraine. Several morphometric studies suggest that gray matter volume and/or concentration is decreased in pain-transmitting areas in patients with migraine or tension-type headache. Given the rapid advances in functional neuroimaging, this technique will continue to be of paramount importance in patients with headache and might ultimately serve as the bridge between molecular and clinical domains in headache research.",Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,aleve migraine,0.0,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,0.9917196035385132

122,2021,16504916,"In addition to its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved conditions, immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) is now being used to treat a vast array of autoimmune disorders. Some of the reasons for this overall increase in the use of IGIV include its effectiveness and safety. Despite many years of safe use, side effects and adverse reactions still occur. Common and mild side effects associated with IGIV include: headache, malaise, nausea, low-grade fever, urticaria, arthralgias, and myalgia. These symptoms typically resolve within a few days after their onset. Although rare, the serious and potentially fatal side effects include: anaphylactic reactions, aseptic meningitis, acute renal failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and other thrombotic complications. Many of these side effects have occurred in patients who have significant, underlying risk factors for the development of the event. Thus, it is vitally important that a thorough and comprehensive medical evaluation be performed on every patient who is being evaluated for potential IGIV therapy. This evaluation can, to some extent, significantly minimize the risk of these side effects. Careful, constant, and close monitoring by trained personnel during the infusion can also result in early detection of such events.

122,2021,26823204,"Objective: The study aimed to determine the effects of presenting uncertainty of quantitative risk information about medication harms and benefits on intention to take medication and psychosocial outcomes. Methods: 147 participants were randomized into four hypothetical scenarios: (1) harm/benefit presented as point-estimates, (2) harm as point/benefit as range, (3) harm as range/benefit as point, (4) harm/benefit as ranges. We assessed participants' intention to take medication, understanding, decisional conflict, and perceived benefit and harm. Participants viewed the scenario again with swapped range vs. point-estimate presentations; intention was re-assessed at time 2. Results: There were no significant differences in intention across arms (p=0.93). There was an increase in intention to take medication between time 1 and time 2 in arm 4 (both harm/benefit presented as ranges, then point estimates). Understanding was greater when information was presented as point estimates compared to ranges, for both benefit (all questions correct: 74% vs 42%; χ2=15.28, df=2, p 0.001) and harm (all questions correct: 70% vs 43%; χ2=11.19, df=2, p=0.004) CONCLUSION: Changes in benefit information appear to be more influential in changing intention to take medication than harm information.

122,2021,1557187,"Pharmacotherapy is the mainstay for patients with persistent headaches. When simple analgesics can no longer be used, combination analgesics are prescribed. Symptomatic medications also include antiemetics, ergot derivatives, corticosteroids, neuroleptics, and narcotics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used both symptomatically and prophylactically, and are the treatment of choice for menstrual migraine. Exertional migraine, benign orgasmic cephalalgia, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, cough headache, and ""ice-pick"" headache are treated with indomethacin. Ergotamine tartrate is often recommended when simple or combination analgesics do not relieve headaches. Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is effective for treating intractable headache; because it has fewer side effects than ergotamine, it is tolerated by patients unable to tolerate other ergotamine preparations. DHE is administered IM and, for occasional use, patients can be taught self-injection. Repetitive IV DHE therapy for chronic severe headaches requires hospitalization; most patients become headache-free within 3 days. Patients who refuse hospitalization, do not respond to the drug, or are not suitable candidates for DHE therapy may receive a short course of a corticosteroid, a neuroleptic or, rarely, a narcotic.

122,2021,18594393,"Background: Surgical decompression of various trigger sites has been shown by two authors to relieve migraine headaches. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical decompression of multiple migraine trigger sites in a clinical practice setting, and to compare the results to those previously published. Methods: A retrospective, descriptive analysis was performed on 18 consecutive patients who had undergone various combinations of surgical decompression of the supraorbital, supratrochlear, and greater occipital nerves and zygomaticotemporal neurectomy performed by a single surgeon. All patients had been diagnosed with migraine headaches according to neurologic evaluation and had undergone identification of trigger sites by botulinum toxin type A injections. Results: The number of migraines per month and the pain intensity of migraine headaches decreased significantly. Three patients (17 percent) had complete relief of their migraines, and 50 percent of patients (nine of 18) had at least a 75 percent reduction in the frequency, duration, or intensity of migraines. Thirty-nine percent of patients have discontinued all migraine medications. Mean follow-up was 16 months (range, 6 to 41 months) after surgery. One hundred percent of participants stated they would repeat the surgical procedure. Conclusions: This study confirms prior published results and supports the theory that peripheral nerve compression triggers a migraine cascade. The authors have verified a reduction in duration, intensity, and frequency of migraine headaches by surgical decompression of the supraorbital, supratrochlear, zygomaticotemporal, and greater occipital nerves.

Methods: In this double-blind, randomized crossover study, 10 subjects first brushed for one week with a washout toothpaste. On the evening of Day 7, prior to tooth brushing, Plaque Index (PI) was recorded, then plaque stained and photographed. Subsequently subjects were randomized to either brush with the test dental gel or the control. After overnight plaque accumulation, PI was recorded. Plaque was stained and photographed before and after subjects brushed with the same toothpaste as the previous night. Subsequently, the process was repeated with the second toothpaste. Image J software was used to quantify plaque presence. Results: Mean increase in PI overnight after brushing (1.78 versus 0.94) and final PI after tooth brushing the next morning (2.20 versus 1.31) were significantly (p 0.05) better after use of the test gel. Tooth surface covered by plaque overnight was significantly higher after using the control gel (22.3%) than the test gel (11.8%; p 0.05). After morning brushing, the residual area of plaque on the teeth was significantly higher for the control gel (9.2%) than for the test gel (3.6%; (p 0.05).

123,2021,30683113,"Background: Dental caries is a recognized worldwide public health problem. Despite being one of the most effective strategies against dental caries, the excessive use of fluorine may result in a potential risk of developing dental fluorosis especially in children under age of six. The purpose of this work is to analyze a fluorine-free toothpaste containing Biomimetic Hydroxyapatite to assess enamel re-mineralizing and repairing properties. Results: The study was performed in vitro and in vivo, comparing the hydroxyapatite toothpaste with two others toothpaste containing different fluorine concentrations. The coating effect of the micro-structured Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles reintegrates the enamel with a biomimetic film reproducing the structure and the morphology of the biologic Hydroxyapatite of the enamel. As demonstrated, the coating is due to the deposit of a new layer of apatite, which presents fewer particles than the natural enamel, not based on the chemical-physical changes occurring in fluorinated toothpastes. Moreover, it shows resistance to brushing as a consequence of chemical bonds between the synthetic and natural crystals of the enamel. Conclusions: The use of Biomimetic Hydroxyapatite toothpastes has proven to be a valuable prevention measure against dental caries in primary dentition since it prevents the risk of fluorosis.",Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,toothpaste pimple overnight,0.0,Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,0.16653287410736084

Methods: An in situ, single centre, single blind, randomised, split mouth study, evaluated the difference in abrasion of 2 toothpastes (SFM - Sensodyne Fresh Mint(®) RDA 70; CPHM - Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint(®) RDA 120) in 28 healthy volunteers. Two toothpaste treatments were administered 3×/day, for each of the two 15 day periods, subjects wearing bi-lateral, lower buccal appliances each with 4 dentine sections. A 2 min extra-oral acidic challenge preceded toothbrushing for 2 study arms. Contact profilometry measured samples at baseline, days 5, 10 and 15. Results: Brushing with SFM was significantly less abrasive than brushing with CPHM at all time points, with or without a preceding acidic challenge (p 0.0001). The additional dentine loss arising from the erosive challenge prior to brushing with each paste was linear with time and independent of abrasive effect. Conclusions: The desensiting toothpastes' RDA, directly related to dentine loss with toothbrushing. An acidic challenge prior to brushing did not negate the benefits of reduced wear from the lower RDA paste compared to the higher RDA paste. When brushing eroded dentine, the additional wear appeared independent of abrasive effect. Dentine hypersensitivity sufferers should be recommended to use a low-moderate RDA toothpaste, not to brush more than 2×/day and not immediately following an acidic challenge.",Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,toothpaste pimple overnight,0.0,Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,0.7579891681671143

This hypothesis was tested with formulations with either all fluoride in a soluble form (NaF/SiO2-based toothpaste, 1,100 µg F/g as labeled, 1,129.7 ± 49.4 µg F/g soluble fluoride as analyzed) or with around 20% of insoluble fluoride (Na2FPO3/CaCO3-based toothpaste, 1,450 µg F/g as labeled, 1,122.4 ± 76.4 µg F/g soluble fluoride as analyzed). Toothpastes were evaluated either fresh or after accelerated aging, which increased insoluble fluoride to 40% in the Na2FPO3/CaCO3-based toothpaste. In a blind, crossover clinical trial conducted in five legs, 20 adult volunteers ingested 49.5 µg of total fluoride/kg body weight from each formulation or purified water (control). Whole saliva and urine were collected as bioavailability indicators, and pharmacokinetics parameters calculated showed significantly (p 0.05) lower fluoride bioavailability for Na2FPO3/CaCO3 toothpaste, which was reduced further after aging. A significant correlation between the amount of soluble fluoride ingested, but not total fluoride, and fluoride bioavailability was found (r = 0.57, p 0.0001). The findings suggest that the estimated fluorosis risk as a result of ingestion of Na2FPO3/CaCO3-based toothpastes should be calculated based on the toothpaste's soluble rather than total fluoride concentration.",Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,toothpaste pimple overnight,0.0,Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,0.015093979425728321

Individual preventive measures are not adequate enough to control the disease especially in children with high caries experience The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of tooth paste containing enzymes and proteins in inhibiting plaque re-growth when compared to fluoride tooth paste in children with high caries experience. Material and methods: A total of 15 plaque samples are collected from 15 subjects in the age group of 5-7 years with High caries experience. The participants were asked to fast overnight for 12 h. On the day of the study, the participants were asked to report without brushing. Pre brushing pooled plaque was collected from buccal and palatal/lingual surfaces of maxillary and mandibular teeth and transferred to chilled Eppendorf tubes. Samples were divided into two groups; according to the test toothpaste used; Zendium toothpaste and Colgate cavity protection along with controls. Inhibition of plaque re-growth is assessed by comparing optical density using a spectrophotometer at intervals between 0-8 hours. Results: Results demonstrated that toothpaste containing enzymes and proteins can significantly inhibit plaque growth when compared to normal toothpaste ( p 0.05) in children with high caries experience.

Materials and methods: At baseline, 36 subjects were evaluated for malodor (9-point organoleptic scale [OLT]), dental plaque (Turesky modification of Quigley-Hein; PI), gingivitis (Lφe-Silness; GI) and bleeding (Ainamo and Bay; BI) and randomized to (1) tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste, or (2) a regimen comprising tooth brushing with a triclosan toothpaste and mouth rinsing with CPC mouthrinse. After the first use of assigned treatments, subjects were evaluated for malodor 2 h after breakfast (OLT-2 h) and used provided treatments for the next 14 days. On the 7 th and 14 th days, subjects refrained from oral hygiene for 12 h before evaluations (OLT, PI, GI, and BI) and then performed oral hygiene at the dental clinic. Subjects were evaluated for malodor 2 h after breakfast (OLT-2 h) and self-assessed their malodor on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). Results: Treatment groups demonstrated no significant differences in OLT, PI, GI, BI at baseline (P &gt; 0.05). OLT-2 h scores after the first use of regimen and after tooth brushing alone were 5.94 and 6.21, respectively, and were statistically significantly different (P 0.05). Correspondingly, the regimen demonstrated progressive reductions in OLT and OLT-2 h on the 7 th and 14 th day evaluations (5.81, 4.88, and 5.09, 4.20, respectively) and were significantly lower than after tooth brushing alone (6.49, 6.18, and 6.35, 5.99, respectively) (P 0.05).

123,2021,35075780,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect influence of fluoridated toothpastes and fluoride-free toothpaste with hydroxyapatite (HAP) as active ingredient on initial bacterial colonization on enamel in situ. Methods: For this clinical-experimental pilot study, eight subjects were instructed to brush their teeth with three different toothpastes (Elmex<sup>®</sup> : 1400 ppm AmF, Meridol<sup>®</sup> : 1400 ppm AmF +SnF2, Karex<sup>®</sup> : HAP), using each for two consecutive days. As a control, brushing without toothpaste was performed. To evaluate bacterial colonization, subject wore splints with buccally placed bovine enamel platelets overnight. Two modes were tested. In a first pass (regimen A), the splints were inserted after toothbrushing to examine the indirect effects of the dentifrices. In order to investigate the direct effects, the specimens were brushed in situ in a second pass (regimen B). Biofilm formation was visualized and quantified using fluorescence microscopy (DAPI and BacLight) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: For brushing regimen A (indirect effect of dentifrices), no statistical differences were detected between any of the tested dentifrices or the control. Likewise, no statistically significant differences were recorded for brushing regimen B (direct effect of dentifrices). Furthermore, no differences between the different brushing techniques were determined with regard to the ultrastructure of the overnight biofilm. Conclusion: Within the limitations of the present pilot study, it can be concluded that in patients with good oral hygiene, dentifrices and their chemical composition have no statistically significant effect on the initial bacterial colonization of enamel platelets in situ, irrespectively of the mode of application.",Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,toothpaste pimple overnight,0.0,Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,0.22204972803592682

Materials and methods: Four enamel slabs were cut from each of 14 impacted third molars and randomly assigned into 4 groups. Unstimulated saliva samples were collected from two age and sex matched volunteers. One of the samples was taken from a heavy smoker and the other sample was taken from a non-smoker. Two groups (A and B) were shaken in saliva (A in smoker's saliva, B in nonsmoker's saliva) for 5 min and then shaken for 3 min in a toothpaste/deionized water slurry (1:3 w/w). One of the groups (group C) received no saliva treatment and was only shaken in toothpaste slurry for 3 min. The treatment was repeated after a 6-hour period. One of the groups (D) served as a control group with no treatment. Results: Calcium concentration in the smoker's saliva was higher than in the nonsmoker's saliva. The enamel uptake of KOH-soluble fluoride in group A was significantly higher than that in the other two treatment groups, B and C. The enamel uptake of KOH-soluble fluoride in all 3 groups was statistically different from that in the control group. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that saliva collected from a heavy smoker, which had higher salivary calcium concentration, enhances enamel uptake of alkali-soluble fluoride and encourages us to conduct a large-scale study.",Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,toothpaste pimple overnight,0.0,Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,0.7587173581123352

Patients with painful, Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2-3, osteoarthritis of the knee were treated with oral chondroitin sulfate at a dose of either 260 mg/d (low-dose group, control group) or 1560 mg/d (high-dose group). Symptoms were evaluated by the Lequesne's index and visual analog scale for pain. We made subgroup analyses according to background symptom severity (Lequesne's index ≥8 or 8) in 73 patients. Serum level of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and hyaluronic acid were also determined. In the subgroup with severe symptoms (Lequesne's index ≥8), the chondroitin sulfate dose of 1560 mg/d improved pain faster after 6 and 9 months' therapy. However, no dose-related effects were found on cartilage oligomeric matrix protein or hyaluronic acid levels. Chondroitin sulfate also had good tolerability.

In spite of its high prevalence, pain in this patient group is not always sufficiently considered or treated in an effective manner. Aim: The recommendations presented in this paper address possible improvements in pain management in hemophilia patients and particularities that have to be taken into account in this patient group. Method: The manifold aspects of pain management in hemophilia patients were discussed within the framework of an expert meeting. Based on the available literature and the experts' clinical experience, the participants developed a set of recommendations presented in this paper. Results: Pain management in patients with hemophilia is often insufficient, a fact that not only influences the patients' quality of life but also implies the risk of difficult to manage chronic pain. Both the prevalent polypharmacy (due to comorbidities) as well as the underlying disease itself present special challenges to pain therapy in this patient group. The present review and recommendations are intended to support medical professionals in recognising the risks of pain chronicity, applying basic principles of multimodal pain therapy, including the options of psychological intervention and modalities of physical medicine in therapy concepts, and reaching a comprehensive understanding of the range of analgesic options available.",Can chondroitin help relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,"

Chondroitin-S reduces the concentration of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factor involved in inflammation. GlcN.S enhances cartilage specific matrix components and prevents collagen degeneration in chondrocytes by inhibiting hydrolytic enzymes, and preventing the oxidation of lipids and proteins. Chondroitin-S plus GlcN.S are slow-acting drugs that alleviate pain and partly restore joint function in OA patients. Orally administered pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin-S plus GlcN.S stabilize the joint space narrowing and significantly decrease the number of patients with new erosive OA. They are safe and no adverse events have ever been reported; they are recommended by EULAR and OARSI. The cost/effectiveness of the oral chondroitin-S plus GlcN.S therapy derives from the reduction of costs for physiotherapy, and for gastroprotective and non-steroidal drugs.

However, available pharmaceutical treatments have limitations in terms of efficacy and long-term safety. Recent findings: In vitro evidence suggests that some natural products may possess anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties and may inhibit the release of key osteoarthritis-related cytokines. There is, therefore, ongoing interest in identifying natural products that safely promote joint health and treat osteoarthritis. Numerous plant extracts, including curcumin, Boswellia extract, and pycnogenol, have shown effect sizes (ES) for reducing pain and functional disability larger than those observed with analgesics and products such as glucosamine and chondroitin. The ES for methylsulfonylmethane and avocado/soybean unsaponifiables are also considered to be clinically relevant.

The control of triglyceride (TG) levels is essential to prevent the development of coronary artery disease and pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia. Omega-3-carboxylic acid (Epanova) is the third prescription omega-3 fatty acid product approved in the United States as an adjunct to diet for treating severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL). At the approved dosage, it reduced baseline serum TG levels by 25-30% in a placebo-controlled study. It reduced serum TG levels by an additional 8-15% in patients who were already taking statin therapy. It appeared to have a better bioavailability profile compared with an equivalent dose of omega-3-acid ethyl ester (Lovaza) in both low-fat and high-fat diets. However, evidence behind the effects of omega-3-carboxylic acid on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and pancreatitis risk, is lacking. Overall, it is well tolerated, but may induce common gastrointestinal side effects, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.

Objective: The aim of the EFFECT I trial (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02354976"" title=""See in ClinicalTrials.gov"">NCT02354976</a>) was to determine the effects of free omega-3 carboxylic acids (OM-3CA) and fenofibrate on liver fat in overweight or obese individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hypertriglyceridemia. Methods: Seventy-eight patients were randomized to receive oral doses of 4 g OM-3CA (n = 25), 200 mg fenofibrate (n = 27), or placebo (n = 26) for 12 weeks in a double-blind, parallel-group study. Liver proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and volume, pancreas volume, and adipose tissue volumes were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Changes in liver PDFF at 12 weeks were not significantly different across treatment groups (relative changes from baseline: placebo, +4%; OM-3CA, -2%; and fenofibrate, +17%). The common PNPLA3 genetic polymorphism (I148M) did not significantly influence the effects of OM-3CA or fenofibrate on liver PDFF. Fenofibrate treatment significantly increased liver and pancreas volumes vs placebo treatment, and the changes in liver and pancreas volumes were positively correlated (rho 0.45, P = .02). Total liver fat volume increased significantly in patients using fenofibrate vs OM-3CA (+23% vs -3%, P = .04). Compared with OM-3CA, fenofibrate increased total liver fat and liver volume. Serum triglycerides decreased with OM-3CA (-26%, P = .02) and fenofibrate (-38%, P .001) vs placebo. In contrast to OM-3CA, fenofibrate reduced plasma docosahexaenoic acid levels and increased plasma acetylcarnitine and butyrylcarnitine levels, estimated delta-9 desaturase activity and the concentration of urine F2-isoprostanes. Conclusions: OM-3CA and fenofibrate reduced serum triglycerides but did not reduce liver fat.

125,2021,18422480,"Background: Moderate hypertriglyceridemia is fairly common, and elevated triglycerides are a risk factor for coronary heart disease. The omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA have been shown to lower triglycerides in many clinical studies. Prescription omega-3 fatty acid concentrates (P-OM3) are indicated for use in people with very high triglycerides (&gt; 500 mg/dl). Current guidelines recommend that triglycerides should be less 150 mg/dl. Objective: This review provides an overview of the use of omega-3 concentrates (both P-OM3 and over-the-counter fish oil) to lower triglycerides in people who have moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides in the range of 150 - 500 mg/dl). The objectives were to examine clinical evidence, describe the magnitude of effects and predict future clinical use of P-OM3. Methods: Published, peer-reviewed studies of omega-3 concentrates were included if they were placebo-controlled, double-blind, of sufficient size to demonstrate triglyceride lowering, and studied a population described as having a mean baseline triglyceride value of 150 - 500 mg/dl. Studies using the 4-g dose of P-OM3 were used to develop a model of percent triglyceride lowering as a function of baseline levels. Results/conclusions: P-OM3 are effective in reducing triglycerides by approximately 30% in this population and are likely to be combined with other drugs (e.g., statins) to treat combined dyslipidemia.",Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,omega-3 fatty acids hypertriglyceridemia,1.0,Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,0.9565787315368652
125,2021,25914523,"High levels of plasma triglycerides (TG) are a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, often associated with anomalies in other lipids or lipoproteins. Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), particularly at very high levels, significantly increases also the risk of acute pancreatitis. Thus, interventions to lower TG levels are required to reduce the risk of pancreatitis and cardiovascular disease. Several strategies may be adopted for TG reduction, including lifestyle changes and pharmacological interventions. Among the available drugs, the most commonly used for HTG are fibrates, nicotinic acid, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (usually a mixture of eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA, and docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA). These last are available under different concentrated formulations containing high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, including a mixture of EPA and DHA or pure EPA. The most recent formulation contains a free fatty acid (FFA) form of EPA and DHA, and exhibits a significantly higher bioavailability compared with the ethyl ester forms contained in the other formulations. This is due to the fact that the ethyl ester forms, to be absorbed, need to be hydrolyzed by the pancreatic enzymes that are secreted in response to fat intake, while the FFA do not. This higher bioavailability translates into a higher TG-lowering efficacy compared with the ethyl ester forms at equivalent doses. Omega-3 FFA are effective in reducing TG levels and other lipids in hypertriglyceridemic patients as well as in high cardiovascular risk patients treated with statins and residual HTG. Currently, omega-3 FFA formulation is under evaluation to establish whether, in high cardiovascular risk subjects, the addition of omega-3 to statin therapy may prevent or reduce major cardiovascular events.",Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,omega-3 fatty acids hypertriglyceridemia,1.0,Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,0.9478958249092102
125,2021,27444154,"Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides &gt; 150 mg/dL) affects ~25 % of the United States (US) population and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) is also a risk factor for pancreatitis. Three omega-3 fatty acid (OM3FA) prescription formulations are approved in the US for the treatment of adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia: (1) OM3FA ethyl esters (OM3EE), a mixture of OM3FA ethyl esters, primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (Lovaza®, Omtryg™, and generics); (2) icosapent ethyl (IPE), EPA ethyl esters (Vascepa®); and (3) omega-3 carboxylic acids (OM3CA), a mixture of OM3FAs in free fatty acid form, primarily EPA, DHA, and docosapentaenoic acid (Epanova®). At approved doses, all formulations substantially reduce triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein levels. DHA-containing formulations may also increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, this is not accompanied by increased non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which is thought to provide a better indication of cardiovascular risk in this patient population. Proposed mechanisms of action of OM3FAs include inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase, increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity, decreased hepatic lipogenesis, and increased hepatic β-oxidation. OM3CA bioavailability (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to the last measurable concentration) is up to 4-fold greater than that of OM3FA ethyl esters, and unlike ethyl esters, the absorption of OM3CA is not dependent on pancreatic lipase hydrolysis. All three formulations are well tolerated (the most common adverse events are gastrointestinal) and demonstrate a lack of drug-drug interactions with other lipid-lowering drugs, such as statins and fibrates.

125,2021,27981496,"Cardiovascular (CV) disease remains the leading cause of preventable death in the US. Hyperlipidemia is a major modifiable risk factor for CV disease, and after numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with statin therapy can prevent major adverse CV events, statins have emerged as the drug of choice to lower LDL cholesterol and reduce CV risk. However, some statin-treated patients remain at high residual risk of CV events despite achieving low LDL cholesterol levels, especially if their triglyceride (TG) levels are elevated or their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels low. Evidence from genetic and observational studies has linked elevated TG levels to an increased risk of CV events. Furthermore, very high TG levels are associated with acute pancreatitis. Consequently, several clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations for the management and treatment of high and very high TG levels. This review focuses on the clinical practice guidelines for the management of hypertriglyceridemia and the role of prescription omega-3 fatty acids in preventing pancreatitis and CV disease in individuals with high and very high TG levels.",Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,omega-3 fatty acids hypertriglyceridemia,1.0,Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,0.9997597336769104

125,2021,24124374,"The systemic bioavailability of free fatty acid (FFA) forms of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) compared with ethyl ester (EE) forms is dependent on the presence of intestinal lipases and is highest during consumption of high-fat meals. Given that patients with cardiovascular disease are advised to reduce dietary fat intake, potentially lowering the bioavailability and therapeutic benefit, the hypothesis that FFA forms provide for higher bioavailability compared with EE forms under low-fat diet conditions was tested where the pharmacokinetics of the FFA form (Epanova™) were compared with those of an ethyl ester form (Lovaza®) following repeat dosing. Fifty-two healthy male and female subjects were equally allocated to one of two open-label, parallel-group cohorts. Following a Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet for a minimum of 7 days, blood samples were drawn for endogenous values for EPA and DHA over a 24-hour period. Subjects were then administered 4 × 1 g capsules of either Epanova (OM3 FFA) or Lovaza (OM3 EE) once daily for 14 days, following which serial blood samples were drawn over a 24-hour period to characterize the bioavailability of EPA and DHA from the respective formulations. In addition, changes from baseline in lipid profile were explored. Systemic bioavailability, as measured by area under the curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC(0-τ)) and the maximum measured plasma concentrations during the 0-24 hour dosing interval (C(max,ss)) of unadjusted total plasma EPA + DHA were approximately 3-fold and 3.9-fold higher, respectively, for Epanova relative to Lovaza. Following baseline adjustment, the magnitude of difference in bioavailability was approximately 5.8-fold and 6.5-fold higher in AUC(0-τ) and C(max,ss), respectively, for Epanova relative to Lovaza. Serum triglycerides were reduced by a significantly greater extent (P = 0.013) for Epanova relative to Lovaza (21% versus 8%). The bioavailability of the FFA forms of EPA and DHA in Epanova are significantly greater than the bioavailability from the EE forms present in Lovaza under low-fat dietary conditions normally recommended for patients with cardiovascular disease.

Data sources: Two independent reviewers examined all RCTs from 1994 to 2003 identified in several databases, extracted data from each study, and used the previously tested Boyack and Lookinland Methodological Quality Index (MQI) to determine study quality. Conclusions: Ten studies reported long-chain omega-3 fatty acids to be effective in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. The average decrease in triglycerides was 29%, total cholesterol 11.6%, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) 30.2%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 32.5%. One study found LDLs to increase by 25%. The average increase in high-density lipoprotein was 10%. The overall average MQI score was 36% (range = 26% to 54%). Many of the RCTs had serious shortcomings, including short duration, lack of a power analysis, no intention-to-treat analysis, no report of blind assessment of outcome, and lack of dietary control as a confounding variable. Implications for practice: Overall study methodology was weak. Although the evidence supporting use of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in the secondary prevention of hypertriglyceridemia is reasonably strong, until there are larger RCTs of better methodological quality, it is not recommended that practitioners treat hypertriglyceridemia with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in lieu of lipid-lowering medications.",Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,omega-3 fatty acids hypertriglyceridemia,1.0,Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,0.004057961516082287

Even though the previous version of our review showed benefits of probiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), several new studies have been published. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose), compared with placebo, in the prevention of acute URTIs in people of all ages, who are at risk of acute URTIs. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to July week 3, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to July 2014), Web of Science (1900 to July 2014), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, which includes the China Biological Medicine Database (from 1978 to July 2014), the Chinese Medicine Popular Science Literature Database (from 2000 to July 2014) and the Masters Degree Dissertation of Beijing Union Medical College Database (from 1981 to July 2014). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for completed and ongoing trials on 31 July 2014. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics with placebo to prevent acute URTIs. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of trials, and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results: We included 13 RCTs, although we could only extract data to meta-analyze 12 trials, which involved 3720 participants including children, adults (aged around 40 years) and older people. We found that probiotics were better than placebo when measuring the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTI [at least one episode: odds ratio (OR): 0.53; 95% CI = 0.37-0.76, P .001, low quality evidence; at least three episodes: OR: 0.53; 95% CI = 0.36-0.80, P = .002, low quality evidence]; the mean duration of an episode of acute URTI [mean difference (MD): -1.89; 95% CI = -2.03 to -1.75, P .001, low quality evidence]; reduced antibiotic prescription rates for acute URTIs (OR: 0.65; 95% CI = 0.45-0.94, moderate quality evidence) and cold-related school absence (OR: 0.10; 95% CI = 0.02-0.47, very low quality evidence). Probiotics and placebo were similar when measuring the rate ratio of episodes of acute URTI (rate ratio: 0.83; 95% CI = 0.66-1.05, P = .12, very low quality evidence) and adverse events (OR: 0.88; 95% CI = 0.65-1.19, P = .40, low quality evidence). Side effects of probiotics were minor and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common. We found that some subgroups had a high level of heterogeneity when we conducted pooled analyses and the evidence level was low or very low quality. Authors' conclusions: Probiotics were better than placebo in reducing the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTI, the mean duration of an episode of acute URTI, antibiotic use and cold-related school absence.

The scope of these micro-organisms is broad, concerning many areas including that of infectious diseases, especially respiratory infections. We describe the rational use of probiotics in respiratory tract infections and detail the results of various clinical studies describing the use of probiotics in the management of respiratory infections such as nosocomial or community acquired pneumonia, or on specific grounds such as cystic fibrosis.

126,2021,24720809,"Background: The microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract have profound influence at multiple levels, even on the development and maintenance of lung immunity and inflammation. Aim of this review is to evaluate the current knowledge about the specific impact on children's respiratory tract infections from probiotics, live microbes with the power to modify intestinal microbial populations and exert subsequent benefits for the host. Discussion: The role of probiotics in gastrointestinal and allergic diseases has been largely assessed, but the number of studies performed so far in the field of respiratory tract infections is small, though some data show that probiotic administration might display clinical advantages. Probiotic strain identity and host genetic differences may account for differential modulation of immune responses by probiotics. Current laboratory and clinical data regarding the possibility of the role of probiotics on preventing the development of respiratory tract infections are contradictory, and are somewhat insufficient to recommend strongly their routine use. Further study of gastrointestinal-respiratory interactions is likely to yield important insights into the pathogenesis of different pulmonary diseases, and improve our knowledge in the prophylactic role of probiotics in children affected by recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. Summary: A better understanding of the effects of different probiotic strains and a deeper insight into their mechanisms of action are needed for the validation of specific strains carrying a potential to modify the frequency and severity of RTIs in infants and children. No data have been collected in pediatric patients with chronic underlying diseases, and yet there are no published data concerning treatment of RTIs with probiotics. The very few studies published so far do not indicate which micro-organism or administration regimen might exert beneficial effects as a prevention tool of RTIs both in healthy children and in those with recurrent RTIs. Further research to establish the role of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of RTIs, including those involving the lower respiratory tract, are required and should also clarify if any susceptible subgroups of respiratory diseases exist, and how these subgroups benefit from supplementation with certain probiotic strains.",Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,0.8210790157318115

The infection is also characterized by renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal dysfunctions suggesting the spread of the virus to other organs. A dysregulated immune response was also reported. To date, there is no measure to treat or prevent SARS CoV-2 infection. Additionally, as gut microbiota composition is altered in patients with COVID-19, alternative therapies using probiotics can be considered to fight SARS CoV-2 infection. This review aims at summarizing the current knowledge about next-generation probiotics (NGPs) and their benefits in viral respiratory tract infections and in COVID-19. We describe these bacteria, highlighted by studies using metagenomic approaches. In addition, these bacteria generate metabolites such as butyrate, desaminotyrosine, and secondary bile acid, suggested to prevent viral respiratory infections. Gut microbial metabolites transported via the circulation to the lungs could inhibit viral replication or improve the immune response against viruses. The use of probiotics and/or their metabolites may target either the virus itself and/or the immunologic process.

This similarity between the two organs may underlie why dysfunction in one organ may induce illness in the other.

Probiotics have been defined as ""live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits on the host."" In model systems probiotics regulate innate and inflammatory immune responses. Commonly used probiotics include lactic acid bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Saccharomyces, and these are often used as dietary supplements to provide a health benefit in gastrointestinal diseases including infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer. In this respect, probiotics probably act as immunomodulatory agents and activators of host defence pathways which suggest that they could influence disease severity and incidence at sites distal to the gut.

126,2021,36013241,"Mortality and morbidity from influenza and other respiratory viruses are significant causes of concern worldwide. Infections in the respiratory tract are often underappreciated because they tend to be mild and incapacitated. On the other hand, these infections are regarded as a common concern in clinical practice. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, albeit this is becoming more challenging since many of the more prevalent infection causes have acquired a wide range of antimicrobial resistance. Resistance to frontline treatment medications is constantly rising, necessitating the development of new antiviral agents. Probiotics are one of several medications explored to treat respiratory viral infection (RVI). As a result, certain probiotics effectively prevent gastrointestinal dysbiosis and decrease the likelihood of secondary infections. Various probiotic bacterias and their metabolites have shown immunomodulating and antiviral properties. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which probiotics are effective in the fight against viral infections are sometimes unclear. This comprehensive review has addressed probiotic strains, dosage regimens, production procedures, delivery systems, and pre-clinical and clinical research. In particular, novel probiotics' fight against RVIs is the impetus for this study. Finally, this review may explore the potential of probiotic bacterias and their metabolites to treat RVIs.

Objective: The aim of this open-label, parallel-group, quasi-randomized controlled pilot study was to investigate the effect of aromatherapy massage on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain and fatigue in patients receiving oxaliplatin. Methods: Stratified randomization was used to allocate 46 patients to 2 groups: intervention (n = 22) and control (n = 24). Between week 1 and week 6, participants in the intervention group (IG) received aromatherapy massage 3 times a week. There was no intervention in weeks 7 and 8. The control group (CG) received routine care. Neuropathic pain was identified using the Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions; severity of painful paresthesia was assessed with the numerical rating scale; fatigue severity was identified with the Piper Fatigue Scale. Results: At week 6, the rate of neuropathic pain was significantly lower in the IG, when compared with the CG. The severity of painful paresthesia based on numerical rating scale in the IG was significantly lower than that in the CG at weeks 2, 4, and 6. At week 8, fatigue severity in the IG was significantly lower when compared with CG (P .05).

Objective: In recent years, oral minoxidil at low dose has been proposed as a safe alternative. This study reviewed articles in which oral minoxidil was used to treat hair loss to determine its efficacy and safety as an alternative to topical minoxidil. Methods: PubMed searches were performed to identify articles discussing oral minoxidil as the primary form of treatment for hair loss published up to April 2020. Results: A total of 17 studies with 634 patients were found discussing the use of oral minoxidil as the primary treatment modality for hair loss. Androgenetic alopecia was the most studied condition, but other conditions included telogen effluvium, lichen planopilaris, loose anagen hair syndrome, monilethrix, alopecia areata, and permanent chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Limitations: Larger randomized studies comparing the efficacy/safety of different doses with standardized objective measurements will be needed to clarify the best treatment protocol.

Currently there are no comprehensive reviews on the clinical efficacy of minoxidil on hair loss. Method: A literature search was conducted to identify clinically relevant studies regarding the efficacy of topical minoxidil for human subjects for hair loss. Results: Twenty-three pertinent studies were identified for inclusion in this review. Topical minoxidil has been studied in concentrations ranging from 0.01% to 15% for the treatment of AGA resulting in hair growth ranging from 17% to 70%. Concentrations from 3% to 5% have been used to treat alopecia areata, 2% to treat traction alopecia, and 1% to 5% for congenital hair disorders with varying levels of treatment success. Efficacy varies by ethnic groups, but topical minoxidil has been demonstrated to significantly improve quality of life even in the absence of hair regrowth. Conclusion: Topical minoxidil is efficacious for the treatment of hair loss due to male and female androgenic alopecia, alopecia areata, with case-by-case application for traction alopecia, hair transplantation, and congenital hair disorders. Combination therapies using minoxidil with systemic, topical, and injectable therapies demonstrate increased effectiveness over monotherapies.

Objective: In addition, a better understanding of the regulation of the hair-growth cycle has led to advances in the pharmacologic treatment of androgenetic alopecia. Methods: Currently there are two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents that promote hair regrowth: over-the-counter topical minoxidil solution for men and women and prescription oral finasteride tablets for men. In October 2001, a group of 11 international experts on hair loss and hair transplantation convened to review the physiology and effects of pharmacologic treatments of hair loss and to discuss the value of administering topical minoxidil therapy as an adjunct to hair transplantation. Results: This article presents the key findings and consensus points among the participants, including their current use of pharmacologic treatments, strategies for optimal results both pre- and postsurgery, and the importance of realistic patient expectations and compliance.

129,2021,34159872,"Topical minoxidil (5% foam, 5% solution, and 2% solution) is FDA-approved for androgenetic alopecia (AGA) in men and women. Mechanism of action: Minoxidil acts through multiple pathways (vasodilator, anti-inflammatory agent, inducer of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, an antiandrogen), and may also affect the length of the anagen and telogen phases. Pharmacokinetics: Approximately 1.4% of topical minoxidil is absorbed through the skin. Minoxidil is a prodrug that is metabolized by follicular sulfotransferase to minoxidil sulfate (active form). Those with higher sulfotransferase activity may respond better than patients with lower sulfotransferase activity. Clinical efficacy (topical minoxidil): In a five-year study, 2% minoxidil exhibited peak hair growth in males at year one with a decline in subsequent years. Topical minoxidil causes hair regrowth in both frontotemporal and vertex areas. The 5% solution and foam were not significantly different in efficacy from the 2% solution. Oral and Sublingual minoxidil (not FDA approved; off-label): After 6 months of administration, minoxidil 5 mg/day was significantly more effective than topical 5% and 2% in male AGA.

This study is a triple-blind randomized clinical trial in which 72 women with FPHL were treated as two separate groups. Group 1 was treated with oral minoxidil 0.25 mg tablets and topical placebo solution, while topical minoxidil solutions and oral placebo tablets were used to treat group 2 patients. In the oral minoxidil group, the average hair diameter and hair density after the 9-month treatment reached from 0.044 mm and 102 per cm<sup>2</sup> to 0.048 mm and 115 per cm<sup>2</sup> , respectively. In the topical minoxidil group, the average hair diameter and hair density from initial values of 0.044 mm and 107 per cm<sup>2</sup> increased to 0.047 mm and 113 per cm<sup>2</sup> .

Topical minoxidil seems to normalize hair follicles and increase blood flow to the scalp. In clinical trials of various formulations, results have varied. Improved hair growth occurred after four to six months of therapy; twice-daily application seems to be indicated. The most frequently reported adverse reactions are mild scalp dryness and irritation and, rarely, allergic contact dermatitis. Current recommendations are to reserve topical minoxidil for patients with normal cardiovascular status and to routinely monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiographic changes. A new drug application is pending with FDA for use of topical minoxidil in androgenetic alopecia (male-pattern baldness), which is genetically determined and apparently stimulated by androgens. For alopecia areata, which involves hair loss on the body or scalp, usually patchy and of sudden onset, no reliable treatment has been found, although minoxidil may be efficacious in some patients.

The use of low-dose oral minoxidil for the treatment of male androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is receiving increasing attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral minoxidil for the treatment of male AGA. Methods: This was an open-label, prospective, single-arm study. Thirty men aged 24-59 years with AGA types III vertex to V were treated with oral minoxidil 5 mg once daily for 24 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated by hair counts, hair diameter measurements, photographic assessment, and self-administered questionnaire. The safety of the treatment was closely monitored by means of physical examinations and laboratory investigations. Results: There was a significant increase in total hair counts from baseline at weeks 12 (mean change + 26, range 182.5-208.5 hairs/cm<sup>2</sup>) and 24 (mean change + 35.1, range 182.5-217.6 hairs/cm<sup>2</sup>) (both p = 0.007). Photographic assessment of the vertex area by an expert panel revealed 100% improvement (score &gt; + 1), with 43% of patients showing excellent improvement (score + 3, 71-100% increase). The frontal area also showed a significant response but less than that of the vertex area. Common side effects were hypertrichosis (93% of patients) and pedal edema (10%). No serious cardiovascular adverse events and abnormal laboratory findings were observed. Conclusion: Oral minoxidil 5 mg once daily effectively increased hair growth in our male patients with AGA and had a good safety profile in healthy subjects.

Physicians placed great store in its power to persuade people to seek medical help as early as possible in the development of the disease, when it was most amenable to treatment; to maintain patients' loyalty through what could be a long, painful and uncertain course of therapy; and to encourage doubts about alternative healers. Some also argued that hope could have beneficial therapeutic and psychological effects for patients. However, we know very little about its meanings for the public. Focusing on a large collection of letters written to the Food and Drug Administration in the 1950s concerning an anti-quackery campaign, this article explores how men and women responded to the competing messages of hope promoted by orthodox cancer organizations and by alternative healers. It asks: What did hope mean to such men and women? How did they construct this meaning? How did they decide which treatments were hopeful and which were not?

Both L-theanine and caffeine, which green tea contains, have been highlighted for their beneficial effects on cognition and mood. Methods: In this study, we investigated the effects of orally administered L-theanine or caffeine on mental task performance and physiological activities under conditions of physical or psychological stress in humans. Fourteen participants each underwent three separate trials, in which they orally took either L-theanine + placebo, caffeine + placebo, or placebo only. Results: The results after the mental tasks showed that L-theanine significantly inhibited the blood-pressure increases in a high-response group, which consisted of participants whose blood pressure increased more than average by a performance of a mental task after placebo intake. Caffeine tended to have a similar but smaller inhibition of the blood-pressure increases caused by the mental tasks. The result of the Profile of Mood States after the mental tasks also showed that L-theanine reduced the Tension-Anxiety scores as compared with placebo intake.

Twelve participants underwent four separate trials: one in which they took L-Theanine at the start of an experimental procedure, one in which they took L-Theanine midway, and two control trials in which they either took a placebo or nothing. The experimental sessions were performed by double-blind, and the order of them was counterbalanced. The results showed that L-Theanine intake resulted in a reduction in the heart rate (HR) and salivary immunoglobulin A (s-IgA) responses to an acute stress task relative to the placebo control condition. Moreover, analyses of heart rate variability indicated that the reductions in HR and s-IgA were likely attributable to an attenuation of sympathetic nervous activation.

131,2021,28971241,"Rationale and objectives: The amino acid L-theanine (N-ethyl-L-glutamine) has historically been considered a relaxing agent. In the present study, we examined the effects of repeated L-theanine administration on behavior, levels of amino acids in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and hippocampal activity in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, an animal model of anxiety and depressive disorders. Methods: Behavioral tests were performed after 7-10 days of L-theanine (0.4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) or saline administration, followed by CSF sampling for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. An independent set of animals was subjected to [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scanning after the same dose of L-theanine or saline administration for 7 days. Results: In the elevated plus maze test, the time spent in the open arms was significantly longer in the L-theanine group than in the saline group (P = 0.035). In addition, significantly lower CSF glutamate (P = 0.039) and higher methionine (P = 0.024) concentrations were observed in the L-theanine group than in the saline group. A significant increase in the standard uptake value ratio was observed in the hippocampus/cerebellum of the L-theanine group (P 0.001). Conclusions: These results suggest that L-theanine enhances hippocampal activity and exerts anxiolytic effects, which may be mediated by changes in glutamate and methionine levels in the brain.

Effects on stress-related quality-of-life parameters (sleep and perception of pain) were also explored. Adults with stress for ≥1 month, scoring ≥14 points on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)-42 questionnaire, were randomized (1:1) to receive oral Mg-Teadiola ( n = 49) or a placebo ( n = 51), for 28 days, with a follow-up assessment on Day 56 (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04391452"" title=""See in ClinicalTrials.gov"">NCT04391452</a>). The primary endpoint was the change in the DASS-42 stress score from baseline to Day 28 with Mg-Teadiola versus placebo. The DASS-42 stress scores significantly decreased from baseline to Day 28 with Mg-Teadiola versus placebo (effect size, 0.29; 95% CI [0.01, 0.57]; p = 0.04). Similar reductions were observed on Day 14 ( p = 0.006) and Day 56 ( p = 0.02). A significant reduction in sensitivity to cold pain ( p = 0.01) and a trend for lower sensitivity to warm pain was observed ( p = 0.06) on Day 28.

131,2021,31145971,"Meta-analyses of tea consumption and reduced risk of Parkinson's disease have thrown light in the pathway of exploring beneficial properties of tea components. On the basis of dry mass, a typical black or green tea beverage contains approximately 6% of free amino acids, which impart high quality, taste and distinctive aroma to the tea infusion. L-theanine (chemically known as γ-glutamylethylamide) is a non-proteinogenic amino acid of tea that takes part in the biosynthesis of its polyphenols. Recently discovered neuroprotective effects of L-theanine can be attributed to its structural analogy with glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in brain. This unique amino acid also bears a potential to ameliorate the pathophysiological changes associated with Parkinson's disease as it displays antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, improves motor behavioral abnormalities, increases dopamine availability and may cause a favorable downshift in neurodegeneration due to glutamate excitotoxicity. To gain an explicit understanding of the role of L-theanine, this review article is the first one to focus on its mechanism of neuromodulatory action and to critically evaluate the possibilities of employing this bioactive amide in the forage of anti-Parkinsonian medication. We also hypothesize the idea of L-theanine being a potent natural agent against L-DOPA induced dyskinesia, since long-term reliance on dopamine replacement therapy is linked with elevation in glutamate receptor activity.",Can l-theanine supplements reduce stress and anxiety?,l-theanine supplements anxiety,1.0,Can l-theanine supplements reduce stress and anxiety?,0.9851994514465332

Steam inhalation has the potential to and has caused significant scald injuries, predominantly due to unintentional contact with the hot water used. Methods: The authors used electronic health records to retrospectively identify all patients admitted with scald injuries secondary to steam inhalation over a 2-year period from January 2018-December 2019 at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, a regional burns centre. Data collected included patient demographics, mechanism of burn, as well as burn size, depth, treatment and any associated complications. An International Burns Injury Database enquiry assessed the national prevalence steam inhalation scalds over the same time period. Results: 19 adult and paediatric patients were identified in our centre over a 2-year period, with an age range of 2 weeks to 91 years old. The majority (16/19, 84%) of patients received burns to their lower body, with three patients receiving burns to their chest and/or upper limbs. Six patients underwent surgery, 98 clinic appointments were utilised and the total length of hospital stay was 83 days. The estimated total cost of treating these 19 patients was over £31,872. Nationally, 201 cases were identified between Jan 2018-Dec 2019. Conclusions: Scald injuries secondary to steam inhalation have a significant impact both in terms of hospital stay and cost. Since this study captured only patients admitted to hospital, the true negative impact of steam inhalation is likely to be much higher than calculated.

Depression is recognised as a mood state, clinical syndrome and psychiatric condition, and traditional methods for assessing depression (e.g. standard interviews, questionnaires) are described. In order to place exercise therapy into context, more established methods for treating clinical depression are discussed. Observational (e.g. cross-sectional and correlational) and interventional studies of exercise are reviewed in healthy adults, those with comorbid medical conditions, and patients with major depression. Potential mechanisms by which exercise may reduce depression are described, and directions for future research in the area are suggested. The available evidence provides considerable support for the value of exercise in reducing depressive symptoms in both healthy and clinical populations.

133,2021,35578192,"Background: Symptoms of depression are prevalent in people living with human immune deficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (PLWHA), and worsened by lack of physical activity/exercises, leading to restriction in social participation/functioning. This raises the question: what is the extent to which physical exercise training affected, symptoms of depression, physical activity level (PAL) and social participation in PLWHA compared to other forms of intervention, usual care, or no treatment controls? Method: Eight databases were searched up to July 2020, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol. Only randomised controlled trials involving adults who were either on HAART/HAART-naïve and reported in the English language, were included. Two independent reviewers determined the eligibility of the studies, extracted data, assessed their quality, and risk of bias using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) tool. Standardised mean difference (SMD) was used as summary statistics for the mean primary outcome (symptoms of depression) and secondary outcomes (PAL and social participation) since different measuring tools/units were used across the included studies. Summary estimates of effects were determined using a random-effects model (I<sup>2</sup>). Results: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria with 779 participants (n = 596 participants at study completion) randomised into the study groups, comprising 378 males, 310 females and 91 participants with undisclosed gender, and with an age range of 18-86 years. Across the studies, aerobic or aerobic plus resistance exercises were performed 2-3 times/week, at 40-60 min/session, and for between 6-24 weeks, and the risk of bias vary from high to low. Comparing the intervention to control groups showed significant difference in the symptoms of depression (SMD = - 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 1.01, - 0.48, p ≤ 0.0002; I<sup>2</sup> = 47%; 5 studies; 205 participants) unlike PAL (SMD = 0.98, 95% CI - 0.25, 2.17, p = 0.11; I<sup>2</sup> = 82%; 2 studies; 62 participants) and social participation (SMD = 0.04, 95% CI - 0.65, 0.73, p = 0.91; I<sup>2</sup> = 90%; 6 studies; 373 participants).

133,2021,32491278,"Depression is a common mental disorder characterized by high incidence, high disability, and high fatality, causing great burden to the society, families, and individuals. The changes in brain plasticity may be a main reason for depression. Recent studies have shown that exercise plays a positive role in depression, but systematic and comprehensive studies are lacking on brain plasticity changes in depression. To further understand the antidepressive effect of exercise and the changes in brain plasticity, we retrieved related literatures using key words ""depression,"" ""depressive disorder,"" ""exercise,"" ""brain plasticity,"" ""brain structure,"" and ""brain function"" from the database of Web of Science, PubMed, EBSCO host, and CNKI, hoping to provide evidence for exercise in preventing and treating depression. Increase in exercise has been found negatively correlated with the risk of depression. Randomized controlled experiments have shown that aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and mind-body exercise can improve depressive symptoms and levels. The intensity and long-term effect of exercise are now topical research issues. Exercise has been proven to reshape the brain structure of depression patients, activate the function of related brain areas, promote behavioral adaptation changes, and maintain the integrity of hippocampal and white matter volume, thus improving the brain neuroprocessing and delaying cognitive degradation in depression patients.

133,2021,34803752,"Background: It is necessary to seek alternative therapies for depression, because side effects of medications lead to poor adherence and some patients do not achieve a clinical treatment effect. Recently the role of exercise as a low-cost and easy-to-use treatment for depression has gained attention with a number of studies showing that exercise is effective at reducing depressive symptoms and improving body functions such as cardiorespiratory system and cognitive function. Because of the heterogeneity of exercise therapy programs, there is no standardized and unified program. Few studies have summarized the specific properties of exercise programs (type, intensity, duration, and frequency) and clinical prescriptions for exercise are not mentioned in most articles. Aims: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of exercise therapy for patients with depression, in order to appraise the evidence and outline accepted guidelines to direct individualized treatment plans for patients with depression based on their individual situations. Methods: A systematic review of English language literature including papers published from 2010 to present in PubMed was performed. Given the feasibility of prescribing exercise therapy for patients with depression, nearly 3 years of clinical studies on the treatments of depressive symptoms with exercise were first reviewed, comparing the exercise programs utilized. Conclusions: Exercise has therapeutic effects on depression in all age groups (mostly 18-65 years old), as a single therapy, an adjuvant therapy, or a combination therapy, and the benefits of exercise therapy are comparable to traditional treatments for depression. Moderate intensity exercise is enough to reduce depressive symptoms, but higher-dose exercise is better for overall functioning. Exercise therapy has become more widely used because of its benefits to the cardiovascular system, emotional state, and systemic functions. Recommendations: Aerobic exercise/mind-body exercise (3-5 sessions per week with moderate intensity lasting for 4-16 weeks) is recommended. Individualized protocols in the form of group exercise with supervision are effective at increasing adherence to treatment.",Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,exercise depression,1.0,Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,0.9996656179428101

133,2021,10739267,"Physical activity may play an important role in the management of mild-to-moderate mental health diseases, especially depression and anxiety. Although people with depression tend to be less physically active than non-depressed individuals, increased aerobic exercise or strength training has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms significantly. However, habitual physical activity has not been shown to prevent the onset of depression. Anxiety symptoms and panic disorder also improve with regular exercise, and beneficial effects appear to equal meditation or relaxation. In general, acute anxiety responds better to exercise than chronic anxiety. Studies of older adults and adolescents with depression or anxiety have been limited, but physical activity appears beneficial to these populations as well. Excessive physical activity may lead to overtraining and generate psychological symptoms that mimic depression. Several differing psychological and physiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effect of physical activity on mental health disorders. Well controlled studies are needed to clarify the mental health benefits of exercise among various populations and to address directly processes underlying the benefits of exercise on mental health.",Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,exercise depression,1.0,Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,0.9997079968452454
133,2021,19104978,"There has been considerable research interest in the effects of exercise upon depression outcomes. Recently, health agencies in the United Kingdom (UK) and beyond have made several guidance statements on this issue. Therefore, this review seeks to provide a synthesis of evidence regarding the effectiveness of exercise in the management of depression (including postnatal depression) in adults. Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) and PsychINFO using relevant search terms. The article describes how meta-analyses from peer reviewed journals have reported exercise as treatment for depression is more effective than no treatment, as effective as traditional interventions in some instances, possibly a promising approach to postnatal depression and has equivalent adherence rates to medication. However, reviews have also raised concerns about the methodological quality of trials, possible overestimation of treatment effects and lack of data regarding long term benefits. Based on the available evidence it is concluded that while awaiting further high quality trial evidence it would seem appropriate for exercise to be recommended in combination with other treatments.",Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,exercise depression,1.0,Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,0.9997962117195129
133,2021,30949079,"Background: The beneficial effects of exercise training on depressive symptoms are well-established. In the past years, more research attention has been drawn to the specific effects of exercise training on depressive symptoms in somatically ill patients. This reviews aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the current findings and evidence of exercise interventions in somatic disorders to improve depressive symptoms. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed and Cochrane databases and extracted meta-analyses from somatically ill patients that underwent exercise interventions and provided information about the outcome of depressive symptoms. Results: Of the 4123 detected publications, 39 were selected for final analysis. Various diseases were included (breast-cancer, prostate cancer, mixed-cancer, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hemodialysis, fibromyalgia syndrome, acute leukemia, other hematological malignancies, heart failure, HIV, multiple sclerosis, mixed neurological disorders, Parkinson's disease, stroke, ankylosing spondylitis, traumatic brain injury, lupus erythematodes). Most meta-analyses (33/39) found beneficial effects on depressive symptoms, but quality of the included studies as well as duration, intensity, frequency, and type of exercise varied widely. Conclusion: Exercise training has the potential to improve depressive symptoms in patients with somatic disorders.

We used a mixed methods study with qualitative interviews and a quantitative web survey. Interviews with topic experts and members of the public suggested that predictors of tick checking included perceived disease likelihood and severity as well as overall awareness of ticks and tick-borne disease. Twenty-four percent of participants regularly checked for ticks after walking in a tick-endemic area. The strongest predictors of checking for ticks were greater levels of knowledge, perceived likelihood of being bitten, self-efficacy about tick removal, and lower levels of disgust about ticks. Barriers to checking included forgetfulness and lacking time. At-risk members of the UK public require information to increase awareness of ticks and protective behaviours, particularly tick checking.

134,2021,32426219,"Hosts are typically co-parasitized by multiple species. Parasites can benefit or suffer from the presence of other parasites, which can reduce or increase the overall virulence due to competition or facilitation. Outcomes of new multi-parasite systems are seldom predictable. In 1994 the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum jumped from poultry to songbirds in which it caused an epidemic throughout North America. Songbirds are often parasitized by hard ticks, and can act as reservoirs for tick-borne pathogens. We tested the hypothesis that Mycoplasma infection in house finches influences North America's most important tick vector Ixodes scapularis , by affecting the tick's feeding success, detachment behaviour and survival to the next stage. Most ticks detached during the daylight hours irrespective of the bird's disease status and time since infestation. Birds incrementally invested in anti-tick resistance mechanisms over the course of the experiment; this investment was made earlier in the Mycoplasma -infected birds. At higher tick densities, the feeding success on birds with more severe conjunctivitis was lower than in the uninfected birds. Throughout the experiment we found positive density dependent effects on the tick's feeding success. More diseased hosts suffered more from the tick infestations, as shown by reduced haematocrits. Three Mycoplasma -infected birds died during the weeks following the experiment, although all birds were kept in optimal housing conditions. Mycoplasma made the bird a less accessible and valuable host for ticks, which is an example of ecological interference. Therefore, Mycoplasma has the potential to ultimately reduce transmission outcomes of tick-borne pathogens via songbird hosts.",Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,remove tick with vaseline,0.0,Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,0.4874095022678375
134,2021,35623316,"In non-permanent parasites, host detachment should take place in an environment that ensures the continuation of their life cycle. Timing of detachment - in combination with the host's space use - affects dispersal and transmission success of the parasites and of the pathogens they vector. Before reaching the adult reproductive stage, ticks need to go through multiple immature developmental stages (larva and nymph), each feeding on host blood. In between the feeding bouts, they often remain in the off-host environment for considerable periods of time. With this study, we aimed to obtain more insight in Ixodes frontalis' off-host habitat use by comparing its detachment pattern in different life stages with that of two habitat-specialized ticks also found on birds: the endophilic tree-hole tick (Ixodes arboricola) and the exophilic sheep tick (Ixodes ricinus), the latter living in humid understory vegetation of forests. For this, we artificially infested hole-roosting (great tits, Parus major) and open-roosting (blackbirds, Turdus merula) birds with ticks under laboratory conditions, and recorded whether detachment occurred during the day or the night. We hypothesize that nocturnal detachment improves off-host mating opportunities and host localization, whereas diurnal detachment optimizes tick dispersal. Ixodes frontalis nymphs detached during the night, especially when feeding on blackbirds. This behaviour was very similar to that of I. arboricola (larva and nymph) feeding on great tits. In contrast, I. frontalis larvae detached during the day, especially when feeding on great tits, which resembles that of I. ricinus' feeding behaviour (larva and nymph). Ixodes frontalis left the host within seven days, immediately after completion of the blood meal. This is similar to both developmental stages of I. ricinus but contrasts with the very long (up to 20 days) feeding duration in I. arboricola. Thus I. frontalis shows strong plasticity, switching from dispersal-centered (larvae) to host-centered (nymphs) detachment behaviour. Findings are discussed with regard to the ticks' habitat use, dispersal, life history and host specificity.",Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,remove tick with vaseline,0.0,Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,0.37571990489959717
134,2021,23339971,"In the European Union (EU), tick repellents for humans need to be registered and approved by the authorities in order to be marketed. As there are currently no specific technical guidelines for product evaluation, we compared 3 different test methods: the mechanical moving object bioassay (MOB), and 2 assays involving human volunteers. For the latter, procedures according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Stiftung Warentest (StiWa), a German consumer care organization, were used. Two repellents, Autan(®) (AU), based on 20% Picaridin [2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperidinecarboxylic acid-1-methylpropyl ester], and ZeckWeck (ZW), based on 12.5g/100g Citriodiol™ (main compound: p-menthane-3,8-diol) were tested with all 3 assays. Three repellents, Anti Brumm(®) naturelle, based on 20% Citriodiol™ (main compound: p-menthane-3,8-diol), G090141, based on 20% EBAAP (ethyl buthyl acetyl aminopropionate), and G090152, based on 10% decanoic acid (capric acid), which is contained in Zanzarin(®), were tested according to the EPA and the StiWa procedures. The EPA assay indicated a significantly higher repellency of the products AU and G090141 than the StiWa test, but no difference between assays could be detected for the remaining 3 products. Also the corresponding protection times were significantly longer (approximately 4h) when determined according to EPA versus to StiWa for 3 of the products, whilst the difference was insignificant for ZW and G090152. Additionally, significantly lower numbers of ticks initially walked onto the repellent-treated skin when tested according to EPA versus to StiWa in all products except ZW and G090152. Thus, the StiWa protocol appears to pose higher demands on a repellent than the EPA method. Contrary to expectation, the MOB showed the same or even lower product efficacy when compared to the EPA and StiWa tests. Particularly, the percentage of ticks clinging to repellent-treated filter paper was significantly higher than the proportion of ticks walking onto treated skin in the other assays. This could mean that in nature more ticks may probably cling to a human protected by a given repellent than the EPA or the StiWa assay might suggest.

The ticks have contrasting ecologies but share songbird hosts (such as the great tit, Parus major) with the generalist I. ricinus which may therefore act as a bridging vector. In the first phase of the experiment, we obtained Borrelia-infected ornithophilic nymphs by exposing larvae to great tits that had previously been exposed to I. ricinus nymphs carrying a community of genospecies (Borrelia garinii, valaisiana, afzelii, burgdorferi s.s., spielmanii). Skin samples showed that birds selectively amplified B. garinii and B. valaisiana. The spirochetes were transmitted to the ornithophilic ticks and survived moulting, leading to infection rates of 16% and 27% in nymphs of I. arboricola and I. frontalis respectively. In the second phase, pathogen-free great tits were exposed to the Borrelia-infected ornithophilic nymphs. None of these ticks were able to infect the birds, as indicated by the tissue samples. Analysis of xenodiagnostic I. ricinus larvae found no evidence for co-feeding or systemic transmission of B. burgdorferi s.l.

134,2021,33168347,"Tick-borne diseases pose a global medical problem. As transmission of tick-borne pathogens to their hosts occurs during tick feeding, development of vaccines thwarting this process could potentially prevent transmission of multiple tick-borne pathogens. The idea of tick vaccines is based on the phenomenon of acquired tick immunity, rejection of ticks feeding on hosts which were repeatedly infested by ticks. Recently, we demonstrated that saliva of the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis, which is the main vector of tick-borne pathogens in northeast USA, is sufficient for induction of tick immunity in the guinea pig model and that immunity directed against tick glycoproteins is important in this phenomenon. Nevertheless, immunity elicited against individual tick salivary antigens, which have been identified and tested so far, provided only modest tick rejection. We therefore now tested fractions of tick saliva produced by liquid chromatography for their ability to induce tick immunity in the guinea pig model. Immunization with all individual fractions elicited antibodies that reacted with tick saliva, however only some fractions displayed the ability to induce robust protective tick immunity. Mass spectrometry analysis led to identification of 24 proteins present only in saliva fractions which were able to induce tick immunity, suggesting suitable candidates for development of a tick vaccine.",Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,remove tick with vaseline,0.0,Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,0.004764774348586798

136,2021,34627344,"Background: The traditional spoon-feeding approach to introduction of solid foods during the complementary feeding period is supported by consensus in the scientific literature. However, a method called Baby-Led Introduction to SolidS (BLISS) has been proposed as an alternative, allowing infants to self-feed with no adult interference. To date, there have been no trials in the Brazilian population to evaluate the effectiveness of BLISS in comparison to the traditional approach. Methods/design: To evaluate and compare three different complementary feeding methods. Data on 144 mother-child pairs will be randomized into intervention groups by methods: (A) strict Parent-Led Weaning; (B) strict Baby-Led Introduction to SolidS; and (C) a mixed method. Prospective participants from Porto Alegre, Brazil, and nearby cities will be recruited through the Internet. The interventions will be performed by nutritionists and speech therapists, at 5.5 months of age of the child, at a private nutrition office equipped with a test kitchen where meals will be prepared according to the randomized method. The pairs will be followed up at 7, 9, and 12 months of age. Data will be collected through questionnaires designed especially for this study, which will include a 24h child food recall, questionnaires on the child's and parents' eating behavior, oral habits, eating difficulties, and choking prevalence. At 12 months of age, children will undergo blood collection to measure hemoglobin, ferritin, and C-reactive protein, saliva collection for analysis of genetic polymorphisms, and oral examination. Anthropometric parameters (child and maternal) will be measured at the baseline intervention, at a 9 month home visit, and at the end-of-study visit at the hospital. The primary outcome will be child growth and nutritional status z-scores at 12 months; secondary outcomes will include iron status, feeding behavior, acceptability of the methods, dietary variety, choking, eating behaviors, food preferences, acceptance of bitter and sweet flavors, suction, oral habits, oral hygiene behavior, dental caries, gingival health status, and functional constipation. Discussion: The trial intends to ascertain whether there are potential advantages to the BLISS complementary feeding method in this specific population, generating data to support families and healthcare providers.

We then tested a variety of rinse solutions on both Atlantic and Pacific Physalia species to determine if they elicit cnidae discharge, further investigating any that did not cause immediate significant discharge to determine if they are able to inhibit cnidae discharge in response to chemical and physical stimuli. We found commercially available vinegars, as well as the recently developed Sting No More<sup>®</sup> Spray, were the most effective rinse solutions, as they irreversibly inhibited cnidae discharge.

This review aimed to discuss studies that investigated the impact of vinegar intake on the glycemic profile in humans and the putative mechanistic cellular pathways in both human and animal models. A search of literature was performed on the Cochrane, MEDLINE and Web of Science databases for articles published between 1995 and 2018. There is considerable support for vinegar having a positive acute effect on blood glucose levels when combined with carbohydrate-rich meals. Conversely, there are few chronic interventions analyzing the impact of vinegar intake on blood glucose. Based on available evidence, we hypothesize three pathways by which vinegar may improve blood glucose: The inhibition of α-amylase action; increased glucose uptake; and mediation by transcription factors.

The investigations were performed in five groups: sham, ovariectomized (OVX) rats without treatment, low-dose RC vinegar (LRV)-treated OVX rats, high-dose RC vinegar (HRV)-treated OVX rats and alendronate (ALEN)-treated OVX rats. The efficacy of RC vinegar was evaluated using physical, biochemical, histological and metabolomic parameters. Compared to the OVX rats, the LRV and HRV groups showed positive effects on the aforementioned parameters, indicating estrogen regulation. Plasma metabolome analysis of the groups using gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-TOF-MS (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) with multivariate analysis revealed 19 and 16 metabolites, respectively. Notably, the levels of butyric acid, phenylalanine, glucose, tryptophan and some lysophosphatidylcholines were marginally increased in RC vinegar-treated groups compared to OVX. However, the pattern of metabolite levels in RC vinegar-treated groups was found similar to ALEN, but differed significantly from that in sham group.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zinc for such use. Methods: We searched electronic databases and other sources for studies published through to Sept. 30, 2011. We included all randomized controlled trials comparing orally administered zinc with placebo or no treatment. Assessment for study inclusion, data extraction and risk-of-bias analyses were performed in duplicate. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model. Results: We included 17 trials involving a total of 2121 participants. Compared with patients given placebo, those receiving zinc had a shorter duration of cold symptoms (mean difference -1.65 days, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.50 to -0.81); however, heterogeneity was high (I(2) = 95%). Zinc shortened the duration of cold symptoms in adults (mean difference -2.63, 95% CI -3.69 to -1.58), but no significant effect was seen among children (mean difference -0.26, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.25).

Physical barriers and innate and adaptive immunity have been involved during a CC episode. Vitamins C and D, zinc, and Echinacea have evidence-based efficacy on these immune system barriers. This review includes 82 eligible studies to consider the preventive role of these nutrients in immune clusters and in CC to provide advice on dosage and assumption of these nutrients. Regarding vitamin C, regular supplementation (1 to 2 g/day) has shown that vitamin C reduces the duration (in adults by 8%, in children by 14%) and the severity of CC. Considering zinc, the supplementation may shorten the duration of colds by approximately 33%. CC patients may be instructed to try zinc within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. As for vitamin D, the supplementation protected against CC overall, considering baseline levels and age. Patients with vitamin D deficiency and those not receiving bolus doses experienced the most benefit. Regarding Echinacea , prophylactic treatment with this extract (2400 mg/day) over 4 months appeared to be beneficial for preventing/treating CC.

Data sources: A literature search was undertaken in the Cochrane register of controlled trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Inclusion criteria were randomised placebo controlled trials in patients with a common cold. Results: Five studies were found. Three were relevant to the issue of treatment of common colds with intranasal zinc and the results were combined in meta-analysis. High doses of intranasal zinc preparation (2.1 mg zinc/day) were reported in two studies to shorten the duration and reduce the symptom severity of common cold in healthy adults, when started within 24 to 48 hours of onset of illness. A lower dose study (0.044 mg zinc/day) found no benefit in resolution, but did report a significant improvement in symptoms at day 1 and day 3.

139,2021,24066023,"Background: Folklore remedies for pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis include the application of magnets and copper to the skin. Despite the popular use of devices containing magnets or copper for this purpose, little research has been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of such treatments. Objective: To investigate whether the practice of wearing magnetic wrists straps, or copper bracelets, offers any specific therapeutic benefit for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Design: Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Methods: 70 patients, aged 33 to 79 years and predominantly female (n = 52), with painful rheumatoid arthritis were recruited from general practices within Yorkshire. Participants were randomly allocated to wear four devices in a different order. Devices tested were: a standard (1502 to 2365 gauss) magnetic wrist strap, a demagnetised ( 20 gauss) wrist strap, an attenuated (250 to 350 gauss) magnetic wrist strap, and a copper bracelet. Devices were each worn for five weeks, with treatment phases being separated by one week wash-out periods. The primary outcome measured was pain using a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Secondary pain measures were the McGill Pain Questionnaire and tender joint count. Inflammation was assessed using C-reactive protein and plasma viscosity blood tests and by swollen joint count. Physical function was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (Disability Index). Disease activity and medication use was also measured. Results: 65 participants provided complete self-report outcome data for all devices, four participants provided partial data. Analysis of treatment outcomes did not reveal any statistically significant differences (P&gt;0.05) between the four devices in terms of their effects on pain, inflammation, physical function, disease activity, or medication use.

139,2021,18789135,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis is a common inflammatory autoimmune disease. Although disease activity may be managed effectively with prescription drugs, unproven treatments such as magnet therapy are sometimes used as an adjunct for pain control. Therapeutic devices incorporating permanent magnets are widely available and easy to use. Magnets may also be perceived as a more natural and less harmful alternative to analgesic compounds. Of interest to health service researchers is the possibility that magnet therapy might help to reduce the economic burden of managing chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Magnets are extremely cheap to manufacture and prolonged treatment involves a single cost. Despite this, good quality scientific evidence concerning the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of magnet therapy is scarce. The primary aim of the CAMBRA trial is to investigate the effectiveness of magnet therapy for relieving pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. Methods/design: The CAMBRA trial employs a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Participant will each wear four devices: a commercially available magnetic wrist strap; an attenuated wrist strap; a demagnetised wrist strap; and a copper bracelet. Device will be allocated in a randomised sequence and each worn for five weeks. The four treatment phases will be separated by wash out periods lasting one week. Both participants and researchers will be blind, as far as feasible, to the allocation of experimental and control devices. In total 69 participants will be recruited from general practices within the UK. Eligible patients will have a verified diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis that is being managed using drugs, and will be experiencing chronic pain. Outcomes measured will include pain, inflammation, disease activity, physical function, medication use, affect, and health related costs. Data will be collected using questionnaires, diaries, manual pill counts and blood tests. Discussion: Magnetism is an inherent property of experimental devices which is hard to conceal. The use of multiple control devices, including a copper bracelet, represents a concerted attempt to overcome methodological limitations associated with trials in this field.

This involved wearing 'copper bracelets' and placebo bracelets (amodised aluminum resembling copper) alternately. These groups, as also a control group, answered questionnaires. The copper bracelets were weighed before and after use. Preliminary results show that, to a significant number of subjects, the wearing of the 'copper bracelet' appeared to have some therapeutic value. A study of the components of sweat and the solubility of copper in sweat was carried out. In five sweat samples, the copper concentration was of the order 2 x 10(-5) M and after equilibrating with copper turnings at room temperature for 24 hours the samples turned blue in colour and contained approximately 2 x 10(-3) M copper. The permeability of skin to copper containing solutions has also been discussed. It has also been shown that the wearing of a 'copper bracelet' results in a weight loss in excess of the body's total burden of copper (100-150 mg). A pair of copper bracelets lost 80 mg in 50 days when worn around the ankles and a copper bracelet worn around the wrist also lost about 90 mg in that time.",Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,copper bracelets reduce pain,0.0,Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,0.7551391124725342
139,2021,19942103,"Objectives: To test the effectiveness of a typical magnetic wrist strap for reducing pain and stiffness, and for improving physical functioning amongst patients with osteoarthritis. Design: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Each participant wore four devices over a 16-week period. Setting: Forty five patients with osteoarthritis were recruited from general practices in rural and urban areas of Yorkshire. Interventions: Experimental device: a commercially available magnetic wrist strap. Control devices: a weak magnetic wrist strap, a demagnetised wrist strap, and a copper bracelet. Main outcome measures: The WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index, the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Pain Rating Index (PRI), a pain visual analogue scale (VAS), and medication use. Results: No difference was observed between devices in terms of their effects on pain as measured by the primary outcome measure (WOMAC A), the PRI and the VAS. Similar results were obtained for stiffness (WOMAC B), physical function (WOMAC C), and medication use. Further analyses of the PRI subscales revealed a statistically significant difference between devices (P=0.025), which favoured the experimental device. Participants reported lower sensory pain after wearing the standard magnetic wrist strap, than when wearing control devices. However, no adjustment was made for multiple testing. Conclusions: Our results indicate that magnetic and copper bracelets are generally ineffective for managing pain, stiffness and physical function in osteoarthritis. Reported therapeutic benefits are most likely attributable to non-specific placebo effects. However such devices have no major adverse effects and may provide hope.",Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,copper bracelets reduce pain,0.0,Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,0.2490205019712448
139,2021,22923762,"Objective: To critically review the evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of practitioner-based complementary therapies for patients with osteoarthritis. We excluded t'ai chi and acupuncture, which have been the subject of recent reviews. Methods: Randomized controlled trials, published in English up to May 2011, were identified using systematic searches of bibliographic databases and searching of reference lists. Information was extracted on outcomes, statistical significance in comparison with alternative treatments and reported side effects. The methodological quality of the identified studies was determined using the Jadad scoring system. Outcomes considered were pain and patient global assessment. Results: In all, 16 eligible trials were identified covering 12 therapies. Overall, there was no good evidence of the effectiveness of any of the therapies in relation to pain or global health improvement/quality of life because most therapies only had a single randomized controlled trial. Where positive results were reported, they were often comparing an active intervention with no intervention. Therapies with multiple trials either provided null (biofeedback) or inconsistent results (magnet therapy), or the trials available scored poorly for quality (chiropractic). There were few adverse events reported in the trials. Conclusion: There is not sufficient evidence to recommend any of the practitioner-based complementary therapies considered here for the management of OA, but neither is there sufficient evidence to conclude that they are not effective or efficacious.",Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,copper bracelets reduce pain,0.0,Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,0.3095968961715698

139,2021,17893349,"Background: Static magnets are marketed with claims of effectiveness for reducing pain, although evidence of scientific principles or biological mechanisms to support such claims is limited. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical evidence from randomized trials of static magnets for treating pain. Methods: Systematic literature searches were conducted from inception to March 2007 for the following data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), CINAHL, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and the UK National Research Register. All randomized clinical trials of static magnets for treating pain from any cause were considered. Trials were included only if they involved a placebo control or a weak magnet as the control, with pain as an outcome measure. The mean change in pain, as measured on a 100-mm visual analogue scale, was defined as the primary outcome and was used to assess the difference between static magnets and placebo. Results: Twenty-nine potentially relevant trials were identified. Nine randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing pain with a visual analogue scale were included in the main meta-analysis; analysis of these trials suggested no significant difference in pain reduction (weighted mean difference [on a 100-mm visual analogue scale] 2.1 mm, 95% confidence interval -1.8 to 5.9 mm, p = 0.29). This result was corroborated by sensitivity analyses excluding trials of acute effects and conditions other than musculoskeletal conditions. Analysis of trials that assessed pain with different scales suggested significant heterogeneity among the trials, which means that pooling these data is unreliable. Interpretation: The evidence does not support the use of static magnets for pain relief, and therefore magnets cannot be recommended as an effective treatment. For osteoarthritis, the evidence is insufficient to exclude a clinically important benefit, which creates an opportunity for further investigation.",Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,copper bracelets reduce pain,0.0,Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,0.2831759452819824

The purpose of the study was to estimate the serum copper levels in rheumatoid arthritis patients and to see its association with the various parameters of disease activity. Materials and methods: The study was carried out among 50 diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis patients (25 each of active disease &amp; remission patients) and 50 age and sex matched controls. Fasting blood sample was collected for estimation of serum copper, haemoglobin level and ESR in the subjects. Results: Mean serum copper level in the case group was found to be significantly higher than that of the control group (p-value 0.001). This increase of copper level was more in active disease than those with remission (p-value 0.0001). A significant positive correlation was found between serum copper level and ESR, serum copper level and morning stiffness and a negative correlation was found between serum copper level and haemoglobin level in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

Design: Randomised, placebo controlled trial with three parallel groups. Setting: Five rural general practices. Participants: 194 men and women aged 45-80 years with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Intervention: Wearing a standard strength static bipolar magnetic bracelet, a weak magnetic bracelet, or a non-magnetic (dummy) bracelet for 12 weeks. Main outcome measures: Change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis lower limb pain scale (WOMAC A) after 12 weeks, with the primary comparison between the standard and dummy groups. Secondary outcomes included changes in WOMAC B and C scales and a visual analogue scale for pain. Results: Mean pain scores were reduced more in the standard magnet group than in the dummy group (mean difference 1.3 points, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 2.55). Self reported blinding status did not affect the results. The scores for secondary outcome measures were consistent with the WOMAC A scores.

Diagnosis of athlete's foot rests on clinical suspicion and laboratory testing. Treatment may consist of topical antifungal agents and, for more resistant cases, oral griseofulvin.

Objectives: To consider whether sufficient evidence exists to recommend the abandonment of vehicle-controlled studies in trials of topical treatments for athlete's foot. Methods: We searched nine electronic databases and bibliographies of review articles as part of an ongoing Cochrane systematic review from 1966 to 2007. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using a vehicle control design involving participants with a mycological diagnosis of a dermatophyte infection of the skin of the foot were included. Results: Allylamines, azoles, ciclopiroxolamine, tolnaftate, butenafine and undecanoates were all more effective than vehicle controls. Evidence of the superiority of azole creams over vehicle controls was fairly consistent from 1975 onwards. Data from patients treated with allylamines have shown their superior effects relative to vehicle controls since 1991 for even short-term outcomes. Conclusions: The superiority of allylamines and azoles over vehicle in vehicle-controlled trials has been well established, and data demonstrating this fact have been available since the completion of early RCTs. These preparations are effective and safe, and investigators of RCTs evaluating topical treatments for athlete's foot need to choose potential comparators as control interventions in the light of this knowledge and to consider the ethics of withholding effective treatment from patients who seek treatment for this common foot infection.",Can fungal creams treat athlete's foot?,fungal cream athlete's foot,1.0,Can fungal creams treat athlete's foot?,0.5032151341438293

140,2021,23968275,"Background: Tinea pedis (athlete's foot) is a fungal infection that is both widespread and challenging to treat. Standard treatments consist of topical and systemic therapies of antifungal agents, such as miconazole, itraconazole, and terbinafine. The extended nature of topical therapy and the toxicity of long-term systemic therapy limit the utility of current treatments. An alternate approach relies on an understanding of bacterial-fungal interactions. Specifically, a probiotic antifungal bacterium such as Janthinobacterium lividum can counter infection; Janthinobacterium is a major constituent of the human skin microbiota. Janthinobacterium lividum has been shown to ameliorate the effects of the cutaneous fungal disease chytridiomycosis in a vertebrate species (Rana muscosa). Methods: Dual-culture plate challenge assays were performed using J. lividum and Trichophyton rubrum, the leading cause of athlete's foot. Results: In all cases, T. rubrum colonies grew significantly smaller when co-cultured with J. lividum.

In this study, the potential of ultra-small nanostructured lipid carrier (usNLC)-based topical gel of miconazole nitrate for the treatment of athlete's foot was evaluated. Nanostructure lipid carriers (NLCs) prepared by melt emulsification and sonication technique were characterized for particle size, drug entrapment, zeta potential and drug release. The optimized usNLC revealed particle size 53.79 nm, entrapment efficiency 86.77%, zeta potential -12.9 mV and polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.27. The drug release studies of usNLC showed initial fast release followed by sustained release with 91.99% drug released in 24 h. Optimized usNLCs were incorporated into carbopol-934 gel and evaluated for pH (6.8), viscosity (36,400 mPa s) and texture analysis. Antifungal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes exhibited wider zone of inhibition, 6.6 ± 1.5 mm for optimized usNLC3 gel viz-à-viz marketed gel formulation (3.7 ± 1.2 mm).

140,2021,866279,"In our view, interdigital athlete's foot usually begins with invasion of the horny layer by dermatophytes. Because of hot weather, sweating, exercise, or tight shoes, enough moisture accumulates to stimulate an overgrowth of bacteria. Large numbers of normally resident aerobic diphtheroids cause the common wet, macerated type of athlete's foot, while an overgrowth of Gram-negative organisms, such as Pseudomonas and Proteus, is responsible for the more serious cases. The dry, scaly type (dermatophytosis simplex) often alternates with the wet, macerated type (dermatophytosis complex). Flare-ups are common in summer and can be experimentally induced by occlusion of fungus-infected feet. Suppression of bacteria is essential in treating symptomatic athlete's foot. This can be accomplished by exposing the feet to air (eg, wearing sandals) to enhance evaporation of water and prevent the accumulation of excess moisture that stimulates bacterial overgrowth. Topical antibiotics are another approach, with the ideal perhaps being an agent with both broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activity. The newer imidazoles are broad-spectrum compounds but have limited activity against Gram-negative organisms. Our agent of choice, aluminum chloride, combines broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity with chemical drying, a two-pronged attack. We view drying as the decisive element. We doubt that any local treatment can permanently eradicate athlete's foot. Potent antifungal agents can virtually exterminate interdigital dermatophytes, but the inevitable presence of infection in the nails or on the soles assures reinfection. In shoe-wearing populations living in temperate climates, interdigital athlete's foot is mainly a seasonal disease.

141,2021,25255817,"Striae gravidarum (SG), or stretch marks developing during pregnancy, affect up to 90% of women. While not medically dangerous, SG can be disfiguring, causing emotional and psychological distress. However, studies specifically addressing the prevention of SG, especially during pregnancy, are sparse. Furthermore, the molecular pathogenesis of SG is unclear and may differ from that of striae from other causes. Considering these factors, we review topical modalities that have been used specifically for preventing SG during pregnancy. We identify two major strategies (end points) addressed by these modalities, namely (i) preventing the de novo development of SG and (ii) reducing the severity of SG that have recently developed. We also identify risk factors for the development of SG and suggest that pregnant women with these risk factors are an appropriate target population for prevention. In reviewing the literature, we find that there is limited evidence that centella, and possibly massage with bitter almond oil, may prevent SG and/or reduce their severity. There is weak evidence that hyaluronic acid prevents SG. Tretinoin holds promise for reducing the severity of new-onset SG, but its use is limited by its pregnancy category. Finally, cocoa butter and olive oil are not effective for preventing SG or reducing the severity of lesions. We conclude that reliable methods for preventing SG are scarce. Furthermore, available topical modalities generally lack strong evidence from rigorous, well-designed, randomized controlled trials with ample numbers of subjects.

A variety of products are available and promoted as ways to prevent or reduce their development, but it is not clear what products are used most commonly. The objective of this study was to identify topical products used during pregnancy to prevent or reduce the development of striae gravidarum. We also explored issues around application of the product, cost incurred and influences on women's decisions to use a product. Methods: In this cross sectional, descriptive survey we collected data from 773 women, via a paper (n = 707) or online (n = 66) questionnaire. Due to missing data in the online survey, 753 women at 36 weeks gestation or more were included in the analyses. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were undertaken. Results: Most respondents (n = 589, 78.2 %) indicated that they used a product to prevent or reduce the development of stretch marks during their current pregnancy. A large range of products were used and more than one third of women (n = 210, 36.5 %) had used two or more products. Bio-oil was the most frequently used product (n = 351, 60.9 %) and it was also the most frequently used product among women who used only one product (n = 189, 32.8 %).

141,2021,26486318,"Striae distensae (SD) are common dermal lesions, with significant physical and psychological impact. Many therapeutic modalities are available but none can completely eradicate SD. The most common therapy is the application of topicals used both therapeutically and prophylactically. Even though there are many commercially available topical products, not all have sufficient level of evidence to support their continued use in SD. The aim here was to assess the evidence for the use of topicals in SD and to propose a structured approach in managing SD. A systematic search of published literature and manufacturer website information for topicals in SD was carried out. The results showed that there are few studies (n = 11) which investigate the efficacy of topicals in management of SD. Trofolastin and Alphastria creams demonstrated level-2 evidence of positive results for their prophylactic use in SD. Additionally, tretinoin used therapeutically showed varying results whilst cocoa butter and olive oil did not demonstrate any effect. Overall, there is a distinct lack of evidence for each topical formulation. The majority of topicals failed to mention their effect on early vs. later stages of SD (striae rubrae compared to striae albae) and their role in both prevention and treatment. In conclusion, there is no topical formulation, which is shown to be most effective in eradicating or improving SD.

Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2011) and reference lists of retrieved reports. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing topical preparations (with active ingredients) with other topical preparations (with active ingredients), with a placebo (that is, preparations without active ingredients) or with no treatment for the prevention of stretch marks in pregnant women. Data collection and analysis: Three review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and trial quality, and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. The primary outcome was the presence of stretch marks and the secondary outcome was the severity of stretch marks. Main results: We included six trials involving 800 women. Of the six trials, we judged the risk of bias for three as 'low risk' for random sequence generation, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, completeness of outcome data and selective reporting.There was no statistically significant average difference in the development of stretch marks in women who received topical preparations with active ingredients compared to women who received a placebo or no treatment (average risk ratio (RR) 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.03; five trials, 474 women; random-effects model, Tau² = 0.09, I² = 65%) (Analysis 1.1).Results were consistent with the main effects when we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding studies judged to be at high risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment or more than 20% missing data for a given outcome (average RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.10; four trials, 424 women; random-effects model, Tau² = 0.05, I² = 57%).The was no statistically significant average mean difference in the severity of stretch marks (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.31; 95% CI -1.06 to 0.44; two trials, 255 women; Tau² = 0.26, I² = 87%).There was no statistically significant difference in the development of stretch marks in women who received topical preparations with active ingredients compared to women who received other topical preparations with active ingredients (average RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.60; two trials, 305 women; Tau² = 0.53, I² = 74%). There was no statistically significant difference in the severity of stretch marks (mean difference (MD) -0.20; 95% CI -0.53 to 0.13; one trial, 206 women; heterogeneity not applicable). Authors' conclusions: We found no high-quality evidence to support the use of any of the topical preparations in the prevention of stretch marks during pregnancy. There is a clear need for robust, methodologically rigorous randomised trials involving larger sample sizes to evaluate the effects of topical preparations on the development of stretch marks in pregnancy. In addition, it is important that preparations commonly used by women to prevent and treat stretch marks are evaluated within the context of robust, methodologically rigorous and adequately powered randomised trials.",Does cocoa butter help reduce pregnancy stretch marks?,cocoa butter reduce pregnancy stretch marks,0.0,Does cocoa butter help reduce pregnancy stretch marks?,0.08405860513448715
142,2021,34066560,"In recent decades, researchers around the world have been studying intensively how micro-organisms that are present inside living organisms could affect the main processes of life, namely health and pathological conditions of mind or body. They discovered a relationship between the whole microbial colonization and the initiation and development of different medical disorders. Besides already known probiotics, novel products such as postbiotics and paraprobiotics have been developed in recent years to create new non-viable micro-organisms or bacterial-free extracts, which can provide benefits to the host with additional bioactivity to probiotics, but without the risk of side effects. The best alternatives in the use of probiotics and postbiotics to maintain the health of the intestinal microbiota and to prevent the attachment of pathogens to children and adults are highlighted and discussed as controversies and challenges. Updated knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the balance between microbiota and immune system for the introspection on the gut-lung-brain axis could reveal the latest benefits and perspectives of applied photobiomics for health. Multiple interconditioning between photobiomodulation (PBM), probiotics, and the human microbiota, their effects on the human body, and their implications for the management of viral infectious diseases is essential. Coupled complex PBM and probiotic interventions can control the microbiome, improve the activity of the immune system, and save the lives of people with immune imbalances. There is an urgent need to seek and develop innovative treatments to successfully interact with the microbiota and the human immune system in the coronavirus crisis. In the near future, photobiomics and metabolomics should be applied innovatively in the SARS-CoV-2 crisis (to study and design new therapies for COVID-19 immediately), to discover how bacteria can help us through adequate energy biostimulation to combat this pandemic, so that we can find the key to the hidden code of communication between RNA viruses, bacteria, and our body.",Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,probiotics child diarrhea caused by antibiotics ,1.0,Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,0.9296922087669373

Background: Antibiotics are frequently prescribed in children. They alter the microbial balance within the gastrointestinal tract, commonly resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics may prevent AAD via restoration of the gut microflora. Objectives: The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children. Search methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, AMED, and the Web of Science (inception to November 2014) were searched along with specialized registers including the Cochrane IBD/FBD review group, CISCOM (Centralized Information Service for Complementary Medicine), NHS Evidence, the International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements, as well as trial registries. Letters were sent to authors of included trials, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the field requesting additional information on ongoing or unpublished trials. Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were also searched. Selection criteria: Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0-18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Study selection, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment using the risk of bias instrument were conducted independently and in duplicate by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea and adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea and mean daily stool frequency) as mean difference (MD), along with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, sensitivity analyses included available case versus extreme-plausible analyses and random- versus fixed-effect models. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analysis was conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and risk of bias. We also conducted post hoc subgroup analyses by patient diagnosis, single versus multi-strain, industry sponsorship, and inpatient status. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. Main results: Overall, 23 studies (3938 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either Bacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., or Streptococcus spp., alone or in combination. Eleven studies used a single-strain probiotic, four combined two probiotic strains, three combined three probiotic strains, one combined four probiotic strains, two combined seven probiotic strains, one included ten probiotic strains, and one study included two probiotic arms that used three and two strains, respectively. The risk of bias was determined to be high or unclear in 13 studies and low in 10 studies. Available case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 22/23 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo, or no treatment control. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (163/1992) compared to 19% (364/1906) in the control group (RR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.35-0.61; I2 = 55%, 3898 participants). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate. This benefit remained statistically significant in an extreme-plausible (60% of children lost to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% lost to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea) sensitivity analysis, where the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 14% (330/2294) compared to 19% (426/2235) in the control group (RR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.54-0.89; I2 = 63%, 4529 participants). None of the 16 trials (n = 2455) that reported on adverse events documented any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Meta-analysis excluded all but an extremely small non-significant difference in adverse events between treatment and control (RD = 0.00, 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.01). The majority of adverse events were in placebo, standard care, or no treatment group. Adverse events reported in the studies include rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, vomiting, increased phlegm, chest pain, constipation, taste disturbance, and low appetite. AUTHORS׳ CONCLUSIONS: Moderate quality evidence suggests a protective effect of probiotics in preventing AAD. Our pooled estimate suggests a precise (RR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.35-0.61) probiotic effect with an NNT of 10. Among the various probiotics evaluated, Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5-40 billion colony-forming units/day may be appropriate given the modest NNT and the likelihood that adverse events are very rare. It is premature to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of other probiotic agents for pediatric AAD. Although no serious adverse events were observed among otherwise healthy children, serious adverse events have been observed in severely debilitated or immunocompromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation. Until further research has been conducted, probiotic use should be avoided in pediatric populations at risk for adverse events.

Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were hand searched. Selection criteria: Randomized, parallel, controlled (placebo, active, or no treatment) trials comparing co-administered probiotics with antibiotics for the prevention of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use in children (0 to 18 years). Data collection and analysis: Methodological quality assessment and data extraction were conducted independently by two authors (BCJ, AS). Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea, adverse events) were combined using pooled relative risks, and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea, mean daily stool frequency) as weighted mean differences, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Adverse events were summarized using risk difference. For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, a priori sensitivity analyses included per protocol versus intention to treat, random versus fixed effects, and methodological quality criterion. Subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and antibiotic agent. Main results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either Lactobacilli spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., or Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination. Six studies used a single strain probiotic agent and four combined two probiotic strains. The per protocol analysis for 9/10 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show statistically significant results favouring probiotics over active/non active controls (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.74). However, intention to treat analysis showed non-significant results overall (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.63). Five of ten trials monitored for adverse events (n = 647); none reported a serious adverse event. Authors' conclusions: Probiotics show promise for the prevention of pediatric AAD. While per protocol analysis yields treatment effect estimates that are both statistically and clinically significant, as does analysis of high quality studies, the estimate from the intention to treat analysis was not statistically significant. Future studies should involve probiotic strains and doses with the most promising evidence (e.g., Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus sporogenes, Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day). Research done to date does not permit determination of the effect of age (e.g., infant versus older children) or antibiotic duration (e.g., 5 days versus 10 days).

The risk of bias was determined to be high in 8 studies and low in 8 studies. Available case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 15/16 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a large, precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 9% compared to 18% in the control group (2874 participants; RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.72; I(2) = 56%). This benefit was not statistically significant in an extreme plausible (60% of children loss to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% loss to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea) intention to treat (ITT) sensitivity analysis. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 16% compared to 18% in the control group (3392 participants; RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.04; I(2) = 59%). An a priori available case subgroup analysis exploring heterogeneity indicated that high dose (≥5 billion CFUs/day) is more effective than low probiotic dose ( 5 billion CFUs/day), interaction P value = 0.010. For the high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% compared to 22% in the control group (1474 participants; RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.55). For the low dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% compared to 11% in the control group (1382 participants; RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.21). An extreme plausible ITT subgroup analysis was marginally significant for high dose probiotics. For the high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 17% compared to 22% in the control group (1776 participants; RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99; I(2) = 58%).

Meta-analysis excluded all but an extremely small non-significant difference in adverse events between treatment and control (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.02). Authors' conclusions: Despite heterogeneity in probiotic strain, dose, and duration, as well as in study quality, the overall evidence suggests a protective effect of probiotics in preventing AAD. Using 11 criteria to evaluate the credibility of the subgroup analysis on probiotic dose, the results indicate that the subgroup effect based on dose (≥5 billion CFU/day) was credible. Based on high-dose probiotics, the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of diarrhea is seven (NNT 7; 95% CI 6 to 10). However, a GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary endpoint (incidence of diarrhea) was low due to issues with risk of bias (due to high loss to follow-up) and imprecision (sparse data, 225 events). The benefit for high dose probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii) needs to be confirmed by a large well-designed randomized trial. More refined trials are also needed that test strain specific probiotics and evaluate the efficacy (e.g. incidence and duration of diarrhea) and safety of probiotics with limited losses to follow-up.

142,2021,16908901,"Background: Antibiotic treatment is known to disturb gastrointestinal microflora, which results in a range of clinical symptoms--most notably, diarrhea. This is especially important in children, for whom antibiotics are prescribed frequently. Although meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the ability of probiotics to prevent antibiotic-induced diarrhea in the general population, little is known about which probiotic strains and doses might be of most benefit to children. Our objective in this study was to assess the efficacy of probiotics (of any specified strain or dose) for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children and to assess adverse events associated with the use of probiotics when coadministered with antibiotics to children. Methods: A comprehensive search was performed of the major electronic databases (e.g., CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED) from their inception to January 2005. We also contacted experts and searched registries and meeting abstracts for additional relevant articles. Randomized controlled trials that compared probiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, involving pediatric subjects less than 19 years of age were included. Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria and assessed the studies for methodological quality. Data were independently extracted by 2 reviewers and analyzed via the standard Cochrane methodology. Results: Six studies were included (total n = 707 patients). The combined results, analyzed with a per-protocol method that reported on the incidence of diarrhea during antibiotic treatment, showed significant benefit for the use of probiotics over placebo (relative risk [RR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.75, Iota2 = 70.1%). In contrast, results from intention-to-treat analysis were nonsignificant overall (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.64-1.61). Subgroup analysis on 4 studies that provided at least 5 billion single-strain colony-forming units (CFUs) daily (range 5.5-40 x 10(9) Lactobacillus GG, L. sporogens or Saccharomyces boulardii) showed strong evidence with narrow CIs for the preventative effects of probiotics for antibiotic-associated diarrhea (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25-0.53, Iota2 = 3.5%). No serious adverse events were reported. Interpretation: The potential protective effects of probiotics to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children do not withstand intention-to-treat analysis. Before routine use is recommended, further studies (with limited losses of subjects to follow-up) are merited. Trials should involve those probiotic strains and doses with the most promising evidence (i.e., Lactobacillus GG, L. sporogens or S. boulardii at 5-40 x 10(9) CFUs daily).",Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,probiotics child diarrhea caused by antibiotics ,1.0,Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,0.8637897968292236

A randomized controlled trial using a repeated measures design was used. Cognitively intact persons (institutionalized and community) with a diagnosis of OA of the knee joint(s) received either HT sessions three times per week for 6 weeks (n = 12) or weekly friendly visits (FV) (n = 7). The HT sessions were delivered by a team of two nurses certified as HT practitioners and the FV was conducted by a nurse. All subjects continued to receive their standard care including the methods they had been using to relieve their joint pain. The two groups were similar regarding demographic variables, number of knees affected, co-morbidities, pain medications used and outcome variables at baseline. Two pain outcome measures (intensity and life interference) produced significant interaction effects. Two joint outcome measures (extension and extensor lag) also produced significant interaction effects. Furthermore, the HT group demonstrated significant improvements in 9 of the 12 outcome variables (75%) while no significant improvements occurred in the FV group. The HT group exhibited sustained effects (3 weeks post treatments) in three outcome variables.

143,2021,24359110,"Background: Patient-centered care ideally considers patient preferences, values and needs. However, it is unclear if policies such as wait time strategies for hip and knee replacement surgery (TJR) are patient-centred as they focus on an isolated episode of care. This paper describes the accounts of people scheduled to undergo TJR, focusing on their experience of (OA) as a chronic disease that has considerable impact on their everyday lives. Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with participants scheduled to undergo TJR who were recruited from the practices of two orthopaedic surgeons. We first used maximum variation and then theoretical sampling based on age, sex and joint replaced. 33 participants (age 38-79 years; 17 female) were included in the analysis. 20 were scheduled for hip replacement and 13 for knee replacement. A constructivist approach to grounded theory guided sampling, data collection and analysis. Results: While a specific hip or knee was the target for surgery, individuals experienced multiple-joint symptoms and comorbidities. Management of their health and daily lives was impacted by these combined experiences. Over time, they struggled to manage symptoms with varying degrees of access to and acceptance of pain medication, which was a source of constant concern. This was a multi-faceted issue with physicians reluctant to prescribe and many patients reluctant to take prescription pain medications due to their side effects. Conclusions: For patients, TJR surgery is an acute intervention in the experience of chronic disease, OA and other comorbidities. While policy has focused on wait time as patient/surgeon decision for surgery to surgery date, the patient's experience does not begin or end with surgery as they struggle to manage their pain. Our findings suggest that further work is needed to align the medical treatment of OA with the current policy emphasis on patient-centeredness.

143,2021,33972347,"Objectives: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of health-related disability. In the absence of curative non-operative therapies, treatment goals are limited to symptom relief. Data are limited on how patients and physicians prioritise available treatment options. We assessed patients' preferences for and physicians' attitudes towards intra-articular treatments including corticosteroids (IACS), an extended-release corticosteroid (TA-ER) and hyaluronic acids (IAHA). Methods: We conducted a prospective, IRB-exempt, double-blind survey of patients with and providers who treat knee OA. Respondents were required to have received or prescribed TA-ER in a non-trial setting. We evaluated patients' OA history, impact of knee OA and treatment preferences, and physicians' decision-making and prescribing experiences. Results: Of the 97 patient participants, mean age was 56 years, 70.0% were women, 75.0% had bilateral knee OA and 46.4% were diagnosed over 5 years ago. Of the 50 physician participants, 42.0% were orthopaedic surgeons, 34.0% were rheumatologists and 60.0%, on average, treat 50+ patients with knee OA per month. Treatment selection factors considered 'very important' to patients and physicians included disease severity (88.7%, 82.0%), impact on quality of life (88.7%, 72.0%), disease extent (84.5%, 54.0%) and activity level (80.4%, 64.0%). A majority (93.8%) of patients indicated moderate to severe difficulty with their knees. Fewer patients (76.3%) reported shared decision making compared with physicians (92.0%). Half (50.5%) of the patients reported that they experienced months of pain relief with TA-ER, 27.7% with IACS and 18.8% with IAHA. Physician assessments were consistent but estimated a greater duration of treatment effects than that reported by patients across all therapies. Conclusion: While knee OA has a tremendous impact on patients, there are significant unmet treatment needs.

143,2021,24932398,"A 48-year-old morbidly obese woman with a left medial meniscal tear and moderately severe degenerative joint disease (DJD) reported for 14-month follow-up visit from arthroscopic surgery. She reported a resolution of pain, swelling and an improved range of motion (ROM). The patient was first evaluated 14 months ago, and at that time was considered a strong candidate for total knee replacement due to her limited (ROM), knee pain, swelling and functional impairment. At a 3 month visit prior to her initial evaluation the patient voluntarily enrolled in a nutritional and exercise program overseen by a licensed personal trainer and kinesiologist. At her final evaluation 14 months later, it was noted that in addition to her improved knee symptoms, the patient lost 15% of her initial bodyweight and exhibited significant gains in quadriceps strength. Her clinical exam and imaging suggested an arrest of progression of her joint disease. It was decided mutually by the patient and physician that she was no longer a candidate for total knee replacement surgery. Although the association between her weight loss and her knee DJD can only be hypothesized, this case report may highlight the need to discuss weight loss as an alternative treatment modality for end stage DJD.",Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,0.9996188879013062
143,2021,19348978,"Objective: To compare physicians' treatment and referral decisions for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for standardized patients with matching paper patients. Study design and setting: Sixty-seven physicians (38 family physicians and 29 orthopedic surgeons) performed blinded assessments of two standardized patients (one man and one woman) with moderate knee osteoarthritis and otherwise identical clinical scenarios differing only in gender, and consented to including their data. Standardized patients recorded physicians' recommendations (yes/no) to refer for, or perform, TKA. Sixty physicians provided their treatment recommendations to matching paper patients. Results: Recommendation rates for both the male and the female standardized patients (67% and 32%, respectively) were lower compared with the matching paper patients (80% and 67%, respectively). Physicians were more likely to recommend TKA to a man than to a woman when presented with standardized patients (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.4-7.3; P 0.001). In contrast, patients' gender did not affect the same physicians' recommendations regarding referral for, or performing, TKA for the matching paper patients (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI=0.9-4.6; P=0.101). Conclusion: Unlike their treatment recommendations for standardized patients, the same physicians' treatment and referral decisions for paper patients were not influenced by patients' gender, suggesting that paper patients are not a sensitive method of assessing physician bias.",Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,0.9848789572715759
143,2021,23408077,"Objective: To examine accounts of medication use in participants with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from symptom onset to early postdiagnosis. Design: Qualitative study with in-depth, personal interviews. Participants: 37 women and one man, aged 30-70s, with a diagnosis of RA 12 months. Main outcome measure: Participants' experiences and feelings of medication use in early RA. Setting: British Columbia, Canada. Results: Medications were central to how people managed symptoms and disease. Two main themes were identified, showing that optimum medication use was hampered, and how this related to delayed diagnosis and effective care. The first theme, 'paradox of prediagnosis reliance on over the counter (OTC) medications', describes how people's self-management with OTC medications was 'effective'. Participants relied extensively on OTC medications for pain relief and to maintain 'normal life'. However, as this contributed to delayed medical consultation, diagnosis and effective treatment, OTC medication was also potentially detrimental to disease outcome. The second theme, 'ambivalence around prescription medications post diagnosis', describes how adherence was hindered by patient beliefs, priorities and ambivalence towards medications. Conclusions: This study highlights how people use medications in early RA and contributes to a better understanding of medication use that may transfer to other conditions. Given the drive towards active self-management in healthcare and patients' ambivalence about using strong medications, an in-depth understanding of how these combined factors impact patient experiences will help healthcare providers to support effective medication practices. The reported extensive reliance on OTC medications may speak to a care gap needing further investigation in the context of health behaviours and outcomes of patient self-management.",Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,0.3255334794521332
143,2021,28943040,"Musculo-skeletal pain treatment is inadequate in many haemophilic patients. Analgesics are used only by 36% of adult patients. FVIII/FIX intravenous infusion is mainly used to lessen pain, followed in frequency by usage of NSAIDS (primarily COX-2 inhibitors). In about 30% of patients, pain continues after infusion of F VIII/IX. In acute haemarthroses pain treatment must continue until total disappearance (checked by ultrasonography) and include haematologic treatment, short-term rest of the involved joint, cryotherapy, joint aspiration and analgesic medication (paracetamol in mild pain, metamizole for more intense pain, and in a few precise patients, soft opioids such as codeine or tramadol). In the circumstance of intolerable pain we should use morphine hydrochloride either by continual infusion or a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, determined by the age, mental condition and grade of observance of the patient. Epidural blocks utilizing bupivacaine and fentanyl may be very efficacious as well. Three main strategies to alleviate chronic musculo-skeletal pain secondary to haemophilic arthropathy (joint degeneration) exist: pharmacologic management, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and intra-articular injections. As for pharmacologic management, NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, celecoxib, robecoxib) are better than paracetamol. The advantages of tramadol or tramadol/paracetamol and non-tramadol opioids are scanty. With respect to physical medicine and rehabilitation, there is insufficient confirmation that a brace has supplementary favourable effect compared with isolated pharmacologic management. Land-based curative exercise and watery exercise have at the minimum a tiny short-run benefit. Curative ultrasound can be helpful (poor quality of evidence). The efficacy of transcutaneous electrostimulation (TENS) for pain mitigation has not been proved. Electrical stimulation treatment can procure notable ameliorations. With respect to intra-articular injections, viscosupplementation appears to be a useful method for pain alleviation in the short-run (months).

Design and setting: This was an uncontrolled, retrospective study conducted at a single US clinical orthopaedic practice. Patients: 248 patients with moderate to severe OA of the knee. Intervention: All patients received a single course of intra-articular Hyalgan® therapy during an 18-month period, and had a radiogram of the treated knee within the 6 months before treatment. Results: A total of 218 of 363 (60.1%) knees (248 patients) with moderate to severe OA were judged successfully treated over a 6-month follow-up period; only 20.3% of cases required TKR. On the basis of a multivariate analysis that correlated improvements in pain and QOL assessed by a retrospective questionnaire with baseline patient and disease characteristics, taller patients (&gt;165cm), patients with less severe OA, and patients with patellofemoral compartment involvement had the greatest improvement in pain relief and quality of life following treatment with Hyalgan®. Conclusions: Hyalgan® was effective in patients with moderate to severe OA, and may have delayed TKR in 80% of patients.

144,2021,30356835,"Background: Studies have shown music therapy can improve depression symptoms in dementia and the use of music activities show promise to have positive impacts on wellbeing. However, few studies show the influence of a music intervention led by certified nursing assistants (CNAs) trained by music therapists to address depression symptoms and wellbeing in individuals with dementia. Methods: Credentialed music therapists (1) administered 2-weeks of music therapy, (2) a 3-days training to CNAs, (3) followed by 2-weeks of music activities, singing and music-with-movement, led by CNAs for 62 nursing home residents with moderate dementia, (4) then measured depression symptoms using the Cornell Scale for Depression. We obtained video consent for 26 of the 62 residents who were video recorded receiving CNA-led music-based caregiving activities. Using the Music in Dementia Scale, over 200 h of video data was observed and raters measured changes in well-being, e.g., levels of enjoyment, mood and engagement in the residents, during the CNA facilitated music activities. Results: A repeated measures ANOVA revealed that mean depression scores differed statistically significantly between time points, p ≤ 0.001. Residents' baseline depression symptoms significantly declined following 2 weeks of music therapy, p ≤ 0.001, increased during a 2-weeks wash-out period, p = 0.389, but appeared to stabilize following the 2-weeks music activity, p = 1.00. A video analysis and paired sampled t -test demonstrated a significant improvement in wellbeing in residents who engaged in music with movement, p = 0.003. Wellbeing improved slightly, but not significantly for residents who participated in the singing intervention, p = 0.165. Conclusion: Findings suggest that music therapy can significantly decrease depression symptoms in nursing home residents with dementia. Music activities designed by music therapists and facilitated by CNAs may help sustain the reduction of depression symptoms and improve wellbeing in nursing home residents with moderate to severe dementia.",Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,Can music therapy help manage depression?,0.9689379930496216

144,2021,34375712,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of music therapy (MT) with imbedded 10 Hz binaural beats in combination with standard treatment in comparison to standard treatment alone in patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: This study was a randomized controlled trial enrolling 18 MDD adult patients aged ≥20 years old with mild to moderate levels of acute phase depression. The intervention group received MT along with standard treatment, while the control group received only standard treatment. 10-Hz binaural beats were embedded into soothing music. The participants listened to the MT via stereo headphones for 20 min at the clinic and were instructed to continue listening to the track at home at least 3 times/week. The primary outcome was depression score using patient health questionnaire depression screening (PHQ-9). The secondary outcomes were quality of life, measured by the Euro Quality of Life Five-Dimension (EQ-5D) rating, and medications adherence, measured by the medication adherence rating scale (MARS). The outcomes were measured at week 0, week 4, and week 8. Results: At baseline, the primary outcome of PHQ-9 did not differ between the MT group and the control group (13.3 ± 4.4; 13.9 ± 3.37; p-value = 0.77). After a follow-up of 4 and 8 weeks, the PHQ-9 in the MT group was lower than the control group by 1.50 (95 % confidence interval: -4.46 to 1.46). However, this difference was not significant, with p-value = 0.32. As for the secondary outcome, there were no significant differences in terms of EQ-5D and MARS. Conclusions: This study concluded that MDD patients who received 10-Hz binaural beat imbedded MT combined with standard treatment had experienced no significant differences compared with control group in terms of depression score, quality of life, and medication adherence.

Method: We reviewed the literature on recent research into music therapy and depression, reporting on the methods used and the results achieved, and we assessed the current position of music therapy for depression in the context of evidence-based scientific research. Results: A wide variety of research methods was used to investigate the effects of using music therapy as a psychotherapy. Most studies focused usually on the added value that music therapy brings to the standard form of psychiatric treatment, when administered with or without psychopharmacological support. Music therapy produced particularly significant and favourable results when used to treat patients with depression.

144,2021,25060169,"According to the first publication in 1993 by Rauscher et al. [Nature 1993;365:611], the Mozart effect implies the enhancement of reasoning skills solving spatial problems in normal subjects after listening to Mozart's piano sonata K 448. A further evaluation of this effect has raised the question whether there is a link between music-generated emotions and a higher level of cognitive abilities by mere listening. Positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging have revealed that listening to pleasurable music activates cortical and subcortical cerebral areas where emotions are processed. These neurobiological effects of music suggest that auditory stimulation evokes emotions linked to heightened arousal and result in temporarily enhanced performance in many cognitive domains. Music therapy applies this arousal in a clinical setting as it may offer benefits to patients by diverting their attention from unpleasant experiences and future interventions. It has been applied in the context of various important clinical conditions such as cardiovascular disorders, cancer pain, epilepsy, depression and dementia. Furthermore, music may modulate the immune response, among other things, evidenced by increasing the activity of natural killer cells, lymphocytes and interferon-γ, which is an interesting feature as many diseases are related to a misbalanced immune system. Many of these clinical studies, however, suffer from methodological inadequacies. Nevertheless, at present, there is moderate but not altogether convincing evidence that listening to known and liked music helps to decrease the burden of a disease and enhances the immune system by modifying stress.",Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,Can music therapy help manage depression?,0.960140585899353

144,2021,31784967,"Depression is highly prevalent and causes unnecessary human suffering and economic loss. Therefore, its treatment and prevention are of utmost importance. There are several advantages of using psychotherapy either by itself or combined with pharmacological treatment methods in the treatment of depression. First, it is well known that combining biological treatment with psychosocial methods increases the chances of recovery. Second, in some individuals, psychotherapy continues to be the only solution. Third, the use of antidepressants contains some safety risks and side effects, but psychotherapy does not. Fourth, clinically, depressive patients prefer psychotherapy to drug therapy. Use of a depression-focused psychotherapy alone is recommended as an initial treatment choice for patients with mild to moderate depression, with clinical evidence supporting the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), psychodynamic psychotherapy (PDP), and problem-solving therapy (PST) in individual and group formats. Important developments took place within the past 20 years in the psychotherapy of depression.

Methods: English language literature cited in Medline and published between 1970 and 2006 was searched using the following terms: anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, benzodiazepines, borderline personality disorder, lithium, medication, mood stabilizers, pharmacotherapy, and psychotropics. Only reports of double-blind, randomized, controlled trials were included. Results: Twenty eight double-blind, randomized, controlled trials were identified which included anticonvulsants, classical neuroleptics, the benzodiazepine alprazolam, lithium, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, the novel antipsychotic olanzapine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and omega-3 fatty acids. All but three were placebo-controlled. With the exception of alprazolam and tricyclics, the data from these trials revealed evidence of improvements, although often circumscribed and variable. The novel antipsychotic olanzapine appeared to have the most empirical support for having a favorable effect on borderline personality disorder. Conclusion: A growing body of data suggests that there are psychotropic agents which appear to be well tolerated, and which to varying degrees may be expected to ameliorate the domains of psychopathology associated with borderline personality disorder.

The aim of this study was to obtain estimates of effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids in BPD using meta-analysis, with a priori differentiation of affective, impulsive, and cognitive-perceptual symptom domains. Data sources: We performed a literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE, using terms related to BPD and omega-3 fatty acids. Publication date was not a restriction. Study selection: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared omega-3 fatty acids to placebo or any active comparator and pooled data using meta-analysis. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis, describing 4 RCTs testing effects of omega-3 fatty acids in 137 patients with BPD or BPD-related behavior. Data extraction: Using a pre-piloted data extraction form, we obtained data including intervention dose, duration, and BPD symptom scale scores, differentiating affective, impulsive, and cognitive-perceptual symptom domains. Results: Random effects meta-analysis showed an overall significant decreasing effect of omega-3 fatty acids on overall BPD symptom severity (0.54 standardized difference in means [SDM]; 95% CI = 0.91 to 0.17; Z = 2.87; P = .0041), without heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 0.00; Q = 2.63; P = .45).

145,2021,17877810,"Background: A growing number of observational and epidemiological studies have suggested that mental illness, in particular mood disorders, is associated with reduced dietary intake and/or cellular abundance of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). This has prompted researchers to test the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA in a range of different psychiatric disorders. We have critically reviewed the double blind placebo controlled clinical trials published prior to April 2007 to determine whether omega-3 PUFA are likely to be efficacious in these disorders. Results: Most trials involved a small number of participants but were largely well designed. Omega-3 PUFA were well tolerated by both children and adults with mild gastrointestinal effects being the only consistently reported adverse event. For schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder we found little evidence of a robust clinically relevant effect. In the case of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and related disorders, most trials showed at most small benefits over placebo. A limited meta-analysis of these trials suggested that benefits of omega-3 PUFA supplementation may be greater in a classroom setting than at home. Some evidence indicates that omega-3 PUFA may reduce symptoms of anxiety although the data is preliminary and inconclusive. The most convincing evidence for beneficial effects of omega-3 PUFA is to be found in mood disorders. A meta-analysis of trials involving patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder provided evidence that omega-3 PUFA supplementation reduces symptoms of depression. Furthermore, meta-regression analysis suggests that supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid may be more beneficial in mood disorders than with docosahexaenoic acid, although several confounding factors prevented a definitive conclusion being made regarding which species of omega-3 PUFA is most beneficial. The mechanisms underlying the apparent efficacy of omega-3 PUFA in mood disorders compared to schizophrenia are discussed as is a rational for the possibly greater efficacy of EPA compared to DHA. Conclusion: While it is not currently possible to recommend omega-3 PUFA as either a mono- or adjunctive-therapy in any mental illness, the available evidence is strong enough to justify continued study, especially with regard to attentional, anxiety and mood disorders.",Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,omega 3 borderline personality disorder,1.0,Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,0.8287757635116577

They modulate the mechanisms of brain cell signaling, including the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways. The aim of this review is to provide a complete and updated account of the empirical evidence of the efficacy and safety that are currently available for omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The main evidence for the effectiveness of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been obtained in mood disorders, in particular in the treatment of depressive symptoms in unipolar and bipolar depression. There is some evidence to support the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of conditions characterized by a high level of impulsivity and aggression and borderline personality disorders. In patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, small-to-modest effects of omega-3 HUFAs have been found. The most promising results have been reported by studies using high doses of EPA or the association of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. In schizophrenia, current data are not conclusive and do not allow us either to refuse or support the indication of omega-3 fatty acids. For the remaining psychiatric disturbances, including autism spectrum disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders and substance use disorder, the data are too scarce to draw any conclusion. Concerning tolerability, several studies concluded that omega-3 can be considered safe and well tolerated at doses up to 5 g/day.",Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,omega 3 borderline personality disorder,1.0,Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,0.9529690146446228
145,2021,29302857,"Background and objectives: Some evidence of efficacy has been found for omega-3 fatty acids in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). In a previous 12-week randomized trial we assessed the efficacy of the combination of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with valproic acid, in comparison with valproic acid monotherapy, in 43 BPD outpatients. Combined therapy was superior to valproic acid monotherapy (the control group) in the treatment of some BPD symptoms: impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol, outbursts of anger, and self-harm. The present study is a 24-week follow-up aimed at evaluating whether the differences in efficacy between the two subgroups were maintained after discontinuation of omega-3 fatty acids. Methods: Thirty-four patients who completed the 12-week trial entered the follow-up study. Participants were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the follow-up period using the rating scales that showed a significant difference between the groups after the 12-week trial with fatty acids supplementation: the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI) (items 'impulsivity' and 'outbursts of anger'), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Version 11 (BIS-11), and Self Harm Inventory (SHI). Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Results: At the end of the follow-up a significant difference within groups was maintained for all four variables examined, while a significant difference between groups was maintained for outbursts of anger. Concerning tolerability, no clinically significant adverse effects were registered during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Combined therapy with omega-3 fatty acids showed long-lasting effects after discontinuation in terms of anger control. Trial registration: The trial was registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) and allocated the code: ACTRN12612001150831.",Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,omega 3 borderline personality disorder,1.0,Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,0.9418579339981079
145,2021,31693423,"Introduction : The treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD) remains an open question for clinicians. There is scarce evidence available and the guidelines' conclusions diverge. Together with these factors, the complexity of BPD generates uncertainty in day-to-day practice. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of advances in BPD treatment and posit a critical opinion based on clinical evidence and practice. Areas covered : The authors review the clinical trials concerning the efficacy of the main classes of drugs in BPD: antidepressants, mood stabilizers, first-, second-, and third-generation antipsychotics, and other agents (opiate antagonists, clonidine, oxytocin, omega-3 fatty acids). They also include in this review studies on combinations of drugs and psychotherapies. Expert opinion : An individualized, tailored pharmacotherapy for BPD that targets the prominent symptom clusters can improve relevant aspects of the clinical picture. However, no medication is indicated to treat the global psychopathology of BPD. Polypharmacy should be avoided or strictly limited. To date, pharmacotherapy alone does not suffice to manage the complexity of BPD. Combining medication with psychotherapy may improve specific BPD symptom dimensions. In particular, it may help those aspects that respond slowly or not at all to monotherapy.",Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,omega 3 borderline personality disorder,1.0,Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,0.9998015761375427

At present, they represent two of the most significant paediatric health problems worldwide, particularly in industrialized nations. The aim of this narrative review is to evaluate possible therapeutic strategies to manage asthma in children with overweight/obesity. PubMed was used to search for all of the studies published from January 2008 to June 2018 using the following key words: ""asthma"" and ""overweight"" or ""obesity"" or ""obese"" and ""children"" or ""paediatric"". The literature review showed that growing evidence underlines the existence of an ""obese asthma"" phenotype characterised by difficult-to-control asthma with additional symptoms, worse control, more frequent and severe exacerbations, reduced response to inhaled corticosteroids, and lower quality of life than other phenotypes. Currently, therapeutic strategies centred on prevention are suggested and the development of resources to assist families with weight loss strategies seems useful for effective weight control and optimal asthma management.

146,2021,26929306,"Noneosinophilic airway inflammation occurs in approximately 50% of patients with asthma. It is subdivided into neutrophilic or paucigranulocytic inflammation, although the proportion of each subtype is uncertain because of variable cut-off points used to define neutrophilia. This article reviews the evidence for noneosinophilic inflammation being a target for therapy in asthma and assesses clinical trials of licensed drugs, novel small molecules and biologics agents in noneosinophilic inflammation. Current symptoms, rate of exacerbations and decline in lung function are generally less in noneosinophilic asthma than eosinophilic asthma. Noneosinophilic inflammation is associated with corticosteroid insensitivity. Neutrophil activation in the airways and systemic inflammation is reported in neutrophilic asthma. Neutrophilia in asthma may be due to corticosteroids, associated chronic pulmonary infection, altered airway microbiome or delayed neutrophil apoptosis. The cause of poorly controlled noneosinophilic asthma may differ between patients and involve several mechanism including neutrophilic inflammation, T helper 2 (Th2)-low or other subtypes of airway inflammation or corticosteroid insensitivity as well as noninflammatory pathways such as airway hyperreactivity and remodelling. Smoking cessation in asthmatic smokers and removal from exposure to some occupational agents reduces neutrophilic inflammation. Preliminary studies of 'off-label' use of licensed drugs suggest that macrolides show efficacy in nonsmokers with noneosinophilic severe asthma and statins, low-dose theophylline and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists may benefit asthmatic smokers with noneosinophilic inflammation. Novel small molecules targeting neutrophilic inflammation, such as chemokine (CXC) receptor 2 (CXCR2) antagonists reduce neutrophils, but do not improve clinical outcomes in studies to date. Inhaled phosphodiesterase (PDE)4 inhibitors, dual PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors, p38MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and PI (phosphoinositide) 3kinase inhibitors are under development and these compounds may be of benefit in noneosinophilic inflammation. The results of clinical trials of biological agents targeting mediators associated with noneosinophilic inflammation, such as interleukin (IL)-17 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α are disappointing.

146,2021,26683927,"Effects of vitamin D on acute exacerbation, lung function, and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in patients with asthma are controversial. We aim to further evaluate the roles of vitamin D supplementation in addition to asthma controllers in asthmatics. From 1946 to July 2015, we searched the PubMed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ISI Web of Science using ""Vitamin D,"" ""Vit D,"" or ""VitD"" and ""asthma,"" and manually reviewed the references listed in the identified articles. Randomized controlled trials which reported rate of asthma exacerbations and adverse events, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1, % of predicted value), FeNO, asthma control test (ACT), and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were eligible. We conducted the heterogeneities test and sensitivity analysis of the enrolled studies, and random-effects or fixed-effects model was applied to calculate risk ratio (RR) and mean difference for dichotomous and continuous data, respectively. Cochrane systematic review software Review Manager (RevMan) was used to test the hypothesis by Mann-Whitney U test, which were displayed in Forest plots. Seven trials with a total of 903 patients with asthma were pooled in our final studies. Except for asthma exacerbations (I2 = 81%, χ2 = 10.28, P = 0.006), we did not find statistical heterogeneity in outcome measures. The pooled RR of asthma exacerbation was 0.66 (95% confidence interval: 0.32-1.37), but without significant difference (z = 1.12, P = 0.26), neither was in FEV1 (z = 0.30, P = 0.77), FeNO (z = 0.28, P = 0.78), or ACT (z = 0.92, P = 0.36), although serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was significantly increased (z = 6.16, P 0.001).

We aimed to clarify whether low-dose, short-term vitamin D supplementation, in addition to standard treatments, improves control of childhood asthma. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing vitamin D3 supplements (800 IU/day) with placebo for 2 months in schoolchildren with asthma. The primary outcomes were frequency and severity of asthma judging from changes in asthma control levels defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) by collaborating doctors at 2 and 6 months. Results: Japanese schoolchildren with asthma (n = 89) were randomly assigned to receive vitamin D (n = 54) or placebo (n = 35). At 2 months, GINA asthma control was significantly more improved in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.015). Childhood asthma control test (CACT) scores, a secondary outcome, were also significantly (P = 0.004) improved in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group at 2 months, and differences remained significant (P = 0.012) at 6 months. The proportion of patients with a peak expiratory flow rate 80% predicted was significantly less in the vitamin D group (8/54: 15%) than in the placebo group (12/35: 34%) at 6 months (P = 0.032).

146,2021,28680776,"Asthma, a major public health issue, is one of the most common diseases affecting millions of population globally. It is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by increased airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness. Vitamin D is of particular interest in asthma due to its immunomodulatory effects. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is found to be associated with a wide range of pulmonary diseases, including viral and bacterial respiratory infections, asthma, and cancer. Several researches have reported positive associations between vitamin D and asthma. On the other hand, others have reported contrasting effects of vitamin D on asthma. This review provides an examination of current epidemiologic and experimental evidence of a causal association between vitamin D status and asthma or asthma exacerbations, including its probable protective mechanism. Most of the evidence regarding vitamin D and asthma is reported by observational studies. Therefore, results from the experimental trials of vitamin D supplementation are important as they can provide evidence for future recommendations about the significance of vitamin D for asthma.

This study aimed to compare vitamin D status during the period of severe asthma exacerbations and investigate if vitamin D supplementation improves asthma control. Methods. A total of 47 asthmatic patients and 40 healthy subjects participated in this study. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), asthma control test (ACT) score, and % predicted peak expiratory flow rate were evaluated in the period with and without severe asthma exacerbations. After that, we provided vitamin D2 supplements to the patients with low vitamin D levels for 3 months. Results. At the period of asthma exacerbation, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency was 38.29% and 34.04%. There was no significant difference in the levels of serum 25(OH)D with and without asthma exacerbations but the levels were significantly higher in the healthy group. Serum 25(OH)D levels significantly correlated with ACT score. Moreover, vitamin D2 supplementation improved asthma control in uncontrolled asthma group. Conclusions. Hypovitaminosis D was common in asthmatic patients but was not the leading cause of asthma exacerbations. Serum 25(OH)D levels correlated with the ability to control asthma.

We assessed vitamin D intakes and serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels in pediatric asthma patients on moderate-to-high dose inhaled steroids and compared them to published findings of healthy children in our city. Methods . Parents and/or patients were interviewed to estimate the children's vitamin D intakes from foods and supplements (using an adapted validated food frequency questionnaire) and asthma duration and management. Vitamin D status: serum 25-hyroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) was obtained from the medical records. Results . Vitamin D intakes from food and supplements of the asthma patients ( n = 20, 742 ± 185 IU/day) were significantly higher compared to healthy Canadian children ( n = 1442, 229 ± 121 IU/day). Despite higher vitamin D intakes, the children had nonsignificantly lower serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels compared to the comparison group.

147,2021,21792544,"Adverse reactions to foods are extremely common, and generally they are attributed to allergy. However, clinical manifestations of various degrees of severity related to ingestion of foods can arise as a result of a number of disorders, only some of which can be defined as allergic, implying an immune mechanism. Recent epidemiological data in North America showed that the prevalence of food allergy in children has increased. The most common food allergens in the United States include egg, milk, peanut, tree nuts, wheat, crustacean shellfish, and soy. This review examines the various forms of food intolerances (immunoglobulin E [IgE] and non-IgE mediated), including celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Immune mediated reactions can be either IgE mediated or non-IgE mediated. Among the first group, Immediate GI hypersensitivity and oral allergy syndrome are the best described. Often, but not always, IgE-mediated food allergies are entities such as eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic gastroenteropathy. Non IgE-mediated immune mediated food reactions include celiac disease and gluten sensitivity, two increasingly recognized disorders.

Soy based formulas have been used to treat infants with allergy or food intolerance. However, it is unclear whether they can be advocated for the prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants without clinical evidence of allergy or food intolerance. Objectives: In infants without clinical evidence of allergy or food intolerance, to determine whether feeding them an adapted soy formula compared to human milk, cow's milk formula or a hydrolysed protein formula prevents allergy or food intolerance. Search strategy: The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used including searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 - January 2004), EMBASE (1980 - January 2004), CINAHL (1982 - December 2003) and previous reviews including cross references. Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compare the use of an adapted soy formula to human milk, an adapted cow's milk or a hydrolysed protein formula for infant feeding in the first 6 months. Only trials with &gt; 80% follow up of participants and reported in group of assignment were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Eligibility of studies for inclusion, methodological quality and data extraction were assessed independently by each reviewer. Primary outcomes included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food intolerance. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed effects model where no heterogeneity of treatment effect existed, and a random effects model when heterogeneity was found. Main results: Five eligible studies were found, all enrolling infants at high risk of allergy on the basis of a family history of allergy in a first degree relative. All studies compared use of a soy to a cow's milk formula. Two studies also included a group fed a formula containing hydrolysed protein. No eligible study enrolled infants fed human milk. No study examined the effect of early, short term soy formula feeding. Three studies were of good methodology and did not have unbalanced allergy-preventing co-interventions in the treatment groups. Comparing soy to cow's milk formula, one study with unclear allocation concealment and 19.5% losses to follow up reported a reduction in cumulative incidence of childhood allergy, asthma and allergic rhinitis. No other study reported a significant benefit for any allergy or food intolerance. Analysis found no significant difference in allergy cumulative incidence in infancy (one study: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.69, 1.49) or childhood (3 studies: typical RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37, 1.44) and no significant difference in cumulative incidence or period prevalence of any specific allergy or food intolerance in infancy or childhood.

Key recommendations for healthcare bodies in Europe and the United States include: • Allergy prevention in at-risk infants (parent or sibling with allergy): Currently, there is a consensus of healthcare organizations around the world that the recommended exclusive breastfeeding duration is the first 6 months of life for the overall health benefit of the baby. Allergy prevention in non-breastfed infants at risk: There are studies showing that fully hydrolyzed formula can reduce the risk of allergic reactions, especially atopic dermatitis, in high-risk non-breastfed babies. Some recommendations for high-risk non-breastfed infants support feeding up to 4 to 6 months with hydrolyzed formulas. Further research is needed on this subject. Soy formulas failed to prevent allergy in high-risk infants. • In case of cow's milk allergy symptoms in breastfed babies: Although a small amount of food allergens may be present in the milk, mothers should be encouraged to continue breastfeeding while avoiding consumption of cow's milk and products. • In case of cow's milk allergy symptoms in non-breastfed babies: Under six months of age, extensively hydrolyzed formula is suitable for most cases of cow's milk allergy, except for severe clinical conditions, which require amino acid formulas. Over six months, soy formulas can be considered. Exposure to solid foods: The current recommendations are to start on solids at the age of 4-6 months and there is no recommendation for avoiding known allergens, despite family history. Later introduction of peanut, fish or egg does not prevent, and may even increase, the risk of developing food allergy.

A prospective study following children from birth through 15 years of age in a private pediatric practice was designed to determine if the food ingested during the first months of life is related to the development of atopy in the offspring of allergic families. Each of 328 children with a positive family history of allergy was assigned to one of three groups according to the feeding preference of the parents: 48 were fed breast milk; 79 soy-based formula; and 201, cow's milk formula. All groups had egg, citrus, tomato, and wheat restrictions as well as inhalant allergen avoidance. These were compared to a control group of 580 children with no family history of allergy. Breast fed infants were found to have approximately one-half the incidence of atopy of cow's milk or soy formula fed infants from atopic families when followed for up to 15 years. Soy feeding produced no advantage over cow's milk in the prophylaxis of allergic disease. There was a three-fold increase in clinically apparent atopic disease in offspring of allergic families when compared to controls but only a two-fold increase if the infant was breast fed.

I often consider whether nonpharmacologic interventions could prevent or mitigate the development of AD. Do breastfeeding or changes to the maternal diet help prevent the development of childhood AD? Answer: The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that lactating mothers with infants at high risk of developing AD should avoid peanuts and tree nuts, and should consider eliminating eggs, cow's milk, and fish from their diets. The World Health Organization also recommends breastfeeding infants up to 2 years of age. Studies have shown that breastfeeding can have a protective effect for AD in children; however, other studies have found insignificant or reversal effects.

147,2021,6396283,"Childhood allergic disease is common and is becoming more so. The relationship between such disease and infant feeding and early exposure to food antigens is reviewed. The studies appearing to confirm and refute the theory that breast feeding prevents allergic disease are critically surveyed and it is concluded that the best studies strongly support the view that breast feeding is beneficial. The notion that feeding a soya formula is protective is reviewed and little evidence is found to uphold this claim. Caution is urged concerning the feeding of goat's milk to infants as it has not been shown to prevent allergy, is nutritionally inadequate, and potentially hazardous. The evidence that food antigens cross the placenta and enter breast milk and can then sensitize the baby is analysed and the studies concerning the role of weaning diet in the development of allergic disease are reviewed. It is concluded that, especially for the genetically-at-risk infant, prolonged breast feeding and selective weaning does decrease the risk of allergic disease, whereas feeding a soya formula does not, and that it is not yet known if maternal exclusion of certain foods in pregnancy and lactation is beneficial.",Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,baby soy formula prevent allergies,0.0,Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,0.41224029660224915
147,2021,22237876,"For many years, the prevailing maxim for prevention of food allergy in at-risk infants was to reduce allergic sensitization by avoiding exposure to highly allergenic foods until the baby's immune and digestive systems were sufficiently developed to cope with the allergen. Current thinking is completely different: exposure to food in the early stages of development may be the way to induce tolerance. Exclusive breastfeeding until 4-6 months, followed by introduction of complementary foods individually, is recommended. Any restrictions on mother's diet, other than avoidance of her own allergens during pregnancy and breastfeeding, are contraindicated. If a baby at high risk for allergy (defined as having 1 first-degree relative with diagnosed allergy) cannot be exclusively breastfed to 4-6 months of age, the preferred method of feeding for the prevention of atopic disease is an extensively hydrolyzed formula. There appears to be no value in delaying the introduction of any food beyond 6 months of age. Most food allergy is outgrown in childhood, but allergy to some foods tends to persist. Induction of tolerance to foods to which a child is allergic may be achieved by low-dose exposure in a process known as specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI). Early results indicate that some probiotic strains of bacteria, such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or Lactobacillus F19, may reduce allergic sensitization.",Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,baby soy formula prevent allergies,0.0,Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,0.7010046243667603

148,2021,15311218,"Context: Chitosan, a deacetylated chitin, is a widely available dietary supplement purported to decrease body weight and serum lipids through gastrointestinal fat binding. Although evaluated in a number of trials, its efficacy remains in dispute. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of chitosan for weight loss in overweight and obese adults. Design and setting: A 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted at the University of Auckland between November 2001 and December 2002. Participants: A total of 250 participants (82% women; mean (s.d.) body mass index, 35.5 (5.1) kg/m(2); mean age, 48 (12) y) Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 3 g chitosan/day (n=125) or placebo (n=125). All participants received standardised dietary and lifestyle advice for weight loss. Adherence was monitored by capsule counts. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was change in body weight. Secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage, blood pressure, serum lipids, plasma glucose, fat-soluble vitamins, faecal fat, and health-related quality of life. Results: In an intention-to-treat analysis with the last observation carried forward, the chitosan group lost more body weight than the placebo group (mean (s.e.), -0.4 (0.2) kg (0.4% loss) vs +0.2 (0.2) kg (0.2% gain), P=0.03) during the 24-week intervention, but effects were small. Similar small changes occurred in circulating total and LDL cholesterol, and glucose (P 0.01). There were no significant differences between groups for any of the other measured outcomes.

Objectives: To analyze the effects of chitosan supplementation on obesity-related cardiometabolic markers and appetite-related hormones in adolescents with overweight or obesity. Methods and analysis: A randomized clinical trial was performed on 64 adolescents with overweight and obesity, who were randomly allocated to receive chitosan supplementation (n = 32) or placebo as control (n = 32) for 12 weeks. Anthropometric measures, lipid and glycemic profiles, and appetite-related hormones were examined. Results: Sixty-one participants completed study (chitosan = 31, placebo = 30). Chitosan supplementation significantly improved anthropometric indicators of obesity (body weight: - 3.58 ± 2.17 kg, waist circumference: - 5.00 ± 3.11 cm, and body mass index: - 1.61 ± 0.99 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and - 0.28 ± 0.19 Z-score), lipid (triglycerides: - 5.67 ± 9.24, total cholesterol: - 14.12 ± 13.34, LDL-C: - 7.18 ± 10.16, and HDL-C: 1.83 ± 4.64 mg/dL) and glycemic markers (insulin: - 5.51 ± 7.52 μIU/mL, fasting blood glucose: - 5.77 ± 6.93 mg/dL, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance: - 0.24 ± 0.44), and appetite-related hormones (adiponectin: 1.69 ± 2.13 ng/dL, leptin - 19.40 ± 16.89, and neuropeptide Y: - 41.96 ± 79.34 ng/dL).

148,2021,10369493,"Background: Overweight and obesity is a prevalent and costly threat to public health. Compelling evidence links overweight and obesity with serious disorders such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Dietary regimen are notoriously burdened with poor compliance. Chitosan is promoted in the US and other countries as an oral remedy to reduce fat absorption and has now been incorporated as a major constituent into several over-the-counter remedies. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the clinical effectiveness of oral chitosan for body weight reduction. Methods: Thirty-four overweight volunteers were included in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Subjects were assigned to receive either four capsules of chitosan or indistinguishable placebo twice daily for 28 consecutive days. Measurements were taken at baseline, after 14 and 28d of treatment. Subjects maintained their normal diet and documented the type and amount of food consumed. Adverse effects were assessed and compliance monitored. Results: Data from 30 subjects were entered into an intention-to-treat analysis. After four weeks of treatment, body mass index, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, vitamin A, D, E and beta-carotene were not significantly different in subjects receiving chitosan compared to those receiving placebo. Vitamin K was significantly increased after four weeks in the chitosan group compared with placebo (P 0.05). Compliance was 91.5% and 96.0% for chitosan and placebo groups respectively. Conclusion: The above data suggest that chitosan in the administered dosage, without dietary alterations, does not reduce body weight in overweight subjects.

148,2021,26747458,"Background: Chitosan is a dietary fibre which acts by reducing fat absorption and thus used as a means for controlling weight. Weight loss clinical trial outcomes, however, have contradictory results regarding its efficacy. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a chitosan from fungal origin in treatment of excess weight in the absence of dietary restrictions. Methods: A phase IV, randomised, multicentre, single-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study was conducted by administering chitosan capsules (500 mg, five/day) and indistinguishable placebo capsules as daily supplements to 96 overweight and obese subjects for 90 days. The study participants were divided in 2:1 ratio to receive either chitosan (n = 64) or placebo (n = 32). Efficacy was assessed by measuring body weight, body composition parameters, anthropometric measurements, HbA1C level and lipid profile at day 45 and day 90. Also, short form-36 quality of life (QoL) questionnaire was assessed to evaluate improvement in life-style and dietary habits were recorded for calorie intake. Safety was assessed by evaluating safety parameters and monitoring adverse events. Results: The mean changes in body weight were -1.78 ± 1.37 kg and -3.10 ± 1.95 kg at day 45 and day 90 respectively in chitosan group which were significantly different (p 0.0001) as compared to placebo. BMI was decreased by10.91 fold compared to placebo after 90 day administration. In concert with this, there was also reduction in body composition and anthropometric parameters together with improvement in QoL score. Chitosan was also able to reduce HbA1C levels (below 6 %) in subjects who had initial higher values. The mean caloric intake shows that there was no change in dietary habits of subjects in both groups. Lipid levels were unaffected and all adverse events were mild in nature and unrelated to study treatment. Conclusion: Chitosan from fungal origin was able to reduce the mean body weight up to 3 kg during the 90 day study period. Together with this, there was also improvement in body composition, anthropometric parameters and HbA1C, reflecting overall benefits for the overweight individuals. Additionally, there was also improvement in QoL score. It was safe and well tolerated by all subjects.

Herein, we evaluated randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of chitosan consumption in adult participants on body weight and body composition through a meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA). We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases. The primary body composition indices including body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, body fat, and hip circumference were extracted. The quality of included articles was assessed according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data were pooled using the random-effects models and calculated as weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity investigated using I <sup>2</sup> statistics. TSA, subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis, meta-regression and publication bias were also evaluated. Overall, 15 eligible trials (18 treatment arms) with 1130 subjects were included. The pooled analyses revealed a significant reduction in body weight (WMD, -0.89 kg; 95% CI, -1.41 to -0.38; P = 0.0006), BMI (WMD, -0.39 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.14; P = 0.002) and body fat (WMD, -0.69%; 95% CI, -1.02 to -0.35; P = 0.0001) receiving chitosan supplementation. Subgroup analyses also showed that consuming chitosan in dose (&gt;2.4 g/d), shorter-term ( 12 weeks), studies with parallel design and studies including participants with obese or overweight had positive effects on body composition. TSA provided conclusive evidence for the benefit of chitosan supplementation.

148,2021,30545156,"Background and objectives: Erratic results have been published concerning the influence of the dietary supplement chitosan used as a complementary remedy to decrease the body weight of overweight and obese people. The published articles mention as secondary possible benefits of usage of chitosan the improvement of blood pressure and serum lipids status. We performed a meta-analysis evaluating body weight, body mass index, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure among overweight and obese patients. Materials and Methods: Searching MEDLINE, Cochrane up to December 2017 on clinical trials that have assessed the influence of chitosan used as a dietary supplement on overweight and obese patients. An additional study was identified in the References section of another meta-analysis. A total of 14 randomised control trials (RCT) were used to assess the effect on body weight, serum lipids and blood pressure. Results: The usage of chitosan as a dietary supplement up to 52 weeks seems to slightly reduce the body weight (-1.01 kg, 95% CI: -1.67 to -0.34). Considering the other parameters studied, the most significant improvement was observed in systolic and diastolic blood pressure: -2.68 mm Hg (95% CI: -4.19 to -1.18) and -2.14 mm Hg (95% CI: -4.14 to -0.14) in favour of chitosan versus a placebo. Conclusions: Based on the meta-analysis realized with 14 RCT we concluded that the usage of chitosan as a dietary supplement can lead to a slight short- and medium-term effect on weight loss and to the improvement of serum lipid profile and cardiovascular factors.",Does chitosan help lose body weight?,chitosan weight loss,0.0,Does chitosan help lose body weight?,0.9990838766098022
148,2021,26901760,"The crustacean shells-derived polysaccharide chitosan has received much attention for its anti-obesity potential. Dietary supplementation of chitosan has been linked with reductions in feed intake, suggesting a potential link between chitosan and appetite control. Hence the objective of this experiment was to investigate the appetite suppressing potential of prawn shell derived chitosan in a pig model. Pigs (70 ± 0.90 kg, 125 days of age, SD 2.0) were fed either T1) basal diet or T2) basal diet plus 1000 ppm chitosan (n = 20 gilts per group) for 63 days. The parameter categories which were assessed included performance, feeding behaviour, serum leptin concentrations and expression of genes influencing feeding behaviour in the small intestine, hypothalamus and adipose tissue. Pigs offered chitosan visited the feeder less times per day (P 0.001), had lower intake per visit (P 0.001), spent less time eating per day (P 0.001), had a lower eating rate (P 0.01) and had reduced feed intake and final body weight (P 0.001) compared to animals offered the basal diet. There was a treatment (P 0.05) and time effect (P 0.05) on serum leptin concentrations in animals offered the chitosan diet compared to animals offered the basal diet. Pigs receiving dietary chitosan had an up-regulation in gene expression of growth hormone receptor (P 0.05), Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (P 0.01), neuromedin B (P 0.05), neuropeptide Y receptor 5 (P 0.05) in hypothalamic nuclei and neuropeptide Y (P 0.05) in the jejunum.

148,2021,23342013,"Chitosan, a natural polysaccharide comprising copolymers of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine, has been shown to have anti-obesity properties. Two experiments (Exp. 1 and Exp. 2) were performed to determine the role of chitosan on dietary intake, body weight gain, and fat deposition in a pig model, as well as identifying potential mechanisms underlying the anti-obesity effect of chitosan. In Exp. 1, the nutrient digestibility experiment, 16 pigs (n = 4/treatment) were randomly allocated to one of four dietary treatments as follows: 1) basal diet; 2) basal diet plus 300 ppm chitosan; 3) basal diet plus 600 ppm chitosan; 4) basal diet plus 1200 ppm chitosan. The main observation was that crude fat digestibility was lower in the 1200 ppm chitosan group when compared with the control group (P 0.05). In Exp. 2, a total of 80 pigs (n = 20/treatment) were offered identical dietary treatments to that offered to animals in Exp. 1. Blood samples were collected on day 0, day 35 and at the end of the experiment (day 57). Animals offered diets containing 1200 ppm chitosan had a lower daily dietary intake (P 0.001) and body weight gain (P 0.001) from day 35 to 57 when compared with all the other treatment groups. Animals offered diets containing 1200 ppm chitosan had a significantly lower final body weight (P 0.01) when compared with all the other treatment groups. The decreased dietary intake observed in the 1200 ppm chitosan group was associated with increased serum leptin concentrations (P 0.001) and a decrease in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations (P 0.05).

149,2021,25622524,"Background: Early-onset hip osteoarthritis is commonly seen in people undergoing hip arthroscopy and is associated with increased pain, reduced ability to participate in physical activity, reduced quality of life and reduced range of motion and muscle strength. Despite this, the efficacy of non-surgical interventions such as exercise therapies remains unknown. The primary aim is to establish the feasibility of a phase III randomised controlled trial investigating a targeted physiotherapy intervention for people with early-onset hip osteoarthritis. The secondary aims are to determine the size of treatment effects of a physiotherapy intervention, targeted to improve hip joint range and hip-related symptoms in early-onset hip osteoarthritis following hip arthroscopy, compared to a health-education control. Methods: This protocol describes a randomised, assessor- and participant-blind, controlled clinical trial. We will include 20 participants who are (i) aged between 18 and 50 years; (ii) have undergone hip arthroscopy during the past six to 12 months; (iii) have early-onset hip osteoarthritis (defined as chondrolabral pathology) at the time of hip arthroscopy; and (iv) experience hip-related pain during activities. Primary outcome will be the feasibility of a phase III clinical trial. Secondary outcomes will be (i) perceived global change score; (ii) hip-related symptoms (measured using the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) pain subscale, activity subscale, and sport and recreation subscale); (iii) hip quality of life (measured using the HOOS quality of life subscale and International Hip Outcome tool; (iv) hip muscle strength and (v) hip range of motion. The physiotherapy intervention is semi-standardised, including joint and soft tissue mobilisation and stretching, hip and trunk muscle retraining and functional and activity-specific retraining and education. The control intervention encompasses individualised health education, with the same frequency and duration as the intervention. The trial primary end-point is the conclusion of the 12-week intervention, and follow-up measures will be collected at the 12-week post-baseline assessment.

149,2021,34693071,"Background: Accelerated rehabilitation pathway (ARP) decrease patients' hospital length of stay (LOS). A lack of evidence exists on physiotherapy management and outcome as part of ARP in South Africa (SA). Our study will aim to determine whether early mobilisation and increased frequency of physiotherapy treatments for participants after hip or knee arthroplasty surgery on post-operative day 0 (POD 0) affect outcome. Methods/design: A quantitative prospective cohort study incorporating ARP on ( n = 60) non-randomised elective hip and knee arthroplasty participants will be compared with a more conservatively managed historical control group ( n = 60). The physiotherapy protocol includes early mobilisation and exercises 1-3 h post-operatively on POD 0 and a second mobilisation and exercise session, 1-2 h later. Outcomes measures are as follows: hours for LOS, the WOMAC measured pre-operatively, 6 weeks and 3 months post-operatively, 30-day readmission for safety and cost comparison between the prospective and historical cohorts. Descriptive statistics will be undertaken. A paired t -test will be used to analyse each of the outcome measures across the time periods if data are normally distributed. Length of stay, WOMAC score and cost data will be compared between the groups, using a Mann-Whitney U test. The occurrence of adverse events will be compared between the groups using Pearson's chi-square tests. The confidence interval will be set at 95% and p = 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Discussion: Globally, ARP's are successfully implemented to manage patients presenting with hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA). Research investigating physiotherapy protocols in an ARP is lacking in the literature. Conclusion: Achieving the same-day discharge after hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries may help elective surgery backlogs and waiting lists in a more cost-effective manner.

Patients suffer from pain and functional impairment in activities of daily life which are associated with a decrease in quality of life. Conservative therapeutic interventions such as physical exercises aim at reducing pain and increasing function and health-related quality of life. However, there is only silver level evidence for efficacy of land-based physical exercise in the treatment of hip OA. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether the specific 12-week exercise regime ""Hip School"" can decrease bodily pain and improve physical function and life quality in subjects with hip osteoarthritis. Methods/design: 217 participants with hip OA, confirmed using the clinical score of the American College of Rheumatology, are recruited from the community and randomly allocated to one of the following groups: (1) exercise regime ""Hip School"", n = 70; (2) Non-intervention control group, n = 70; (3) ""Sham"" ultrasound group, n = 70; (4) Ultrasound group, n = 7. The exercise regime combines group exercises (1/week, 60-90') and home-based exercises (2/week, 30-40'). Sham ultrasound and ultrasound are given once a week, 15'. Measures are taken directly prior to (M1) and after (M2) the 12-week intervention period. Two follow-ups are conducted by phone 16 and 40 weeks after the intervention period. The primary outcome measure is the change in the subscale bodily pain of the SF36 from M1 to M2. Secondary outcomes comprise the WOMAC score, SF36, isometric strength of hip muscles, spatial-temporal and discrete measures derived from clinical gait analysis, and the length of the centre of force path in different standing tasks. An intension-to-treat analysis will be performed using multivariate statistics (group × time).

Methods: After Institutional Review Board approval, 147 patients undergoing primary unilateral THA through anterior approach were enrolled and randomized to receive either clinic or home-based PT. Surveys with Hip Disability Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (HOOS) and Short Form-12 Health Survey scores for both groups were obtained before surgery and at 6, 14, and 24 weeks after surgery. Patients had the option to transition into the other study group at their 6-week follow-up visit. Results: Of the 147 patients enrolled, final analysis included scores for 136 patients. Forty-two (63.6%) of the 66 patients randomized to the supervised formal PT group crossed over to self-directed home exercise group and 12 (17.1%) of the 70 patients randomized to the self-directed home exercise group crossed over to supervised formal PT group. There were no significant (P &gt; .05) differences between groups at all time points for the overall HOOS and Short Form-12 Health Survey. Subjects with worse preoperative pain scores (P = .005) and higher HOOS preoperative activity of daily living scores (P = .015) were more likely to transition from the home exercise group to formal PT group. Conclusion: There were no significant outcome score differences between subjects undergoing supervised formal PT and self-directed home exercises. However, patients reporting worse preoperative pain and higher preoperative activity levels may prefer supervised formal PT compared to self-directed home exercises after undergoing primary anterior THA.",Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,1.0,Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,0.9529444575309753
149,2021,15140778,"Background: Diary recording of pain and disabling activities in osteoarthritis (OA) is widely recommended, but, to our knowledge, its impact on symptoms has not been investigated. Exercise programmes have been shown to be effective when patients are closely supervised by nurses or physiotherapists; however, data are lacking on the efficacy of an unsupervised home based exercise regimen in patients with OA. Objectives: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of patient administered assessment tools and an unsupervised home based exercise programme alone or in combination in patients with OA. Methods: The study was a 24 week, open cluster randomised controlled trial with a factorial design. Rheumatologists (n = 867) were assigned to four groups according to the treatment given: standardised tools (ST; n = 220), exercises (EX; n = 213), both tools and exercises (ST+EX; n = 213), or usual care (n = 221). Each rheumatologist was to enroll four patients who met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for OA (three with knee OA, one with hip OA). ""Tools"" consisted of weekly recording of pain and disabling activities in a diary. A home based exercise programme was performed daily at least four times per week with the aid of videotape and booklet. In addition to exercise and assessment, all patients received 12.5 mg or 25 mg of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug rofecoxib once daily. Outcome variables were: pain (measured on a visual analogue scale, 0-100); Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, function subscale (0-100); and patient assessment of the quality of care (0-100). Results: Overall, 2957 patients with OA (2216 knee, 741 hip) were included. After 24 weeks, both pain and function improved in the ST, EX, ST+EX, and usual care groups (mean (SD) -17 (27), -20 (29), -15 (27), -19 (29); and -11 (19), -12 (19), -10 (19), -11 (20), respectively), without significant differences between groups. However, patients in the EX and ST+EX groups were more likely to agree that their rheumatologist had done his best to preserve their functional and physical activities. Conclusion: Although patients' assessments favoured the exercise programme, results from this study failed to demonstrate a short term symptomatic effect of the two non-pharmacological treatments (weekly recording of condition and exercise) in patients with OA concurrently receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,hip osteoarthritis at-home exercises,1.0,Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,0.23367281258106232
149,2021,30236151,"Background: Clinical practice guidelines recommend exercise as the first line of management for hip osteoarthritis, yet high-quality evidence from Cochrane reviews suggest only slight benefits for pain and physical function; and no benefit on quality of life (low-quality evidence). However, the scope of physical impairments identified in people with hip osteoarthritis may not have been adequately addressed with targeted rehabilitation options in previous randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Potential targeted options include gait retraining to address spatio-temporal impairments in walking; motor control training to address deep gluteal (gluteus minimus) dysfunction; and progressive, high-intensity resistance exercises to address atrophy of the gluteal muscles. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a targeted gluteal rehabilitation programme that incorporates gait retraining, motor control and progressive, high-intensity resistance-strength training, to address physical activity levels and self-reported physical function in people with mild to moderate disability from hip osteoarthritis. Methods: Ninety people diagnosed with mild to moderately disabling hip osteoarthritis will be recruited and randomised to receive one of two exercise programmes (sham or GHOst programme). Interventions will be 12 weeks in duration, with weekly, supervised physiotherapy sessions, and daily home exercises. Both groups will receive standardised education. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 7 weeks, 13 weeks (primary time-point) and 25 weeks. The primary outcome will be self-reported physical function measured with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Secondary outcomes include physical activity measured with a tri-axial accelerometer, physical function tests, self-reported physical activity, isometric hip-muscle strength tests, hip-related patient-reported outcome measures, pain thoughts and depressive symptoms, quality of life, global rating of change, gluteal-muscle activity (electromyography (EMG)) and gluteal-muscle size and adiposity (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). Discussion: This will be the first study to compare a targeted gluteal rehabilitation programme to a sham exercise programme. The targeted GHOst programme includes exercises designed to address gait impairments as well as gluteal-muscle atrophy and dysfunction.

149,2021,27821103,"Background: Non-arthritic hip disorders are defined as abnormalities of the articulating surfaces of the acetabulum and femur before the onset of osteoarthritis, including intra-articular structures such as the acetabular labrum and chondral surfaces. Abnormal femoroacetabular morphology is commonly seen in young men who constitute much of the UK military population. Residential multidisciplinary team (MDT) rehabilitation for patients with musculoskeletal injuries has a long tradition in the UK military, however, there are no studies presenting empirical data on the efficacy of a residential MDT approach compared with individualised conventional outpatient treatment. With no available data, the sustainability of this care pathway has been questioned. The purpose of this randomised controlled trial is to compare the effects of a residential multidisciplinary intervention, to usual outpatient care, on the clinical outcomes of young active adults undergoing treatment for non-arthritic intra-articular hip pain. Methods/design: The trial will be conducted at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Headley Court, UK. One hundred military male participants with clinical indicators of non-arthritic intra-articular hip pain will be randomly allocated to either: (1) 7-day residential multidisciplinary team intervention, n = 50; (2) 6-week physiotherapist-led outpatient intervention (conventional care), n = 50. Measurements will be taken at baseline, post-treatment (1-week MDT group; 6-weeks physiotherapy group), and 12-weeks. The primary outcome measures are the function in daily living sub-scale of the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS), the physical function subscale of the Non-arthritic Hip Score (NAHS), and VAS pain scale. Secondary outcomes include objective measures of physical capacity and general health. An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed using linear and mixed models. Discussion: This study will be the first to assess the efficacy of intensive MDT rehabilitation, versus conventional outpatient care, for the management of non-arthritic hip pain. The results from this study will add to the evidence-base and inform clinical practice for the management of intra-articular non-arthritic hip pain and femoroacetabular impingement in young active adults.

149,2021,27129849,"Background: Osteoarthritis is the most common reason for pain in older adults, and the individual and economic burden of this disease is immense. The chronic character of osteoarthritis requires a long-term therapeutic treatment. In this regard life-style interventions such as physical exercises that can be carried out by the patient himself are recommended as first line treatment. There is evidence for the short-term benefit of exercise therapy in terms of pain reduction and physical functioning. Nonetheless research agendas highlight the need for multifaceted interventions that incorporate exercise strategies into patient care. Studies should be conducted with appropriate sample sizes and should allow statements on long-term effects as well as cost-utility and safety. These open questions are under the scope of this study. Methods/design: This is a controlled study in the context of health services research. The study population consists of n = 1400 subjects with hip or knee osteoarthritis. The intervention group will be recruited from participants of a country-wide health insurance offer for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis. Potential participants for the control group (ratio 10:1 (control vs. intervention) will be filtered out from the insurance data base according to pre-defined matching criteria and asked by letter for their participation. The final statistical twins from the responders (1:1) will be determined via propensity score matching. The progressive training intervention comprises 8 supervised group sessions, supplemented by home exercises (2/week over 11 weeks). Exercises include mobilization, strengthening and training of postural control. Primary outcomes are pain and function measured with the WOMAC Index immediately after the intervention period. Among other things, health related quality of life, self-efficacy, cost utility and safety will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. Participants will be followed up 6, 12 and 24 month after baseline. Discussion: Results of this trial will document the effects of clinical as well as economic outcomes in a regular health care setting on the basis of a large sample size. As such, results of this trial might have great impact on future implementations of group- and home-based exercises in hip or knee osteoarthritis.

Methods: A total of 210 hip OA patients (89 females, 121 males) were randomized into a 12-week exercise intervention (THüKo) including group sessions (1/week) and home exercising (2/week), a placebo ultrasound group (1/week) or a control group (no treatment). HMS was measured as isometric peak torque of hip abduction, adduction, flexion, and extension. Adherence to exercise and safety aspects were monitored as additional outcomes. Results: Baseline adjusted post intervention HMS of the THüKo group were higher compared to the control group (differences of 0.11-0.27 Nm/kg, p 0.01) and to the placebo ultrasound group (differences of 0.09-0.19 Nm/kg, p 0.01). Adherence to exercise was high (about 90%). No subject had to refuse from training because of an exercise related adverse event and exercise related pain was only of intermittent nature without sustainable adverse effects. Conclusions: The Tübingen exercise therapy approach has shown to have a significant positive effect on HMS.

150,2021,32427374,"Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between ROS and antioxidants, which plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of many human diseases. There is extensive evidence highlighting the role of oxidative stress in male infertility due to elevated levels of sperm DNA fragmentation and abnormal semen parameters. The use of antioxidants is a potential therapeutic option to reduce ROS and improve semen quality. The appeal is that antioxidants can be easily obtained over the counter and are considered all-natural and therefore healthy. The hypothesis has been that by decreasing oxidative stress, antioxidants may be used for the treatment of male infertility. While initial studies of antioxidant supplementation suggested a beneficial role in the management of male subfertility, additional research has questioned the benefit of these therapies. The focus of this article is to present recent evidence assessing the viability of antioxidant therapy in the treatment of male infertility.",Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,antioxidant supplements fertility,0.0,Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,0.933072030544281
150,2021,23913583,"Background: A couple may be considered to have fertility problems if they have been trying to conceive for over a year with no success. This difficulty with conception may affect up to a quarter of all couples planning a child. The reported prevalence of subfertility has increased significantly over the past twenty years. It is estimated that for 40% to 50% of couples, subfertility may be a result of female problems, including ovulatory disorders, poor egg quality, fallopian tube damage and endometriosis. Antioxidants are thought to reduce the oxidative stress brought on by these conditions. Currently, limited evidence suggests that antioxidants improve fertility, and trials have explored this area with varied results. This review assessed the evidence for the effectiveness of different antioxidants in female subfertility. Objectives: To determine whether supplementary oral antioxidants compared with placebo, no treatment/standard treatment or another antioxidant improve fertility outcomes for subfertile women. Search methods: We searched the following databases (from inception to April 2013) with no language restrictions applied: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS and OpenSIGLE. We also searched conference abstracts and citation lists in the ISI Web of Knowledge. Ongoing trials were searched in the Trials Registers. Reference lists were checked, and a search on Google was performed. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any type, dose or combination of oral antioxidant supplement with placebo, no treatment or treatment with another antioxidant, among women attending a reproductive clinic. Trials comparing antioxidants with fertility drugs alone and trials that exclusively included fertile women attending a fertility clinic because of male partner infertility were excluded. Data collection and analysis: Three review authors independently screened 2127 titles and abstracts, and 67 of these potentially eligible trials were appraised for inclusion and quality through review of full texts and contact with authors. Three review authors were involved in data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. Review authors also collected data on adverse events as reported from the trials. Studies were pooled using fixed-effect models; however, if high heterogeneity was found, a random-effects model was used. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the dichotomous outcomes of live birth, clinical pregnancy and adverse events. Analyses were stratified by type of antioxidant, by indications for subfertility and by those women also undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection techniques (ICSIs). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed by applying GRADE criteria. Main results: A total of 28 trials involving 3548 women were included in this review. Investigators compared oral antioxidants, including combinations of antioxidants, pentoxifylline, N-acetyl-cysteine, melatonin, L-arginine, vitamin E, myo-inositol, vitamin C, vitamin D+calcium and omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids with placebo, with no treatment/standard treatment or another antioxidant.Antioxidants were not associated with an increased live birth rate compared with placebo or no treatment/standard treatment (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.26, P = 0.82, 2 RCTs, 97 women, I(2) = 75%, very low-quality evidence). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected live birth rate of 37%, the rate among women taking antioxidants would be between 10% and 83%.Antioxidants were not associated with an increased clinical pregnancy rate compared with placebo or no treatment/standard treatment (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.85, P = 0.14, 13 RCTs, 2441 women, I(2)= 55%, very low-quality evidence). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected clinical pregnancy rate of 23%, the rate among women taking antioxidants would be between 22% and 36%.Only one trial reported on live birth in the antioxidant versus antioxidant comparison, and two trials reported on clinical pregnancy in this comparison. Only subtotals were used in this analysis, and meta-analysis was not possible as each trial used a different antioxidant.Pentoxifylline was associated with an increased clinical pregnancy rate compared with placebo or no treatment (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.44, P = 0.009, 3 RCTs, 276 women, I(2) = 0%).Adverse events were reported by 14 trials in the meta-analysis and included miscarriage, multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy and gastrointestinal effects. No evidence revealed a difference in adverse effects between antioxidant groups and control groups, but these data were limited.The overall quality of evidence was 'very low' to 'low' because of poor reporting of outcomes, the number of small studies included, high risk of bias within studies and heterogeneity in the primary analysis. Authors' conclusions: The quality of the evidence in the 'antioxidant versus placebo/no treatment' and in the 'antioxidant versus antioxidant' comparisons was assessed to be 'very low'. Antioxidants were not associated with an increased live birth rate or clinical pregnancy rate. There was some evidence of an association of pentoxifylline with an increased clinical pregnancy rate; however, there were only three trials included in this comparison. Future trials may change this result. Variation in the types of antioxidants given meant that we could not assess whether one antioxidant was better than another.

150,2021,24520443,"Male factor infertility or subfertility is responsible for up to 50% of infertility cases. A considerable body of recent studies indicates that lifestyle as well as environmental and psychological factors can negatively affect male fertility, more than previously thought. These negative effects have been shown in many cases to be reversible. This review aims to provide a rationale for early clinical attention to these factors and presents a non-exhaustive evidence-based collection of primary relevant conditions and recommendations, specifically with a view to making first line diagnostics and recommendations. The presently available evidence suggests that considering the high cost, success rates, and possible side effects of assisted reproduction techniques (ART), such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), early efforts to improve male fertility appear to be an attainable and worthwhile primary goal.

150,2021,30259539,"Reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress are closely associated with various pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases, ageing and male infertility. Hence, antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, N-acetyl cysteine, L-carnitine and folic acid are regularly used in various treatment regimens to protect cells from the damage induced by free radicals. However, given their over-the-counter availability at unnaturally high concentrations and also the fact that they are commonly added to various food products, patients may run a risk of consuming excessive dosages of these compounds, which may then be toxic. The few studies that have assessed antioxidant overuse and the associated adverse effects found that large doses of dietary antioxidant supplements have varying-if any-therapeutic effects even though free radicals clearly damage cells-a phenomenon that has been termed the ""antioxidant paradox."" Furthermore, overuse of antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, N-acetyl cysteine may lead to reductive stress, which is reported to be as dangerous to cells as oxidative stress and can be the cause of diseases such as cancer or cardiomyopathy.

150,2021,32935256,"The prevalence of female infertility cases has been increasing at a frightening rate, affecting approximately 48 million women across the world. However, oxidative stress has been recognized as one of the main mediators of female infertility by causing various reproductive pathologies in females such as endometriosis, PCOS, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, and unexplained infertility. Nowadays, concerned women prefer dietary supplements with antioxidant properties over synthetic drugs as a natural way to lessen the oxidative stress and enhance their fertility. Therefore, the current review is an attempt to explore the efficacy of various natural antioxidant compounds including vitamins, carotenoids, and plant polyphenols and also of some medicinal plants in improving the fertility status of females. Our summarization of recent findings in the current article would pave the way toward the development of new possible antioxidant therapy to treat infertility in females. Natural antioxidant compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and other dietary sources, alone or in combination with other antioxidants, were found to be effective in ameliorating the oxidative stress-mediated infertility problems in both natural and assisted reproductive settings. Numerous medicinal plants showed promising results in averting the various reproductive disorders associated with female infertility, suggesting a plant-based herbal medicine to treat infertility. Although optimum levels of natural antioxidants have shown favorable results, however, their excessive intake may have adverse health impacts.

A high-fat diet and obesity, resulting from an unhealthy lifestyle, affects the structure of spermatozoa, but also the development of offspring and their health in later stages of life. In obese individuals, disorders on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis are observed, as well as elevated oestrogen levels with a simultaneous decrease in testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. Healthy dietary models clearly correlate with better sperm quality and a smaller risk of abnormalities in parameters such as sperm count, sperm concentration and motility, and lower sperm DNA fragmentation. Apart from mineral components such as zinc and selenium, the role of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidant vitamins should be emphasized, since their action will be primarily based on the minimization of oxidative stress and the inflammation process.

Antioxidant and pro-proliferative activity of CYP on human endometrial epithelial cells in vitro were investigated. Role of CYP on cell proliferation was also evaluated by examining pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bcl-2 by Western blot analysis. Chemical composition analysis indicated that CYP was mainly composed of mannose, glucose, galactose and glucuronic acid in the ratio of 0.5:1.2:0.3:0.3. In vitro, CYP exhibited a potent scavenging activity on the DPPH radical, hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical. Furthermore, CYP apparently promoted the proliferation of human endometrial epithelial cells, especially beyond the concentration of 100 μg/ml after 36 h exposure. Western blot revealed that the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was upregulated after endometrial epithelial cells were treated with CYP, while the protein level of Bax was attenuated, thus leading to the downregulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.

Inspired by the "" signatura rerum "" principle and an apparent ancient folk tradition, various indications were given, such as anti-jaundice and cholagogue, pain-relieving, and quite often mentioned-ophthalmological problems. Central and Eastern European folk medicine has always been using this herb extensively. In this region, the plant is known under many unique vernacular names, especially in Slavonic languages, associated or not with old Greek relation to ""chelidon""-the swallow. Typically for Papaveroidae subfamily, yellow-colored latex is produced in abundance and leaks intensely upon injury. Major pharmacologically relevant components, most of which were first isolated over a century ago, are isoquinoline alkaloids-berberine, chelerythrine, chelidonine, coptisine, sanguinarine. Modern pharmacology took interest in this herb but it has not ended up in gaining an officially approved and evidence-based herbal medicine status. On the contrary, the number of relevant studies and publications tended to drop. Recently, some controversial reports and sometimes insufficiently proven studies appeared, suggesting anticancer properties. Anticancer potential was in line with anecdotical knowledge spread in East European countries, however, in the absence of directly-acting cytostatic compounds, some other mechanisms might be involved. Other properties that could boost the interest in this herb are antimicrobial and antiviral activities. Being a common synanthropic weed or ruderal plant, C. majus spreads in all temperate Eurasia and acclimates well to North America. Little is known about the natural variation of bioactive metabolites, including several aforementioned isoquinoline alkaloids. In this review, we put together older and recent literature data on phytochemistry, pharmacology, and clinical studies on C. majus aiming at a critical evaluation of state-of-the-art from the viewpoint of historical and folk indications.

201,misbelief,23505430,"Amitozyn (Am) is a semi-synthetic drug produced by the alkylation of major celandine (Chelidonium majus L.) alkaloids with the organophosphorous compound N,N'N'-triethylenethiophosphoramide (ThioTEPA). We show here that the treatment of living cells with Am reversibly perturbs the microtubule cytoskeleton, provoking a dose-dependent cell arrest in the M phase. Am changed the dynamics of tubulin polymerization in vitro, promoted the appearance of aberrant mitotic phenotypes in HeLa cells and induced apoptosis by the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP, without inducing DNA breaks. Am treatment of HeLa cells induced changes in the phosphorylation of the growth suppressor pRb that coincided with maximum mitotic index. The dose-dependent and reversible anti-proliferative effect of Am was observed in several transformed cell lines. Importantly, the drug was also efficient against multidrug-resistant, paclitaxel-resistant or p53-deficient cells. Our results thus open the way to further pre-clinical evaluation of Am.",Does celandine help with cancer?,celandine help cancer,0.0,Does celandine help with cancer?,0.9998100399971008
201,misbelief,23238299,"Cancer cells often develop multidrug resistance (MDR) which is a multidimensional problem involving several mechanisms and targets. This study demonstrates that chelidonine and an alkaloid extract from Chelidonium majus, which contains protoberberine and benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids, has the ability to overcome MDR of different cancer cell lines through interaction with ABC-transporters, CYP3A4 and GST, by induction of apoptosis, and cytotoxic effects. Chelidonine and the alkaloid extract inhibited P-gp/MDR1 activity in a concentration-dependent manner in Caco-2 and CEM/ADR5000 and reversed their doxorubicin resistance. In addition, chelidonine and the alkaloid extract inhibited the activity of the drug modifying enzymes CYP3A4 and GST in a dose-dependent manner. The alkaloids induced apoptosis in MDR cells which was accompanied by an activation of caspase-3, -8,-6/9, and phosphatidyl serine (PS) exposure. cDNA arrays were applied to identify differentially expressed genes after treatment with chelidonine and the alkaloid extract. The expression analysis identified a common set of regulated genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle, and drug metabolism. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with 50 μg/ml alkaloid extract and 50 μM chelidonine for up to 48 h resulted in a significant decrease in mRNA levels of P-gp/MDR1, MRP1, BCRP, CYP3A4, GST, and hPXR and in a significant increase in caspase-3 and caspase-8 mRNA. Thus, chelidonine is a promising model compound for overcoming MDR and for enhancing cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutics, especially against leukaemia cells.

(greater celandine), in order to investigate whether it has immunopotentiating properties in cancer patients. A total of twenty-seven patients with various malignancies were treated with ""Ukrain"" given intravenously in a dose of 10 mg every three days. In all patients the cellular and humoral immune response was studied. There was an increase in both total T-cells and T-helper lymphocytes, a decrease in T-suppressor cells, and normalization of the helper/suppressor (HIS) ratio. A significant increase in erythrocyte-rosette-forming T-cells and NK cells was also demonstrated. Serum immunoglobulin levels, complement components (C3 and C4), and acute phase proteins were not significantly enhanced. Restoration of cellular immunity was accompanied by an improvement in the patients' performance status and in the clinical course of the disease. The treatment was generally well tolerated.

The specific capacity of each alkaloid to penetrate into the cells was estimated by monitoring alkaloid concentration decreases in the cell medium during incubation with murine fibroblast NIH/3T3, mouse melanoma B16F10, and human breast cancer MCF7 cell lines. Mixtures of isoquinoline alkaloids containing protopine, chelidonine, sanguinarine, allocryptopine, and stylopine were applied to cell cultures for 20 and 40 min, and the content of alkaloids in the cell media was measured by capillary electrophoresis (CE). CE separation of isoquinoline alkaloids was performed in 30 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.5). As these alkaloids have native fluorescence, they were directly detected using the commercially available UV light-emitting diode without troublesome fluorescent derivatization. The results showed a differential ability of celandine alkaloids to penetrate into the normal and cancer cell interior, which was inversely proportional to their cytotoxic activity. While the most effective transport of celandine alkaloids from the cell medium to the cell interior was observed for normal murine fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells (about 55% of total content), cytotoxicity tests demonstrated selective and profound apoptotic effects of a five-alkaloid combination in the mouse melanoma B16F10 cell line.",Does celandine help with cancer?,celandine help cancer,0.0,Does celandine help with cancer?,0.9986552000045776

Herbal medicinal products are often used for the relief of dyspeptic symptoms. Aims: : To critically assess the evidence for and against herbal medicinal products for the treatment of non-ulcer dyspepsia. Methods: Systematic searches were performed in six electronic databases and the reference lists located were checked for further relevant publications. No language restrictions were imposed. Experts in the field and manufacturers of identified herbal extracts were also contacted. All randomized clinical trials of herbal medicinal products administered as supplements to human subjects were included. Results: Seventeen randomized clinical trials were identified, nine of which involved peppermint and caraway as constituents of combination preparations. Symptoms were reduced by all treatments (60-95% of patients reported improvements in symptoms). The mechanism of any anti-dyspeptic action is difficult to define, as the causes of non-ulcer dyspepsia are unclear. There appear to be few adverse effects associated with these remedies, although, in many cases, comprehensive safety data were not available.

(Papaveraceae), were compared. Both alkaloids induced apoptosis in human acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia MT-4 cells. Apoptosis induction by CHE and SAN in these cells was accompanied by caspase-9 and -3 activation and an increase in the pro-apoptotic Bax protein. An elevation in the percentage of MT-4 cells possessing caspase-3 in active form after their treatment with CHE or SAN was in parallel to a corresponding increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells. The involvement of mitochondria in apoptosis induction by both alkaloids was supported by cytochrome C elevation in cytosol, with an accompanying decrease in cytochrome C content in the mitochondrial fraction. At the same time, two alkaloids under study differed drastically in their cell cycle phase-specific effects, since only CHE arrested MT-4 cells in G(2)/M phase. It was shown earlier, that CHE, in contrast to SAN, does not interact directly with DNA. This fact is in line with DNA damaging effects of the alkaloids detected in the COMET assay.

However, Aeromonas infections are the most common complications of post-operative leech application. Hence, prophylactic antibiotic administration is recommended before and during leech therapy. It has been confirmed that patient safety and achieving the desired therapeutic effect depend mainly on the microbiologic purity of the animals used. The aims of this study were to find a safe and practical way to eradicate symbiotic Aeromonas spp. occuring in the intestine of Hirudo verbana. Methods: Leeches were fed artificially with 1.5 mL of sterile defibrinated sheep blood supplemented with ciprofloxacin (CIP) or cefotaxime (CTX), at bacteriostatic concentrations of 0.2 mcg/mL or 1.5 mcg/mL, and bactericidal concentrations of 20 mcg/mL or 50 mcg/mL, respectively. Bacteria were isolated from the leech intestines before and after feeding at different time intervals: 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d. Results: Biochemical identification of bacterial isolates from water samples and intestines of H. verbana using the API-NE20 test showed that A. veronii biovar sobria was predominant. Bacteria belonging to the genus Aeromonas were detected in all control leeches. The results showed that optimum eradication of bacteria from leech intestines was obtained using 20 mcg/mL of CIP and 50 mcg/mL of CTX, which decreased the number of Aeromonas spp. to undetectable levels for two weeks after feeding in all treated leeches. A statistically significant reduction in the number of bacterial colonies (p 0.0001) was observed in leeches treated with bacteriostatic concentrations of CIP or CTX; no bacterial growth was found on the plates after only seven days of feeding with antibiotics. All water samples in which the leeches were kept before treatment were contaminated with Aeromonas spp., whereas these samples were negative after antibiotic feeding of animals.

Although silymarin is hepatoprotective in animal experiments and some human hepatotoxic exposures, its efficacy in ameliorating the symptoms of acute clinical hepatitis remains inconclusive. In this study, our purpose was to determine whether silymarin improves symptoms, signs and laboratory test results in patients with acute clinical hepatitis, regardless of etiology. Methods: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which participants, treating physicians and data management staff were blinded to treatment group. The study was conducted at two fever hospitals in Tanta and Banha, Egypt where patients with symptoms compatible with acute clinical hepatitis and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of normal were enrolled. The intervention consisted of three times daily ingestion of either a standard recommended dose of 140 mg of silymarin (Legalon, MADAUS GmbH, Cologne, Germany), or a vitamin placebo for four weeks with an additional four-week follow-up. The primary outcomes were symptoms and signs of acute hepatitis and results of liver function tests on days 2, 4 and 7 and weeks 2, 4, and 8. Side-effects and adverse events were ascertained by self-report. Results: From July 2003 through October 2005, 105 eligible patients were enrolled after providing informed consent. No adverse events were noted and both silymarin and placebo were well tolerated. Patients randomized to the silymarin group had quicker resolution of symptoms related to biliary retention: dark urine (p=0.013), jaundice (p=0.02) and scleral icterus (p=0.043). There was a reduction in indirect bilirubin among those assigned to silymarin (p=0.012), but other variables including direct bilirubin, ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were not significantly reduced. Conclusions: Patients receiving silymarin had earlier improvement in subjective and clinical markers of biliary excretion. Despite a modest sample size and multiple etiologies for acute clinical hepatitis, our results suggest that standard recommended doses of silymarin are safe and may be potentially effective in improving symptoms of acute clinical hepatitis despite lack of a detectable effect on biomarkers of the underlying hepatocellular inflammatory process.",Can hepatitis be cured with milk thistle?,hepatitis cured milk thistle,0.0,Can hepatitis be cured with milk thistle?,0.9438377618789673

203,misbelief,25977607,"Many new and existing cases of viral hepatitis infections are related to injection drug use. Transmission of these infections can result directly from the use of injection equipment that is contaminated with blood containing the hepatitis B or C virus or through sexual contact with an infected individual. In the latter case, drug use can indirectly contribute to hepatitis transmission through the dis-inhibited at-risk behavior, that is, unprotected sex with an infected partner. Individuals who inject drugs are at-risk for infection from different hepatitis viruses, hepatitis A, B, or C. Those with chronic hepatitis B virus infection also face additional risk should they become co-infected with hepatitis D virus. Protection from the transmission of hepatitis viruses A and B is best achieved by vaccination. For those with a history of or who currently inject drugs, the medical management of viral hepatitis infection comprising screening, testing, counseling and providing care and treatment is evolving. Components of the medical management of hepatitis infection, for persons considering, initiating, or receiving pharmacologic therapy for opioid addiction include: testing for hepatitis B and C infections; education and counseling regarding at-risk behavior and hepatitis transmission, acute and chronic hepatitis infection, liver disease and its care and treatment; vaccination against hepatitis A and B infection; and integrative primary care as part of the comprehensive treatment approach for recovery from opioid abuse and dependence. In addition, participation in a peer support group as part of integrated medical care enhances treatment outcomes. Liver disease is highly prevalent in patient populations seeking recovery from opioid addiction or who are currently receiving pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction. Pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction is not a contraindication to evaluation, care, or treatment of liver disease due to hepatitis virus infection. Successful pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction stabilizes patients and improves patient compliance to care and treatment regimens as well as promotes good patient outcomes. Implementation and integration of effective hepatitis prevention programs, care programs, and treatment regimens in concert with the pharmacological therapy of opioid addiction can reduce the public health burdens of hepatitis and injection drug use.",Can hepatitis be cured with milk thistle?,hepatitis cured milk thistle,0.0,Can hepatitis be cured with milk thistle?,0.7797300219535828
203,misbelief,24335390,"Supported by a usage history that predates written records and the perception that ""natural"" ensures safety, herbal products have increasingly been incorporated into Western health care. Consumers often self-administer these products concomitantly with conventional medications without informing their health care provider(s). Such herb-drug combinations can produce untoward effects when the herbal product perturbs the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes and/or transporters. Despite increasing recognition of these types of herb-drug interactions, a standard system for interaction prediction and evaluation is nonexistent. Consequently, the mechanisms underlying herb-drug interactions remain an understudied area of pharmacotherapy. Evaluation of herbal product interaction liability is challenging due to variability in herbal product composition, uncertainty of the causative constituents, and often scant knowledge of causative constituent pharmacokinetics. These limitations are confounded further by the varying perspectives concerning herbal product regulation. Systematic evaluation of herbal product drug interaction liability, as is routine for new drugs under development, necessitates identifying individual constituents from herbal products and characterizing the interaction potential of such constituents. Integration of this information into in silico models that estimate the pharmacokinetics of individual constituents should facilitate prospective identification of herb-drug interactions. These concepts are highlighted with the exemplar herbal products milk thistle and resveratrol. Implementation of this methodology should help provide definitive information to both consumers and clinicians about the risk of adding herbal products to conventional pharmacotherapeutic regimens.",Can hepatitis be cured with milk thistle?,hepatitis cured milk thistle,0.0,Can hepatitis be cured with milk thistle?,0.8054037094116211
203,misbelief,22024968,"The use of traditional/complementary/alternate medicines (TCAMs) in HIV/AIDS patients who reside in Southern Africa is quite common. Those who use TCAMs in addition to antiretroviral (ARV) treatment may be at risk of experiencing clinically significant pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions, particularly between the TCAMs and the protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Mechanisms of PK interactions include alterations to the normal functioning of drug efflux transporters, such as P-gp and/or CYP isoenzymes, such a CYP3A4 that mediate the absorption and elimination of drugs in the small intestine and liver. Specific mechanisms include inhibition and activation of these proteins and induction via the pregnane X receptor (PXR). Several clinical studies and case reports involving ARV-herb PK interactions have been reported. St John's Wort, Garlic and Cat's Claw exhibited potentially significant interactions, each with a PI or NNRTI. The potential for these herbs to induce PK interactions with drugs was first identified in reports of in vitro studies. Other in vitro studies have shown that several African traditional medicinal (ATM) plants and extracts may also demonstrate PK interactions with ARVs, through effects on CYP3A4, P-gp and PXR. The most complex effects were exhibited by Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Sutherlandia frutescens, Cyphostemma hildebrandtii, Acacia nilotica, Agauria salicifolia and Elaeodendron buchananii. Despite a high incidence of HIV/AIDs in the African region, only one clinical study, between efavirenz and Hypoxis hemerocallidea has been conducted. However, several issues/concerns still remain to be addressed and thus more studies on ATMs are warranted in order for more meaningful data to be generated and the true potential for such interactions to be determined.",Can hepatitis be cured with milk thistle?,hepatitis cured milk thistle,0.0,Can hepatitis be cured with milk thistle?,0.5950786471366882
204,misbelief,33631819,"Purpose: This article aims to evaluate management options for antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia and associated treatment considerations such as efficacy, tolerability, drug interactions, contraindications, and dosing regimens. Summary: Hyperprolactinemia is a common adverse effect of antipsychotics. First-line management includes reducing the dose of the offending antipsychotic, discontinuing the antipsychotic, or switching to another antipsychotic associated with a lower risk of hyperprolactinemia. However, these options are not always practical and are associated with a risk of relapse of the psychiatric illness. Other management options include adjunctive aripiprazole, dopamine agonists (cabergoline and bromocriptine), metformin, and herbal supplements. A search of Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar using key terms such as hyperprolactinemia, prolactin, antipsychotic, treatment guidelines, aripiprazole, dopamine agonist, cabergoline, bromocriptine, metformin, herbals, supplements, and medications was conducted for literature retrieval. Upon evaluation of the available literature we found the following: (1) aripiprazole is safe and effective in lowering prolactin levels within normal limits; (2) adjunctive cabergoline and bromocriptine decrease elevated prolactin levels, while cabergoline may be more effective in reducing prolactin but can also be associated with a more serious adverse effect of cardiac valvular abnormalities; (3) metformin causes a mild reduction of prolactin levels; and (4) there are limited data to support use of herbal medications (chamomile, Peony-Glycyrrhiza decoction, and shakuyaku-kanzo-to) in antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. Conclusion: There are treatments available for antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia in patients who are unable to alter their current antipsychotic regimen. However, there remains a need for additional short- and long-term studies to determine the efficacy and safety of these treatment strategies, given that patients taking antipsychotics typically require chronic, life-long treatment for their illnesses.",Does chamomile help with thrush?,chamomile help thrush,0.0,Does chamomile help with thrush?,0.9621734023094177
204,misbelief,31369988,"It is well known that chamomile is one of the oldest known medicinal herbs and has been used to treat various disorders, but it is mainly German chamomile. The effects of Roman chamomile on depression still unclear. In this study, we used chronically stressed mice to investigate whether inhalation of Roman chamomile essential oil affects depression-like behavior. We previously reported that restraint and water immersion stress produce depression-like behavior and a blunted response to the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine. Each mouse was exposed to restraint and water immersion stress for 15 days, and resistance to the effect of clomipramine was induced in a behavioral despair paradigm. In the present study, we found that cotreatment with clomipramine and inhalation of Roman chamomile attenuated depression-like behavior in a forced swim test. Next, we examined the hippocampal mRNA levels of two cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6); a neurotrophic factor, brain derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF); and nerve growth factor (NGF). TNF alpha, IL-6 and BDNF mRNA levels did not change in the hippocampus of stressed mice. However, the NGF mRNA level was significantly decreased, and this decrease was not attenuated by treatment with clomipramine or inhalation of Roman chamomile alone. We also examined whether Roman chamomile combined with clomipramine treatment affects hippocampal neurogenesis and serum corticosterone levels. Stressed mice had fewer doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, but this was significantly attenuated by Roman chamomile and clomipramine treatment. In addition, the serum corticosterone level was also significantly decreased by treatment with Roman chamomile and clomipramine. These results suggest that Roman chamomile inhalation may enhance the antidepressant effect of clomipramine by increasing hippocampal neurogenesis and modulating corticosterone levels in patients with treatment-resistant depression.",Does chamomile help with thrush?,chamomile help thrush,0.0,Does chamomile help with thrush?,0.971236526966095

204,misbelief,23926485,"Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine and metabolic disorder associated with ovulatory dysfunction. Presently, little is known about the primary factors that initiate PCOS. Chamomile flowers are used in alternative medicine for its anti-spasmolytic and anti-inflammatory effects. Antispasmodic properties of chamomile ease menstrual cramps and lessen the possibility of premature labor. This medicinal herb also stimulates menstruation. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Chamomile alcoholic-extract on the biochemical and clinical parameters in a rat model of PCOS. Materials and methods: Estrous cyclicity of 30 virgin adult cycling rats was monitored by vaginal smears obtained between 0800 and 1200 hours. After about 4 days, each rat received an i.m. injection of Estradiol Valerate (Aburaihan Co., Iran), 2 mg in 0.2 ml of corn oil, to induce PCO. Corn oil was injected to the rats in the control group. All the rats in the experimental group were evaluated for follicular cysts 60 days after the injection. Rats with PCOS were treated by multiple doses (25, 50, 75 mg/kg) of intraperitoneal injections of Chamomile alcoholic-extract for ten days. The data were statistically analyzed at a significance level of p 0.05 by ANOVA, followed by the Student Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Results: The histological and hormonal results showed that Chamomile can decrease the signs of PCOS in the ovarian tissue and help LH secretion in rats (p 0.05). Conclusion: The alcoholic-extract of dried Matricaria chamomilla L. flowers can not only induce recovery from a PCO induced state in rats, but also increase dominant follicles.

204,misbelief,34811612,"Globally, there is increasing demand for safe poultry food products free from antibiotic residues. There is thus a need to develop alternatives to antibiotics with safe nutritional feed derivatives that maximize performance, promote the intestinal immune status, enrich beneficial microbiota, promote health, and reduce the adverse effects of pathogenic infectious microorganisms. With the move away from including antibiotics in poultry diets, botanicals are among the most important alternatives to antibiotics. Some botanicals such as fennel, garlic, oregano, mint, and rosemary have been reported to increase the poultry's growth rate and/or feed to gain ratio. Botanicals' role is assumed to be mediated by improved immune responses and/or shifts in the microbial population in the intestine, with the elimination of pathogenic species. In addition, modulation of the gut microbiota resulted in various physiological and immunological responses and promoted beneficial bacterial strains that led to a healthy gut. There is thus a need to understand the relationship between poultry diets supplemented with botanicals and good health of the entire gastrointestinal tract if we intend to use these natural products to promote general health status and production. This current review provides an overview of current knowledge about certain botanicals that improve poultry productivity by modulating intestinal health and reducing the negative impacts of numerous pathogenic bacteria.

204,misbelief,35496310,"Mood disorders, also often referred to as affective disorders, are a group of psychiatric illnesses that severely impact mood and its related functions. The high medical expenditures have placed a significant financial burden on patients and their families. Aromatherapy is an alternative and complementary treatment that utilizes essential oils (EOs) or volatile oils (VOs) to achieve major therapeutic goals. In general, EOs are volatile chemicals that enter the body primarily through skin absorption and/or nasal inhalation. In addition, they can work through oral administration. Inhalation aromatherapy has shown unique advantages for treating mood disorders, especially depression, anxiety and mental disorders such as sleep disorder, which have been validated over the last decade through clinical and animal studies. Accumulating evidence has shown that EOs or VOs can bypass the blood-brain barrier to target brain tissue through the nasal-brain pathway. Subsequently, they act on the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and limbic system in the brain to improve symptoms of anxiety, depression and improve sleep quality. Here, we review the natural aromatic plants' volatiles or essential oils used commonly as adjuncts to manage mood disorders and illustrate the mechanisms of inhalation aromatherapy, and mainly summarized the application of transnasal inhalation aromatherapy in depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. We conclude that aromatherapy does not cause side-effects, which is vastly different from commonly used psychotropic drugs.

Purpose: To evaluate long-term chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.) use for prevention of GAD symptom relapse. Methods: Outpatients from primary care practices and local communities with a primary diagnosis of moderate-to-severe GAD were enrolled for this two-phase study at a large US academic medical center. During Phase 1, eligible participants received 12 weeks of open-label therapy with chamomile pharmaceutical grade extract 1500mg (500mg capsule 3 times daily). During Phase 2, treatment responders were randomized to either 26 weeks of continuation chamomile therapy or placebo in a double-blinded, placebo-substitution design. The primary outcome was time to relapse during continuation therapy, analyzed using Cox proportional hazards. Secondary outcomes included the proportion who relapsed, treatment-emergent adverse events, and vital sign changes. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier <a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01072344"" title=""See in ClinicalTrials.gov"">NCT01072344</a>. Results: Between March 1, 2010, and June 30, 2015, we enrolled 179 participants. Of those, 93 (51.9%) were responders and agreed to continue in the double-blind randomized controlled trial. A numerically greater number of placebo-switched (n=12/47; 25.5%) versus chamomile-continuation (n = 7/46; 15.2%) participants relapsed during follow-up. Mean time to relapse was 11.4 ± 8.4 weeks for chamomile and 6.3 ± 3.9 weeks for placebo. Hazard of relapse was non-significantly lower for chamomile (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.33; P = 0.16). During follow-up, chamomile participants maintained significantly lower GAD symptoms than placebo (P = 0.0032), with significant reductions in body weight (P = 0.046) and mean arterial blood pressure (P = 0.0063). Both treatments had similar low adverse event rates. Conclusions: Long-term chamomile was safe and significantly reduced moderate-to-severe GAD symptoms, but did not significantly reduce rate of relapse. Our limited sample size and lower than expected rate of placebo group relapse likely contributed to the non-significant primary outcome finding.

Medicinal plants have been a major source of therapeutic agents for alleviation and cure of diseases. Objectives: The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the antifungal activity of garlic, cinnamon, lemongrass and tulsi in powder and oil form at different concentrations on Candida albicans . Materials and methods: Powder and oil of garlic, cinnamon, lemongrass and Tulsi dissolved in inert solvent dimethyl formamide to obtain different concentration. Stock solution of different concentration was inoculated on Petri plates containing C. albicans and incubated at 30°C for 48 h. The inhibition zones were measured in millimeters using Vernier caliper. The collected data were analyzed using statistical test like mean value and one-way analysis of variance. Results: Maximum zone of inhibition for the C. albicans was 42 mm at concentrations of 50% for the oil of lemongrass; followed by cinnamon 40 mm, garlic 24 mm and tulsi 20 mm. The P value obtained 0.050, 0.040, 0.036 and 0.031 were found to be statically significant for C. albicans at 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% concentrations of the various oil preparations, respectively.

Transcriptomic analysis by microarrays of gills of fish fed the EOs diet showed an up-regulation of genes related to biogenesis, vesicular transport and exocytosis, leukocyte-mediated immunity, oxidation-reduction and overall metabolism processes. The functional network obtained indicates a tissue-specific pro-inflammatory immune response arbitrated by degranulating acidophilic granulocytes, sustained by antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses. The histochemical study of gills also showed an increase of carboxylate glycoproteins containing sialic acid in mucous and epithelial cells of fish fed the EOs diet, suggesting a mucosal defence mechanism through the modulation of mucin secretions. The outcomes of the in vivo challenge supported the transcriptomic results obtained from the nutritional trial, where a significant reduction of 78% in the abundance of S. chrysophrii total parasitation and a decrease in the prevalence of most parasitic developmental stages evaluated were observed in fish fed the EOs diet.

The concentrations of allicin and pyruvate, two predictors of antiplatelet strength, were also monitored. Oven-heating at 200 degrees C or immersing in boiling water for 3 min or less did not affect the ability of garlic to inhibit platelet aggregation (as compared to raw garlic), whereas heating for 6 min completely suppressed IVAA in uncrushed, but not in previously crushed, samples. The latter samples had reduced, yet significant, antiplatelet activity. Prolonged incubation (more than 10 min) at these temperatures completely suppressed IVAA. Microwaved garlic had no effect on platelet aggregation. However, increasing the concentration of garlic juice in the aggregation reaction had a positive IVAA dose response in crushed, but not in uncrushed, microwaved samples. The addition of raw garlic juice to microwaved uncrushed garlic restored a full complement of antiplatelet activity that was completely lost without the garlic addition. Garlic-induced IVAA was always associated with allicin and pyruvate levels. Our results suggest that (1) allicin and thiosulfinates are responsible for the IVAA response, (2) crushing garlic before moderate cooking can reduce the loss of activity, and (3) the partial loss of antithrombotic effect in crushed-cooked garlic may be compensated by increasing the amount consumed.",Does garlic help with thrush?,garlic help thrush,0.0,Does garlic help with thrush?,0.8910965919494629
205,misbelief,27159979,"Āyurveda is one of the oldest codified traditional systems of medicine on a global scale. Grounded in Indian culture it has developed a sophisticated approach to healthy nutrition and nutritional therapy for the management of diseases within the framework of its whole systems paradigm. Medical interventions have been considered to be ineffective without the support of a balanced diet. Vegetarian nutrition plays a key role in customized preventive and therapeutic Āyurvedic strategies based on an individualized approach to healthcare, while broadly labeling Āyurveda as 'vegetarian medicine' would be an exaggeration. Revolt against animal slaughter, compassion through spiritual practices, and the Āyurvedic understanding of the nutritional properties of the plant kingdom led to the dominance of vegetarianism in India. Āyurveda elaborates on 8 crucial aspects to be considered with respect to a balanced diet. This paper illuminates the complex historic embedding of the Āyurvedic nutritional approach and gives a detailed text-based explanation on why and how vegetarian nutrition can be applied in both prevention and cure of diseases from the perspective of traditional Indian medicine.",Does garlic help with thrush?,garlic help thrush,0.0,Does garlic help with thrush?,0.9993725419044495
205,misbelief,23277707,"This review article on the beneficial uses of Allium antioxidants tries to give some answers to the recent doubts raised by Singh et al. (Ind J Clin Biochem 25(3):225-243, 2010) against the claim of some researchers that Antioxidants (AOs) are miraculous molecules. Many people still believe that vitamins like A, C and E are the only true AOs that play important role in the corrections of metabolic derangements in life style diseases and hence all their faults are attributed to the failures of AOs as a class. This is quite unfair as there are many other natural AOs that do equal or even better AO action than the vitamins. Such is the case with the Allium S-alkyl sulfoxide aminoacids and their breakdown products viz, the various poly sulfides and their oxides e.g. allicin and ajoene type compounds which trap electrons mainly. It is true that antioxidant vitamins and β-carotene a precursor of Vitamin A bring about problems as prooxidant or as agents that block some metabolic pathways and gene expression. Again the argument that AOs cannot improve the level of antioxidant enzymes like SOD, catalase and glutathione Px is also not universal. Actually allium AOs can even spare the use of antioxidant vitamins in the body and enhance the action of antioxidant enzymes and supply of ATP and other nutrients to the tissues as the former are good vasodialators and promoters of membrane permeability. The use of AOs should be selective and moderate. Allium AOs satisfy the role of ideal AOs based on many of their invivo and invitro actions reported by the author and others. Their metabolits can regenerate them and recycle them for a sufficient time in the body. They have non antioxidant effects also such as antiplatelet, fibrinolytic, antiinflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiageing actions etc. Plant derived AOs may be more beneficial and better tolerated in their partially purified forms rather than in their absolutely purified forms as the accompanying principles have some protective and regulatory effects in general. This and other aspects of allium AOs are discussed in the paper.",Does garlic help with thrush?,garlic help thrush,0.0,Does garlic help with thrush?,0.8076440095901489
205,misbelief,17953527,"Leishmania mexicana is the main causal agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Yucatán peninsula in Mexico. Control of this disease is associated with a Th1-type immune response and garlic extract has been reported as a Th1 immunomodulator in BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania major. In this study, we investigated the effect of garlic extracts on L. mexicana infection in vivo and in vitro. Garlic extract reduced footpad lesions in L. mexicana-infected BALB/c mice by inducing IFN-gamma production from T cells. In vitro, garlic extract reduced macrophage infection through induction of nitric oxide (NO) production. Garlic extract may thus act on both T cells and macrophages to stimulate IFN-gamma production and NO synthesis for parasite killing. A 10- to 14-kDa fraction was identified as responsible for the in vitro effect of the whole extract and may lead to the identification of novel immunomodulating drugs and therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of leishmaniasis.",Does garlic help with thrush?,garlic help thrush,0.0,Does garlic help with thrush?,0.9986447691917419
206,misbelief,27799071,"Background: Primary immunodeficiencies include a variety of disorders that render patients more susceptible to infections. If left untreated, these infections may be fatal. Patients with primary antibody deficiencies are therefore given prophylactic immunoglobulin G replacement therapy. ColdZyme® Mouth Spray is a medical device intended to reduce the probability of catching a cold and/or can help shorten the duration of a cold, if used at an early stage of the infection, by forming a thin protective barrier on the pharyngeal mucous membrane. This is the first report of this kind in the literature. Case presentation: The parents of a 12-year-old white boy diagnosed as having common variable immunodeficiency voluntarily started to let their son use ColdZyme® Mouth Spray to reduce common cold infections if possible. Prior to using ColdZyme® Mouth Spray, he had recurrent microbial infections of his ears, sinuses, nose, bronchi, and lungs. He also frequently exhibited continuous rhinorrhea, fungal growth in his oral cavity, and gingivitis with wounds in his gums. As a consequence, his and his family's health-related quality of life was severely compromised. He commenced a twice-daily treatment (morning and evening) with ColdZyme® Mouth Spray; the weekly administration of immunoglobulin G (Hizentra®) for replacement therapy was continued throughout this period. Data were retrieved by using a daily diary about infections and symptoms. His guardians had recorded infection symptoms since he was diagnosed as having common variable immunodeficiency 10 years earlier to follow the effect of the immunoglobulin G treatment. Shortly after commencement of ColdZyme® Mouth Spray treatment, he experienced a marked improvement in symptoms and health-related quality of life. His continuous rhinorrhea disappeared, breathing through his nose was easier, oral fungal infection decreased, and wounds in his gum tissue healed for the first time in several years. Conclusions: We observed that when ColdZyme® Mouth Spray was used to reduce common cold viral infection in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency on immunoglobulin G replacement therapy, secondary microbial and fungal infections in his oral cavity and oropharynx were also reduced. A controlled study is warranted to confirm the observed results.",Does aloe help for a runny nose?,aloe help runny nose,0.0,Does aloe help for a runny nose?,0.8428947925567627
206,misbelief,19405150,"Physiological responses to acute stress proceed with the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) system. Many brain regions are known to modulate the HPA axis activation in stress responses, but the detailed neural circuits and signaling system in the upstream of the HPA axis have to be explored further. Type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5) is highly concentrated in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens, which are implicated in reward and stress-related behavior. AC5(-/-) mice exposed to daily 2-hr restraint stress for only 3-5 days showed poor stress-coping responses, including severe body weight loss, poor coat condition, respiratory difficulties, and freezing behavior. Plasma corticosterone levels during 2-hr stress sessions increased in AC5(-/-) mice compared with those of AC5(+/+) mice. However, neither the corticosterone receptor antagonist RU486 nor the CRH receptor antagonist NBI27914 blocked their poor stress coping, whereas the administration of the GABA(A) receptor allosteric modulator diazepam or the D1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH23390 prior to restraint stress sessions changed their stress-coping response to the stressed AC5(+/+) mouse level. Stress-triggered c-Fos expression was completely blunted in the dorsal striatum of AC5(-/-). These results suggest that the AC5-associated signal system and neural network are involved in the regulation of anxiety and stress-coping response.",Does aloe help for a runny nose?,aloe help runny nose,0.0,Does aloe help for a runny nose?,0.9779726266860962

206,misbelief,35107434,"Background: Health-related social media data are increasingly being used in disease surveillance studies. In particular, surveillance of infectious diseases such as influenza has demonstrated high correlations between the number of social media posts mentioning the disease and the number of patients who went to the hospital and were diagnosed with the disease. However, the prevalence of some diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, cannot be estimated based on the number of patients alone. Specifically, individuals with allergic rhinitis typically self-medicate by taking over-the-counter (OTC) medications without going to the hospital. Although allergic rhinitis is not a life-threatening disease, it represents a major social problem because it reduces people's quality of life, making it essential to understand its prevalence and people's motives for self-medication behavior. Objective: This study aims to explore the relationship between the number of social media posts mentioning the main symptoms of allergic rhinitis and the sales volume of OTC rhinitis medications in Japan. Methods: We collected tweets over 4 years (from 2017 to 2020) that included keywords corresponding to the main nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis: ""sneezing,"" ""runny nose,"" and ""stuffy nose."" We also obtained the sales volume of OTC drugs, including oral medications and nasal sprays, for the same period. We then calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between time series data on the number of tweets per week and time series data on the sales volume of OTC drugs per week. Results: The results showed a much higher correlation (r=0.8432) between the time series data on the number of tweets mentioning ""stuffy nose"" and the time series data on the sales volume of nasal sprays than for the other two symptoms. There was also a high correlation (r=0.9317) between the seasonal components of these time series data. Conclusions: We investigated the relationships between social media data and behavioral patterns, such as OTC drug sales volume. Exploring these relationships can help us understand the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and the motives for self-care treatment using social media data, which would be useful as a marketing indicator to reduce the number of out-of-stocks in stores, provide (sell) rhinitis medicines to consumers in a stable manner, and reduce the loss of sales opportunities. In the future, in-depth investigations are required to estimate sales volume using social media data, and future research could investigate other diseases and countries.",Does aloe help for a runny nose?,aloe help runny nose,0.0,Does aloe help for a runny nose?,0.885875940322876
206,misbelief,26607663,"Background: The genus Aloe is renowned for its medicinal and cosmetic properties and long history of use. Sixty-three Aloe species occur in Kenya, of which around 50 % are endemic. Several species of aloes are threatened with extinction and knowledge about their use is of major importance for sound conservation strategies. The main aims of this study were to assess the biocultural value of Aloe in Kenya by documenting local uses of aloes and evaluating how the vernacular names reflect the relative importance in different ethnic groups. Methods: Ethnobotanical and ethnotaxonomical data were collected using field observations and semi-structured interviews. Information was collected by interviewing 63 respondents from nine different ethnic groups, representing different ages, gender and occupations. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.1.2. Results: A total of 19 species of Aloe were found in the study area, of which 16 were used. On the generic level Aloe was easily distinguished. At species level, the local and scientific delimitation were almost identical for frequently used taxa. Aloe secundiflora, with 57 unique use records was the most important species. The two most frequently mentioned Aloe treatments, were malaria and poultry diseases. In our study area neither age nor gender had a significant influence on the level of knowledge of Aloe use. Finally, no correlation was found between extent of use and people's perception of decrease in local aloe populations. The aloes are highly appreciated and are therefore propagated and transported over large areas when people relocate. Conclusion: Biocultural value is reflected in the ethnotaxonomy of Aloe in Kenya. Different ethnic groups recognise their most-valued Aloe at the genus level as ""the aloe"" and add explanatory names for the other species, such as the ""spotted aloe"" and the ""one-legged aloe"". Widespread species of Aloe have the highest number of uses. There is no obvious correlation with high use and decrease in abundance of aloes locally, and we found no compelling evidence for local uses causing devastating damage to populations of the 19 species in use, whereas habitat loss and commercial harvesting appear to be of urgent concern for these important plants.",Does aloe help for a runny nose?,aloe help runny nose,0.0,Does aloe help for a runny nose?,0.4922885000705719
206,misbelief,35833241,"Objectives: Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is a diagnostic challenge due to its overlapping symptomatology with other sinonasal diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate whether items on the sinonasal outcome test (SNOT)-22 could suggest a diagnosis of spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea versus chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). Methods: A multi-institutional retrospective chart review of patients with spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea and a control group of CRSsNP patients was performed. Individual SNOT-22 scores and domain scores were compared. Results: One hundred fifteen patients were included in both cohorts. Of the patients in the CSF rhinorrhea group, 48% were misdiagnosed as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) prior to the correct identification of a CSF leak. On bivariate analysis, the CSF rhinorrhea group scored significantly higher on the SNOT-22 for runny nose ( P .001) and was more likely to designate this symptom as most important ( P .001). The CRSsNP group scored significantly higher in nasal blockage ( P .001), thick nasal discharge ( P .001), facial pain/pressure ( P .001), and in the ear/facial ( P .001) and rhinologic ( P = .003) domains. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that runny nose ( P .001) was most predictive of spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea while nasal blockage ( P .001), thick nasal discharge ( P .001), and facial pain/pressure ( P = .001) were predictive of CRSsNP after adjusting for relevant confounders. No significant difference was observed in total SNOT-22 scores between groups ( P = .676). Conclusions: Spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea is commonly misdiagnosed as other sinonasal pathologies. However, individual SNOT-22 items can help aid in suggesting a CSF leak. Spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea should be suspected in patients who have high SNOT-22 scores for runny nose and report this symptom as most important, but have lower scores related to the other cardinal symptoms of CRS.",Does aloe help for a runny nose?,aloe help runny nose,0.0,Does aloe help for a runny nose?,0.9723132252693176

The objective of our study was to investigate whether maggot extracts can modulate regulatory T cells (Tregs) and treat allergic rhinitis (AR). Methods: Mice were randomly assigned to five groups (n=6/group): normal, AR, Maggot, AR+ Maggot, and AR+ dexamethasone (DXM). The Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS), ovalbumin (OVA)-sIgE titers, histopathological characteristics and Th1-/Th2-/Th17-related cytokine levels were evaluated. The expression of T-bet, GATA3, RORγt and Foxp3 in the spleen and nasal mucosa of mice was detected, and the proportion of differentiated Tregs in the spleen of mice was determined. In addition, the effects of maggot extracts on the expression level of Foxp3 and the differentiation of Tregs in vitro were studied. Histological evaluation of the potential toxicity was also performed. Results: Compared with the AR group, the AR+ Maggot group showed reduction in histopathological inflammation, downregulated OVA-sIgE titers, and restoration of the imbalance in cytokine profiles (P 0.05). After treatment with maggot extracts, the proportions of Tregs and Foxp3 expression in the spleen were significantly increased, the expression of GATA3 and RORγt was decreased (P 0.05), and the expression of T-bet showed no significant change (P&gt;0.05). In vitro, maggot extracts promoted the expression of Foxp3 and differentiation of Tregs in a dose- and time-dependent manner (P 0.05). In addition, no obvious organ damage was observed in mice treated with maggot extracts. Conclusion: Maggot extracts can inhibit the progression of AR by upregulating the level of Foxp3 and promoting the differentiation of Tregs, thus serving as an alternate treatment for AR.",Does aloe help for a runny nose?,aloe help runny nose,0.0,Does aloe help for a runny nose?,0.9398186802864075

This study was conducted to compare the clinical and radiographic success rate of Allium sativum oil and MTA in pulpotomy of primary molar teeth. Materials and methods: This randomized, controlled, clinical trial was performed on a group of children with at least two symptom-free primary molars requiring pulpotomy. A total of 90 teeth were randomly assigned into two groups: After pulp amputation and hemostasis, Group I received MTA as medication in the pulp chamber and Group II received Allium sativum oil over the pulp stumps. Pulp chamber was then filled with reinforced ZOE paste (zinc oxide eugenol) and teeth were restored using stainless steel crowns. The follow-up scheme of 6, 12, and 18 months was set, and teeth evaluation was conducted by a calibrated pediatric dentist based on the modified criteria proposed by Zurn and Seale.

207,misbelief,28390650,"Background and overview: Inappropriate self-treatment with topically applied therapeutic or nontherapeutic agents frequently results in mucosal burns. Although such chemical burns typically are associated with misuse of analgesics, investigators also have reported them in conjunction with topical application of a variety of other agents. Case description: The authors report an unusual case of a 49-year-old man seeking care for maxillary tooth pain who had an oral mucosal burn of the maxillary vestibule caused by topical application of crushed raw garlic. The patient believed this treatment would alleviate his dental pain. Localized tissue necrosis was visible at the site of application. The authors instructed the patient to cease self-treatment with raw garlic but deemed treatment was otherwise unnecessary. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the second reported case of a garlic burn of the oral mucosa. The authors discuss the history of garlic as a naturopathic remedy, as well as the development of chemical burns associated with its topical use. The authors also review the literature on chemical burns caused by inappropriate self-treatment. Conclusions and practical implications: Dentists should consider the possibility of an oral chemical burn when a patient has a destructive or necrotic mucosal lesion located near a painful tooth. In this report, the authors highlight the importance of obtaining a detailed clinical history to establish a proper diagnosis and proper patient education to prevent future mucosal injury from inappropriate self-treatment.

This paper aims to document the current and past uses of non-plant remedies and cultivated plants in the study region for human/animal medication; to analyze the human medicinal and veterinary use areas in the context of the remedy groups; to qualitatively compare the results with relevant historical publications; and to compare the intensity and purpose of use between the remedy groups.

Currently used home-remedies as well as those used in the past were documented by employing the folk history method. The subject was approached through health-related uses, not by way of remedies. Interview records were digitalized and structured in Detailed Use Records in order to ascertain local perceptions. An Informant Consensus Factor (FIC) was calculated for remedy groups as well as for different use categories. Results: In the human medication area the use of nearby remedies was neither very diverse nor numerous: 266 DUR for 45 taxa belonging to 27 families were recorded for cultivated plants along with 188 DUR for 58 different non-plant remedies. The FIC values for both remedy groups were lower than for wild plants. In the ethnoveterinary medicine use area there were 48 DUR referring to the use of 14 cultivated plant taxa from 12 families and 72 DUR referring to the use of 31 non-plant remedies. The FIC value for the whole veterinary use area of cultivated plants was relatively low, yet similar to the FIC of wild plants. Conclusions: Differences between remedy groups were pronounced, indicating that in domestic human medicine cultivated plants and non-plant remedies are either remarkably less important than wild ones or not considered worth talking about. In ethnoveterinary medicine non-plant remedies are almost equally important as wild plants, while cultivated plants are the least used. People in study area seem to still more often rely on, or are more willing to talk to strangers about, wild plants, as promoted by both official medicine and popular literature.",Does garlic help with toothache?,garlic help toothache,0.0,Does garlic help with toothache?,0.518717885017395
207,misbelief,20658771,"Aim of the study: Plant use has been the subject of many codices, documents and books and still is the subject of many scientific articles, trivial books and brochures. These texts, both historical and recent, exert a strong influence on local plant use, a means of knowledge transmission in particular European studies neglect to consider. Therefore, we determine the causal influence of historical texts on present medicinal plant knowledge using the example of Matthioli (1568) and contemporary ethnobotanical literature from Campania. Materials and methods: We used Bayesian statistical inference and in particular the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) model to determine the causal effect of Matthioli on contemporary medicinal plant use in Campania. Results: The estimation of the average increment of finding a plant species mentioned for a certain use category caused by Matthioli is about 20%, conditionally on the available data. Matthioli's effect is not negligible and lies between 14 and 25% with a high probability. Conclusions: Studies on contemporary medicinal plant use in Europe over the last two to three decades still include the knowledge of the texts from the Renaissance and the classical writers. To what extent the remaining 80% contain autochthonous knowledge is difficult to assess. Considering the long-lasting effect of Matthioli, more recent books, brochures and newspapers very likely also exerted an influence. As well, television and radio reports on the results of pharmacological and clinical studies and, more recently, the world wide web show an ever-increasing influence.",Does garlic help with toothache?,garlic help toothache,0.0,Does garlic help with toothache?,0.864578366279602

Although there are a few studies evaluating caffeine effects on pregnancy; however, a diuretic effect of caffeine on fetal kidneys has not been reported. Therefore, after drinking coffee whether changing of amniotic fluid index (AFI) and fetal renal artery blood flow (FRABF, RI, Resistive index; PI, Pulsatility index) were evaluated in this study. Methods: This clinical study was performed with two groups. For the study group, 63 participants with isolated borderline oligohydramnios who agreed to drink one cup of instant coffee were included in this study while 63 participants with isolated borderline oligohydramnios who did not drink one cup of instant coffee formed the control group. AFI, RI and PI were evaluated both before and after coffee intake. Results: Maternal characteristics of all study population were homogenous. FRABF indices were similar in both before and after coffee consumption. AFI was increased significantly six hours after drinking coffee (p 0.001). Conclusions: The coffee consumption increased the amniotic fluid volume. However it does not seem to affect on FRABF.

Small for gestational age (SGA) is an important perinatal outcome and has been associated with long term complications. We examined the association between maternal caffeine intake and SGA using National Birth Defects Prevention Study data. Non-malformed live born infants with an estimated date of delivery from 1997-2007 (n = 7,943) were included in this analysis. Maternal caffeine exposure was examined as total caffeine intake and individual caffeinated beverage type (coffee, tea, and soda); sex-, race/ethnic-, and parity-specific growth curves were constructed to estimate SGA births. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. Interaction with caffeine exposures was assessed for maternal smoking, vasoconstrictor medication use, and folic acid. Six hundred forty-eight infants (8.2%) were found to be SGA in this analysis. Increasing aORs were observed for increasing intakes of total caffeine and for each caffeinated beverage with aORs (adjusting for maternal education, high blood pressure, and smoking) ranging from 1.3 to 2.1 for the highest intake categories (300+ mg/day total caffeine and 3+ servings/day for each beverage type). Little indication of additive interaction by maternal smoking, vasoconstrictor medication use, or folic acid intake was observed. We observed an increase in SGA births for mothers with higher caffeine intake, particularly for those consuming 300+ mg of caffeine per day.

Taking into account the results of these studies, it can be concluded that coffee has a number of health benefits in terms of the population, including the reduction of the risk of death from any cause. From a clinical point of view, the safety of coffee consumption in a specific subpopulation of pregnant women is important. A large percentage of women continue to consume this drink during pregnancy, while a significant proportion of them exceed the permissible daily dose of caffeine (≤ 200 mg). During pregnancy, the metabolism of caffeine slows down significantly, which prolongs its action and penetrates into the body of the fetus. These biochemical observations have become the driving force behind numerous clinical studies assessing the impact of coffee consumption during pregnancy on its course, complications and the health of the newborn.

Participants included 29 older adults who had experienced postprandial drops in systolic blood pressure of more than 15 mmHg in a previous study. During the experimental phase, each participant drank 400 mL of green tea before lunch; during the control phase, participants ate lunch without any tea. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured during both phases before lunch and at 15-minute intervals for 90 minutes after lunch. Drinking green tea before lunch elicited significant pressor effects by increasing systolic and diastolic blood pressure an average of 15.1 mmHg and 5.7 mmHg, respectively.

209,misbelief,24861099,"Purpose: Although previous literature has reported that regular green tea consumption may improve blood pressure, the evidence from these studies is not consistent. The present study systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials and examined the effect of green tea consumption on blood pressure using meta-analysis. Methods: Search of ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library (CENTERAL) was conducted, to identify eligible articles. Articles from 1995 to 2013 were included. A random-effect model was chosen to calculate the effect of combined trials. Result: Thirteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Green tea consumption significantly changed systolic blood pressure, by -2.08 mm Hg (95% CI -3.06, -1.05), and diastolic blood pressure, by -1.71 mm Hg (95% CI -2.86, -0.56), compared to the control. Changes in lipid profile, blood glucose and body mass index were also assessed in the meta-analysis. A significant reduction was found in total cholesterol (-0.15 mmol/L [95% CI -0.27, -0.02]) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.16 mmol/L [95% CI -0.22, -0.09]). Changes in other parameters did not reach statistical significance. Subgroup analysis suggested a greater reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in studies that included participants with a baseline mean systolic blood pressure of ≥ 130 mm Hg, and studies involving consuming green tea as an extract. Conclusion: The present meta-analysis suggests that green tea and its catechins may improve blood pressure, and the effect may be greater in those with systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg.

This non-systematic literature review presents the clinical evidence to date. Method: A literature review of peer-reviewed articles on observational and interventional studies was conducted to include green tea, its extract or its purified polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Electronic databases searched included PubMed (1966-2009) and the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2008). Results: Observational studies are inconclusive on the benefits of habitual consumption of green tea in the prevention of most cancers. However, there are trends towards prevention in breast and prostate cancers. Interventional studies have demonstrated reduction in relapses following surgical resection in colorectal adenomas and increased survival rates in epithelial ovarian cancer. Observational studies indicate that green tea may provide protection against hypertension and reduce the risk for stroke, and interventional studies are providing biochemical and physiological evidence.

Green tea is widely known to be potent antioxidant. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the effects of green tea in a model of hypertension. Methods: Hypertension was induced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor [N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME); 20 mg/kg per day, orally, for 2 weeks] in male Wistar rats. After the first week of L-NAME treatment, animals received green tea ad libitum for 1 week. At the end of the treatment period, blood pressure, heart rate, baroreflex sensitivity, renal sympathetic nerve activity, and vascular and systemic oxidative stress were assessed. Results: L-NAME-treated animals exhibited an increase in blood pressure (165 ± 2 mmHg) compared with control rats (103 ± 1 mmHg) and green tea treatment reduced hypertension (119 ± 1 mmHg). Hypertensive animals showed a higher renal sympathetic nerve activity (161 ± 12 spikes/s) than the control group (97 ± 2 spikes/s), and green tea also decreased this parameter in the hypertensive treated group (125 ± 5 spikes/s). Arterial baroreceptor function and vascular and systemic oxidative stress were improved in hypertensive rats after green tea treatment.

Although some interventional trials suggest that green tea has beneficial effects on CVD risk factors, such as hypertension and obesity, others have failed to show such benefits. Aims: To evaluate the short-term effects of green tea on blood pressure, endothelial function, metabolic profile, and inflammatory activity in obese prehypertensive women. Methods: This study was a crossover, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants were randomly allocated to receive daily 3 capsules containing either 500 mg of green tea extract (GTE) or a matching placebo for 4 weeks, with a washout period of 2 weeks between treatments. Each GTE capsule contained 260 mg of polyphenols. At the beginning and at the end of each treatment, participants were submitted to evaluation of blood pressure (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, ABPM), endothelial function (Endo-PAT 2000 and cellular adhesion molecules), nutritional parameters, metabolic profile, and biomarkers of inflammation.

Tea is the major contributor to total flavonoid intake in many populations. Flavonoids in tea have been shown to have a range of activities and effects that could contribute to improved health. Tea intake and the intake of flavonoids found in tea have been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease in several cross-sectional and prospective population studies. A variety of possible mechanisms have been investigated. The focus of the present review is on the mounting evidence that tea flavonoids can improve endothelial function and lower blood pressure. 3. In vitro studies using isolated vessels have shown that tea flavonoids possess vasodilator activity. Results of human intervention trials have shown that increased flavonoid intake from tea, as well as other dietary sources, can improve endothelial function. Emerging data also suggest that the degree of benefit may be related to flavonoid metabolism. 4. The effects of tea flavonoids on blood pressure are less consistent. Results of animal studies and population studies are consistent with a blood pressure-lowering effect of tea. However, short-term intervention trials, mainly in normotensive individuals, have not demonstrated any blood pressure reduction with tea. 5. Overall, the available data suggest that the effects of tea flavonoids on endothelial function and, perhaps, blood pressure may be responsible, at least in part, for any benefits of drinking tea on the risk of cardiovascular disease.",Can green tea reduce blood pressure?,green tea reduce blood pressure,1.0,Can green tea reduce blood pressure?,0.9192731976509094

Flavonoids have been shown to have antioxidant and vasodilator effects in vitro; we therefore postulated that drinking green or black tea attenuates the well-characterized acute pressor response to caffeine and lowers blood pressure during regular consumption. Objective: To determine whether green and black tea can attenuate the transient pressor effect of caffeine, or lower blood pressure during regular consumption. Methods: In the first study, the acute effects of four hot drinks - green tea and black tea (at a dose equivalent to four standard cups), water matched to the teas for caffeine content ('caffeine') and water - were assessed in 20 normotensive men using a Latin-Square designed study. Clinic blood pressure was measured before and 30 and 60 min after each drink had been ingested. In the second study, the effects on blood pressure of regular green and black tea ingestion were examined in 13 subjects with high-normal systolic blood pressure and mild systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure in the range 130-150 mmHg) using a three-period crossover study. Five cups per day of green tea, black tea and caffeine (in hot water and matched to the teas) were consumed for 7 days each, in random order. Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured at the end of each seven-day intervention. Results are presented as means and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: An acute pressor response to caffeine was observed. Relative to caffeine, there were further acute increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 30 min among those drinking green tea [5.5 mmHg (95%CI -1.4 to 12.4) and 3.1 mmHg (95%CI -0.1 to 6.3), respectively] and black tea [10.7 mmHg (95%CI 4.0 to 17.4) and 5.1 mmHg (95%CI 1.8 to 8.4), respectively].

Green tea is characterized by the presence of a high concentrations of polyphenolic compounds known as catechins, with (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) being the most abundant and most well-studied. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex condition that is defined by the presence of elevated waist circumference, dysglycemia, elevated blood pressure, decrease serum high-density lipoprotein-associated cholesterol, and increased serum triglycerides. Studies in both in vitro and laboratory animal models have examined the preventive effects of green tea and EGCG against the symptoms of MetS. Overall, the results of these studies have been promising and demonstrate that green tea and EGCG have preventive effects in both genetic and dietary models of obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.

210,misbelief,23685048,"The extract of ginger, the rhizomes of Zingiber officinale Roscoe (Zingiberaceae), has been reported to possess anti-hyperactivity and anti-inflammation on airway. The present study described brochodilatory activity of ginger oil and identified its active compound. Ginger oil was extracted by hydro-distillation. The compositions of ginger oil were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometer. Citral, eucalyptol and camphene were found to be the major components. Ginger oil and citral, but not camphene, suppressed rat tracheal contraction induced by carbachol (CCh). Consistent with previous report, eucalyptol showed a relaxing effect on rat airway. Since the content of eucalyptol in ginger oil was relatively low, the contribution of eucalyptol to the bronchodilatory effect of ginger oil was small. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the myorelaxing effect, propranolol (a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist), indomethacin (a COX inhibitor) and L-NAME (a NOS inhibitor) were used to block the inhibitory effects of ginger oil and citral. It was found that propranolol, but not indomethacin and L-NAME, reversed bronchodilatory effects of both ginger oil and citral, suggesting that a possible mechanism involved β-adrenergic receptor.

210,misbelief,26413316,"Background: Pertussis or ""whooping cough"" is an acute, communicable infection of the respiratory tract caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It has been recorded in history of medicine that the first pertussis epidemic was reported in 1578 by a French scientist, Guillaume de Baillou, in Paris. Furthermore, the causative agent was first isolated in 1906 by Jules Jean Baptiste Vincent Bordet and his brother-in-law Octave Gengou. However, it seems that earlier reports can be found in history of medicine. Objectives: The aim of this study as to analyze the first Report of Epidemic Pertussis by Bahaodowle Razi From the 15th Century Anno Domini. Materials and methods: We investigated a copy (Persian lithograph) of the book named ""a summary of experiences in medicine"", written by Bahaoddin-bin-Ghasem-Bahaoddin Razi (well known as Bahaodowle Razi) in 1502 to find the earliest existing report of epidemic pertussis in the history. Results: Bahaodowle Razi, a Persian physician from the 15th century Anno Domini (AD), reported two epidemics in Harat and one in Rey (inold Persia) for the first time, one century before Baillou. He named it as Sorfe-ie-Am (meaning public cough). Those occurred during his lifetime. Explaining about his observations and experiences about this epidemic, Bahaodowle Razi elaborated on prognosis, symptoms, etiology and predisposing factors of pertussis. Conclusions: This document shows that Bahaodowle Razi's report was the first report of epidemic pertussis in the medical history.",Does ginger help with cough?,ginger help cough,1.0,Does ginger help with cough?,0.9681321978569031

210,misbelief,35600836,"Background: Chronic cough management necessitates a clear integrated care pathway approach. Primary care physicians initially encounter the majority of chronic cough patients, yet their role in proper management can prove challenging due to limited access to advanced diagnostic testing. A multidisciplinary approach involving otolaryngologists and chest physicians, allergists, and gastroenterologists, among others, is central to the optimal diagnosis and treatment of conditions which underly or worsen cough. These include infectious and inflammatory, upper and lower airway pathologies, or gastro-esophageal reflux. Despite the wide armamentarium of ancillary testing conducted in cough multidisciplinary care, such management can improve cough but seldom resolves it completely. This can be due partly to the limited data on the role of tests (eg, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide), as well as classical pharmacotherapy conducted in multidisciplinary specialties for chronic cough. Other important factors include presence of multiple concomitant cough trigger mechanisms and the central neuronal complexity of chronic cough. Subsequent management conducted by cough specialists aims at control of cough refractory to prior interventions and includes cough-specific behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy with neuromodulators, among others. Preliminary data on the role of neuromodulators in a proof-of-concept manner are encouraging but lack strong evidence on efficacy and safety. Objectives: The World Allergy Organization (WAO)/Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) Joint Committee on Chronic Cough reviewed the recent literature on management of chronic cough in primary, multidisciplinary, and cough-specialty care. Knowledge gaps in diagnostic testing, classical and neuromodulator pharmacotherapy, in addition to behavioral therapy of chronic cough were also analyzed. Outcomes: This third part of the WAO/ARIA consensus on chronic cough suggests a management algorithm of chronic cough in an integrated care pathway approach. Insights into the inherent limitations of multidisciplinary cough diagnostic testing, efficacy and safety of currently available antitussive pharmacotherapy, or the recently recognized behavioral therapy, can significantly improve the standards of care in patients with chronic cough.",Does ginger help with cough?,ginger help cough,1.0,Does ginger help with cough?,0.9263525605201721

A chronic cough is a non-specific reaction to irritation anywhere in the respiratory system. It usually lasts for more than eight weeks. The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of a modified traditional Persian medicine preparation, licorice pastille, in healing a chronic cough. Methods: Through a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in a respiratory disease clinic in Shiraz, Iran; between October 2016 and December 2017. Seventy participants with a chronic cough took part in the trial. The outcome measures were as the daily cough scores (the score being logged via patient symptoms, diary, and the visual analogue scale) and the quality of life measure of chronic cough according to the Leicester Cough Questionnaire. Results: At baseline, there were no significant differences in the demographic or clinical (cough score) characteristics between the two groups. There was complete adherence to protocol in both groups but, the drop-out rate was 4 patients in the placebo and 6 ones in the intervention groups. The results at the end of the trial (Week 2) and follow-up (Week 4) demonstrated the efficacy of the licorice pastille in terms of the cough severity score against the placebo group. This item showed a significant decrease in the intervention group (1.2 ± 0.93) comparing to the placebo one (1.8 ± 1.03) at follow-up time.

Liquiritin apioside (1), liquiritin (2), and liquiritigenin (3) at 50 mg/kg (i.g.) could significantly decrease cough frequency by 30-78% (p .01). The antitussive effects could be partially antagonized by the pretreatment of methysergide or glibenclamide, but not naloxone. Moreover, compounds 1-3 showed potent expectorant activities after 3 days treatment (p .05). The water and ethanol extracts of licorice, which contain abundant 1 and 2, could decrease cough frequency at 200 mg/kg by 25-59% (p .05), and enhance the phenol red secretion (p .05), while the ethyl acetate extract showed little effect.

It consists of a variety of chemical components including triterpenoid saponins, polysaccharides, flavonoids, polyphenols, polyethylene glycols, volatile oils and mineral components, which have medicinal and edible value. Purpose: The ultimate goal of this review is to summarize the phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, safety and uses of PG in local and traditional medicine. Methods: A comprehensive search of published literature up to March 2022 was conducted using the PubMed, China Knowledge Network and Web of Science databases to identify original research related to PG, its active ingredients and pharmacological activities. Results: Triterpene saponins are the primary bioactive compounds of PG. To date, 76 triterpene saponin compounds have been isolated and identified from PG. In addition, there are other biological components, such as flavonoids, polyacetylene and phenolic acids. These extracts possess antitussive, immunostimulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, antiobesity, antidepressant, and cardiovascular system activities. The mechanisms of expression of these pharmacological effects include inhibition of the expression of proteins such as MDM and p53, inhibition of the activation of enzymes, such as AKT, the secretion of inflammatory factors, such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2 and IL-1β, and activation of the AMPK pathway. Conclusion: This review summarizes the chemical composition, pharmacological activities, molecular mechanism, toxicity and uses of PG in local and traditional medicine over the last 12 years. PG contains a wide range of chemical components, among which triterpene saponins, especially platycoside D (PD), play a strong role in pharmacological activity, representing a natural phytomedicine with low toxicity that has applications in food, animal feed and cosmetics.

211,misbelief,21631586,"Cigarette smoking is associated with an increased incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, we hypothesized that liquiritin apioside (LA), a main flavonoid component from Glycyrrhiza uralensis, had antioxidant properties by inducing glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis via the inhibition of cytokines and protected lung epithelial cells against cigarette smoke-mediated oxidative stress. A549 cells were treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and/or LA. ICR mice were exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) for four days with increasing exposure time for up to 6 h per day to elicit epithelial cells injury. One hour before smoke exposure, mice were treated with LA by gavage; 18 h after the last CS exposure all examinations were performed. Treatment with LA concentration-dependently prevented CSE-induced cytotoxicity, increase of TGF-β and TNF-α mRNA expression, depletion of GSH and apoptosis in A549 cells. LA at doses 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg dose-dependently inhibited pulmonary neutrophil and macrophage inflammation. Lung sections of the CS-exposed LA treated mice showed an apparently reduced pulmonary inflammation and a significant inhibitory effect on mucus containing goblet cells in the large airways. Furthermore, the CS-induced pulmonary release of TGF-β, TNF-α and myeloperoxidase activity was reduced, and superoxide dismutase activity was enhanced.These results indicate that protective roles of LA on CS-induced the lung epithelial cell injury are mediated by inhibiting TGF-β and TNF-α expression and increasing anti-oxidative levels of GSH, suggesting that LA might be effective as protective agent against epithelial injury in COPD.",Does licorice root help with cough?,licorice root help cough,1.0,Does licorice root help with cough?,0.9530013799667358

212,misbelief,29042288,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Native Americans used plants from the genus Echinacea to treat a variety of different inflammatory conditions including swollen gums, sore throats, skin inflammation, and gastrointestinal disorders. Today, various Echinacea spp. preparations are used primarily to treat upper respiratory infections. Aim of the study: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of an ethanolic E. purpurea (L) Moench root extract and the alkylamide dodeca-2E,4E-dienoic acid isobutylamide (A15) on mast cells, which are important mediators of allergic and inflammatory responses. Inhibition of mast cell activation may help explain the traditional use of Echinacea. Materials and methods: A15 was evaluated for its effects on degranulation, calcium influx, cytokine and lipid mediator production using bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) and the transformed rat basophilic leukemia mast cell line RBL-2H3. Methods included enzymatic assays, fluorimetry, ELISAs, and microscopy. A root extract of E. purpurea, and low and high alkylamide-containing fractions prepared from this extract, were also tested for effects on mast cell function. Finally, we tested A15 for effects on calcium responses in RAW 264.7 macrophage and Jurkat T cell lines. Results: A15 inhibited ß-hexosaminidase release from BMMCs and RBL-2H3 cells after treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 by 83.5% and 48.4% at 100µM, respectively. Inhibition also occurred following stimulation with IgE anti-DNP/DNP-HSA. In addition, A15 inhibited 47% of histamine release from A23187-treated RBL-2H3 cells. A15 prevented the rapid rise in intracellular calcium following FcεRI crosslinking and A23187 treatment suggesting it acts on the signals controlling granule release. An E. purpurea root extract and a fraction with high alkylamide content derived from this extract also displayed these activities while fractions with little to no detectable amounts of alkylamide did not. A15 mediated inhibition of calcium influx was not limited to mast cells as A23187-stimulated calcium influx was blocked in both RAW 264.7 and Jurkat cell lines with 60.2% and 43.6% inhibition at 1min post-stimulation, respectively. A15 also inhibited the release of TNF-α, and PGE 2 to a lesser degree, following A23187 stimulation indicating its broad activity on mast cell mediator production. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Echinacea extracts and alkylamides may be useful for treating allergic and inflammatory responses mediated by mast cells. More broadly, since calcium is a critical second messenger, the inhibitory effects of alkylamides on calcium uptake would be predicted to dampen a variety of pathological responses, suggesting new uses for this plant and its constituents.",Does echinacea boost immunity?,echinacea boost immunity,1.0,Does echinacea boost immunity?,0.944520115852356

Alcohol extracts from three widely used Echinacea species, Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea pallida, and Echinacea purpurea, were investigated for immunomodulating properties. The three Echinacea species demonstrated a broad difference in concentrations of individual lipophilic amides and hydrophilic caffeic acid derivatives. Mice were gavaged once a day (for 7 days) with one of the Echinacea extracts (130 mg/kg) or vehicle and immunized with sheep red blood cells (sRBC) 4 days prior to collection of immune cells for multiple immunological assays. The three herb extracts induced similar, but differential, changes in the percentage of immune cell populations and their biological functions, including increased percentages of CD49+ and CD19+ lymphocytes in spleen and natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Antibody response to sRBC was significantly increased equally by extracts of all three Echinacea species. Concanavalin A-stimulated splenocytes from E. angustifolia- and E. pallida-treated mice demonstrated significantly higher T cell proliferation. In addition, the Echinacea treatment significantly altered the cytokine production by mitogen-stimulated splenic cells. The three herbal extracts significantly increased interferon-alpha production, but inhibited the release of tumor necrosis factor-gamma and interleukin (IL)-1beta. Only E. angustifolia- and E. pallida-treated mice demonstrated significantly higher production of IL-4 and increased IL-10 production.

Infections and their associated symptoms are the common and frequent challenges to human health that are causing severe economic and social consequences around the world. During aging, human immune system undergoes dramatic aging-related changes/dysfunctions known as immunosenescence. Clinically, immunosenescence refers to the gradual deterioration of immune system that increases exposure to infections, and reduces vaccine efficacy. Such phenomenon is linked to impaired immune responses that lead to dysfunction of multiple organs, while lack of physical activity, progressive loss of muscle mass, and concomitant decline in muscle strength facilitate immunosenescence and inflammation. In the present review, we have discussed the role of nutrition and PA, which can boost the immune system alone and synergistically. Evidence suggests that long-term PA is beneficial in improving immune system and preventing various infections. We have further discussed several nutritional strategies for improving the immune system. Unfortunately, the available evidence shows conflicting results. In terms of interaction with food intake, PA does not tend to increase energy intake during a short time course. However, overcoming nutritional deficiencies appears to be the most practical recommendation. Through the balanced nutritious diet intake one can fulfill the bodily requirement of optimal nutrition that significantly impacts the immune system. Supplementation of a single nutrient as food is generally not advisable. Rather incorporating various fruits and vegetables, whole grains, proteins and probiotics may ensure adequate nutrient intake. Therefore, multi-nutrient supplements may benefit people having deficiency in spite of sufficient diet.

The pathogenesis and complications advanced with infection mainly involve immune-inflammatory cascade. Therefore, the therapeutic strategy relies on immune modulation, reducing infectivity and inflammation. Given the interplay of infection and immune-inflammatory axis, the natural products received attention for preventive and therapeutic usage in COVID-19 due to their potent antiviral and anti-immunomodulatory activities. Recently, Echinacea preparations, particularly E. purpurea, have been suggested to be an important antiviral agent to be useful in COVID-19 by modulating virus entry, internalization and replication. In principle, the immune response and the resultant inflammatory process are important for the elimination of the infection, but may have a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and may play a role in the clinical spectrum of COVID-19. Considering the pharmacological effects, therapeutic potential, and molecular mechanisms of Echinacea , we hypothesize that it could be a reasonably possible candidate for targeting infection, immunity, and inflammation in COVID-19 with recent recognition of cannabinoid-2 (CB2) receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) mediated mechanisms of bioactive components that make them notable immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antiviral agent. The plausible reason for our hypothesis is that the presence of numerous bioactive agents in different parts of plants that may synergistically exert polypharmacological actions in regulating immune-inflammatory axis in COVID-19. Our proposition is to scientifically contemplate the therapeutic perspective and prospect of Echinacea on infection, immunity, and inflammation with a potential in COVID-19 to limit the severity and progression of the disease.

It has been established as a potential therapeutic antioxidant agent for various biodiverse ailments. Data report that it exhibits strong wound healing, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral, and antidiabetic effects. It also retains immunomodulatory, estrogenic regulatory, antimutagenic, anticancer, and numerous other vigor effects. Data also show that honey, as a conventional therapy, might be a novel antioxidant to abate many of the diseases directly or indirectly associated with oxidative stress. In this review, these wholesome effects have been thoroughly reviewed to underscore the mode of action of honey exploring various possible mechanisms. Evidence-based research intends that honey acts through a modulatory road of multiple signaling pathways and molecular targets. This road contemplates through various pathways such as induction of caspases in apoptosis; stimulation of TNF- α , IL-1 β , IFN- γ , IFNGR1, and p53; inhibition of cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest; inhibition of lipoprotein oxidation, IL-1, IL-10, COX-2, and LOXs; and modulation of other diverse targets.

It, moreover, has both antibacterial and antiviral properties. Objectives: This study aimed to examine how people consume chestnut honey as a form of traditional medicine and how it might protect them from COVID-19. Methods: This study was carried out on 177 people (who had been snowball sampled) from a province in Turkey where chestnut honey is widely produced. The data was collected using a 20-open/closed-question online questionnaire form that asked the participants to report their sociodemographic details, how they consume chestnut honey, and about COVID-19. Results: 41.8% of the participants reported that they used chestnut honey to protect themselves against COVID-19, 40.7% believed that chestnut honey helped to make them immune against COVID-19, and 37.3% felt that chestnut honey could treat COVID-19. However, there was no significant relationship between the participants consuming chestnut honey and their either being tested for COVID-19 ( p &gt; 0.05, χ sup&gt;2 /sup&gt; = 1.080) or testing positive for COVID-19 ( p &gt; 0.05, χ sup&gt;2 /sup&gt; = 0.793).

The highest virulent, colony killing, bacterial agents are Paenibacillus larvae causing American foulbrood (AFB), and European foulbrood (EFB) associated bacteria. Besides the innate immune defense, honeybees evolved behavioral defenses to combat infections. Foraging of antimicrobial plant compounds plays a key role for this ""social immunity"" behavior. Secondary plant metabolites in floral nectar are known for their antimicrobial effects. Yet, these compounds are highly plant specific, and the effects on bee health will depend on the floral origin of the honey produced. As worker bees not only feed themselves, but also the larvae and other colony members, honey is a prime candidate acting as self-medication agent in honeybee colonies to prevent or decrease infections. Here, we test eight AFB and EFB bacterial strains and the growth inhibitory activity of three honey types. Using a high-throughput cell growth assay, we show that all honeys have high growth inhibitory activity and the two monofloral honeys appeared to be strain specific. The specificity of the monofloral honeys and the strong antimicrobial potential of the polyfloral honey suggest that the diversity of honeys in the honey stores of a colony may be highly adaptive for its ""social immunity"" against the highly diverse suite of pathogens encountered in nature.

Using direct pre-infection incubation assays, we determined the in vitro virucidal effects of fresh garlic extract, its polar fraction, and the following garlic associated compounds: diallyl thiosulfinate (allicin), allyl methyl thiosulfinate, methyl allyl thiosulfinate, ajoene, alliin, deoxyalliin, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl trisulfide. Activity was determined against selected viruses including, herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, parainfluenza virus type 3, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and human rhinovirus type 2. The order for virucidal activity generally was: ajoene &gt; allicin &gt; allyl methyl thiosulfinate &gt; methyl allyl thiosulfinate. Ajoene was found in oil-macerates of garlic but not in fresh garlic extracts. No activity was found for the garlic polar fraction, alliin, deoxyalliin, diallyl disulfide, or diallyl trisulfide. Fresh garlic extract, in which thiosulfinates appeared to be the active components, was virucidal to each virus tested. The predominant thiosulfinate in fresh garlic extract was allicin. Lack of reduction in yields of infectious virus indicated undetectable levels of intracellular antiviral activity for either allicin or fresh garlic extract. Furthermore, concentrations that were virucidal were also toxic to HeLa and Vero cells. Virucidal assay results were not influenced by cytotoxicity since the compounds were diluted below toxic levels prior to assaying for infectious virus. These results indicate that virucidal activity and cytotoxicity may have depended upon the viral envelope and cell membrane, respectively.

Garlic and its active organosulfur compounds (OSCs) have been reported to alleviate a number of viral infections in pre-clinical and clinical investigations. However, so far no systematic review on its antiviral effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms exists. Scope and approach: The aim of this review is to systematically summarize pre-clinical and clinical investigations on antiviral effects of garlic and its OSCs as well as to further analyse recent findings on the mechanisms that underpin these antiviral actions. PubMed, Cochrane library, Google Scholar and Science Direct databases were searched and articles up to June 2020 were included in this review. Key findings and conclusions: Pre-clinical data demonstrated that garlic and its OSCs have potential antiviral activity against different human, animal and plant pathogenic viruses through blocking viral entry into host cells, inhibiting viral RNA polymerase, reverse transcriptase, DNA synthesis and immediate-early gene 1(IEG1) transcription, as well as through downregulating the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The alleviation of viral infection was also shown to link with immunomodulatory effects of garlic and its OSCs. Clinical studies further demonstrated a prophylactic effect of garlic in the prevention of widespread viral infections in humans through enhancing the immune response.

A negotiated immune system is a common risk factor for all viral infections, including COVID-19. To date, no specific therapies or vaccines have been approved for coronavirus. In these circumstances, antiviral and immune boosting foods may ensure protection against viral infections, especially SARS-CoV-2 by reducing risk and ensuring fast healing of SARS-CoV-2 illness. Scope and approach: In this review, we have conducted an online search using several search engines (Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct) to find out some traditional foods (plant, animal and fungi species), which have antiviral and immune-boosting properties against numerous viral infections, particularly coronaviruses (CoVs) and others RNA-virus infections. Our review indicated some foods to be considered as potential immune enhancers, which may help individuals to overcome viral infections like COVID-19 by modulating immune systems and reducing respiratory problems. Furthermore, this review will provide information regarding biological properties of conventional foods and their ingredients to uphold general health. Key findings and conclusions: We observed some foods with antiviral and immune-boosting properties, which possess bioactive compounds that showed significant antiviral properties against different viruses, particularly RNA viruses such as CoVs. Interestingly, some antiviral and immune-boosting mechanisms were very much similar to the antiviral drug of COVID-19 homologous SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus). The transient nature and the devastating spreading capability of COVID-19 lead to ineffectiveness of many curative therapies.

Moreover, clinical studies proved an association between harmless upper respiratory tract infections and more severe diseases e.g. sinusitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Both the medicinal and socio-economic impact of HRV infections and the lack of antiviral drugs substantiate the need for intensive antiviral research. A common structural feature of the approximately 100 HRV serotypes is the icosahedrally shaped capsid formed by 60 identical copies of viral capsid proteins VP1-4. The capsid protects the single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome of about 7,400 bases in length. Both structural as well as nonstructural proteins produced during the viral life cycle have been identified as potential targets for blocking viral replication at the step of attachment, entry, uncoating, RNA and protein synthesis by synthetic or natural compounds. Moreover, interferon and phytoceuticals were shown to protect host cells. Most of the known inhibitors of HRV replication were discovered as a result of empirical or semi-empirical screening in cell culture. Structure-activity relationship studies are used for hit optimization and lead structure discovery. The increasing structural insight and molecular understanding of viral proteins on the one hand and the advent of innovative computer-assisted technologies on the other hand have facilitated a rationalized access for the discovery of small chemical entities with antirhinoviral (anti-HRV) activity.

UV, ozone and high pressure are non-thermal processing technologies that have potential to inactivate human pathogens on produce and allow the retention of fresh-like organoleptic properties. The objective of this study was to determine if UV, ozone, and high pressure are effective technologies compared to traditional chlorine spray on green onions to reduce enteric viral pathogens and to determine the effect of location of the virus (surface or internalized) on the efficacy of these processes. Mature green onion plants were inoculated with murine norovirus (MNV), hepatitis A virus (HAV) and human adenovirus type 41 (Ad41) either on the surface through spot inoculation or through inoculating contaminated hydroponic solution allowing for uptake of the virus into the internal tissues. Inoculated green onions were treated with UV (240 mJ s/cm(2)), ozone (6.25 ppm for 10 min), pressure (500 MPa, for 5 min at 20°C), or sprayed with calcium hypochlorite (150 ppm, 4°C). Viral inactivation was determined by comparing treated and untreated inoculated plants using cell culture infectivity assays. Processing treatments were observed to greatly affect viral inactivation. Viral inactivation for all three viruses was greatest after pressure treatment and the lowest inactivation was observed after chlorine and UV treatment. Both surface inoculated viruses and viruses internalized in green onions were inactivated to some extent by these post-harvest processing treatments.

This work demonstrated the effects of low heat dehydration on inactivating hepatitis A virus (HAV) on contaminated green onions. Inoculated and uninoculated onion samples were dehydrated at target temperatures of 45-65 °C for 20 h. HAV from artificially contaminated onions (fresh or dehydrated) was eluted by shaking at 145 rpm at 20 °C for 20 min with 3% beef extract, pH 8, and followed by 0.2 μM-membrane filtration before plaque assay and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Dilutions of the filtrates were made for obtaining countable plaques on FRhK-4 cell monolayers in 6-well plates, and also for eliminating inhibitors in qRT-PCR. Average water activity of the onions after 20 h-dehydration was 0.227, regardless of temperature used (47.9 °C or 65.1 °C). Eight dehydration trials resulted in a linear relationship between HAV inactivation and dehydration temperature, with HAV log reduction = 0.1372x(°C) - 5.5572, r(2) = 0.88. Therefore, the 20 h-heating at 47.8, 55.1, and 62.4 °C reduced infectious HAV in onions by 1, 2, and 3 logs respectively, the Z value being 7.3 °C.

To determine the effect of water during HHP treatment on virus inactivation, a HuNoV surrogate, murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1), was inoculated onto green onions and then HHP-treated at 350MPa with or without water at 4 or 20°C. The presence of water enhanced HHP inactivation of MNV-1 on green onions at 4°C but not at 20°C. To test the temperature effect on HHP inactivation of MNV-1, inoculated green onions were HHP-treated at 300MPa at 1, 4 and 10°C. As the temperature decreased, MNV-1 became more sensitive to HHP treatment. HHP inactivation curves of MNV-1 on green onions and salsa were obtained at 300 or 350MPa for 0.5-3min at 1°C.

Although the fructan did not show anti-influenza A virus activity in vitro, it demonstrated an inhibitory effect on virus replication in vivo when it was orally administered to mice. In addition, the polysaccharide enhanced the production of neutralising antibodies against influenza A virus. Therefore, the antiviral mechanism of the polysaccharide seemed to be dependent on the host immune system, i.e., enhancement of the host immune function was achieved by the administration of the polysaccharide.

It causes dwarfing, yellow striping, crinkling and flaccidity of the leaves of onion and garlic. To see the occurrence and incidence of OYDV on Allium crop, an attempt was made to develop antibody based diagnostic assay which would be useful for routine indexing and screening of the germplasm. The total RNA was isolated from the symptomatic leaves of onion and the gene encoding coat protein (CP) was cloned. The nucleotide sequencing analysis of the cloned RT-PCR product revealed ~ 774 bp amplicon (OYDV CP) and it was further cloned in pET-28a ( +) expression vector which yielded ~ 30 kDa fusion protein with Histidine tag (His 6 BP). The expression of fusion CP was primarily checked on SDS-PAGE and further confirmed by Western blot. The His 6 BP-OYDV-CP was obtained in soluble state after purification and was used to immunize New Zealand white rabbit for the production of polyclonal antibody (PAb). The produced PAb against the purified fusion protein successfully detected OYDV from onion and garlic samples at 1:2000 dilutions in indirect-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAC-ELISA). Thus, this study presents first report that Histidine tag (His 6 BP) fusion OYDV-CP based antibody production and its successful application in identification of virus free onion and garlic genotypes.",Does onion kill viruses?,onion kill viruses,1.0,Does onion kill viruses?,0.7864494323730469
215,misbelief,31202851,"Onion yellow dwarf virus (OYDV) is one of the most important viral pathogens of onion. In particular, on 'Rossa di Tropea' onion, granted with Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) trademarks, this pathogen represents the most limiting biotic stress in terms of spread, severity of symptoms and damage, and its detection is necessary to preserve high quality standards and avoid yield losses. A reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed for detection of OYDV. The specificity, sensitivity, repeatability and reproducibility of the assay were validated according to EPPO standard PM7/98 (2). Diagnostic specificity, diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy were determined in both leaf and bulb tissues. To enhance the feasibility of a LAMP-based method for field diagnosis, several nucleic acid extraction methods were compared to simplify sample preparation. The results showed the reliability of the method for OYDV detection, with a limit of detection (LOD) comparable to real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The ease of sample preparation, and the more than acceptable LOD, indicated that the RT-LAMP assay could be used in plant pathology laboratories with limited facilities and resources, as well as directly in the field.

Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) vectored by Thrips tabaci Lindeman, is a major hindrance to onion production in eastern Africa. Control measures often rely on insecticides with deleterious effects. Endophytes are one key alternative as they can play important roles in mediating induced systemic resistance. Hence, we examined the potential effect of endophytic fungus Hypocrea lixii (F3ST1) on feeding and replication of IYSV on endophyte-colonized (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) onion plants. For more precise assessment, replication was also tested using leaf disk bioassays and individual thrips. The number of feeding punctures was significantly lower in E+ as compared to E- plants. Disease level was significantly lower in E+ as compared to E- plants for four weeks post-exposure to thrips. IYSV replication was reduced by 2.5-fold in endophytic treatment on both whole plant and leaf disk assays. Thrips tabaci showed 2 times higher feeding activities on endophyte-free onion leaf disks as compared to the endophyte-inoculated leaf disks. Our results suggest potential utility of the endophytes to reduce feeding damage and virus infection on onion plants. Further studies should be conducted to elucidate the secondary metabolites involved in such endophyte-thrips-virus mediated interaction and determine whether the interactions extend for this and other onion varieties and viruses under field conditions.",Does onion kill viruses?,onion kill viruses,1.0,Does onion kill viruses?,0.7692938446998596

Increased age-specific death rates for a disease may imply either more deaths from the disease with increased absolute lifetime risk, or earlier deaths, without increased absolute lifetime risk. The British doctor smoking data are re-analysed using lifetable methods for survival, cumulative mortality and the disease-specific cumulative mortality. The most significant effect of smoking is on survival: life shortening amounts to three years for light smokers, five for moderate smokers, and eight for heavy smokers, compared with those who never smoked. Smoking increases the absolute number of deaths from some causes, including lung cancer; for other causes, including ischaemic heart disease, it brings forward death without increasing the absolute number of deaths.

Methods: A retrospective study of 2128 death certificates and 236 postmortem reports issued at a large teaching hospital between 2003 and 2009. Results: Smoking was identified as the underlying COD on only 2 (0.1%) death certificates and included in part II of the death certificate on 10 (0.5%). The two death certificates citing smoking as the underlying COD were in cases of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study included 279 deaths in which these diagnoses were cited on the death certificate and in the majority of these cases the deceased was a smoker or ex-smoker. A review of postmortem reports from the same period failed to identify a single case in which the pathologist cited smoking as causing or contributing to death. In marked contrast to smoking, 57.4% (vs 0.5%) of death certificates, which included diagnoses linked to alcohol use, cited alcohol in part I of the death certificate. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that smoking is rarely cited on death certificates, even in cases where the causal link with smoking is very strong. There are many reasons why smoking is not cited on death certificates. One frequently cited reason is the reluctance of doctors to stigmatise the deceased. Interestingly, such reluctance did not extend to citing alcohol as a COD.

Smoking cigarettes is both psychologically and physiologically addictive. Smoking is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary artery disease, stroke, carcinoma of the lung, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emphysema. It also increases the risk for peripheral vascular disease and is associated with cancers of the larynx, oral cavity, esophagus, pancreas, and urinary bladder. Smoking by pregnant women can cause adverse health effects on their babies, like low birth weight and preterm delivery; increases the risk of miscarriage; and has also been found to be an important cause of sudden infant death syndrome.

The exact impact of changes in smoking habits throughout life on different mortality risks is less studied. Methods: We studied the impact of baseline and lifetime smoking habits, and duration of smoking on the risk of all-cause mortality, mortality of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), any cancer and of the four most common types of cancer (lung, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer) in a cohort study (Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen 1965-1990, with a follow-up on mortality status until 2009, n = 8,645). We used Cox regression models adjusted for age, BMI, sex, and place of residence. Since previous studies suggested a potential effect modification of sex, we additionally stratified by sex and tested for interactions. In addition, to determine which cause of death carried the highest risk we performed competing-risk analyses on mortality due to CVD, cancer, COPD and other causes. Results: Current smoking (light, moderate, and heavy cigarette smoking) and lifetime persistent smoking were associated with an increased risk of all-cause, CVD, COPD, any cancer, and lung cancer mortality. Higher numbers of pack years at baseline were associated with an increased risk of all-cause, CVD, COPD, any cancer, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer mortality. Males who were lifetime persistent pipe/cigar smokers had a higher risk of lung cancer [HR (95% CI) = 7.72 (1.72-34.75)] as well as all-cause and any cancer mortality. A longer duration of smoking was associated with a higher risk of COPD, any and lung cancer [HR (95% CI) = 1.06 (1.00-1.12), 1.03 (1.00-1.06) and 1.10 (1.03-1.17) respectively], but not with other mortality causes. The competing risk analyses showed that ex- and current smokers had a higher risk of cancer, CVD, and COPD mortality compared to all other mortality causes. In addition, heavy smokers had a higher risk for COPD mortality compared to cancer, and CVD mortality. Conclusion: Our study indicates that lifetime numbers of cigarettes smoked and the duration of smoking have different impacts for different causes of mortality. Moreover, our findings emphasize the importance of smoking-related competing risks when studying the smoking-related cancer mortality in a general population and that smoking cessation immediately effectively reduces the risk of all-cause and any cancer mortality.",Does smoking cause death?,smoking causes death,1.0,Does smoking cause death?,0.900515615940094
1_h,health_belief,30232778,"This study illuminates the association between cigarette smoking and adult mortality in the contemporary United States. Recent studies have estimated smoking-attributable mortality using indirect approaches or with sample data that are not nationally representative and that lack key confounders. We use the 1990-2011 National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality Files to estimate relative risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for current and former smokers compared with never smokers. We examine causes of death established as attributable to smoking as well as additional causes that appear to be linked to smoking but have not yet been declared by the U.S. Surgeon General to be caused by smoking. Mortality risk is substantially elevated among smokers for established causes and moderately elevated for additional causes. We also decompose the mortality disadvantage among smokers by cause of death and estimate the number of smoking-attributable deaths for the U.S. adult population ages 35+, net of sociodemographic and behavioral confounders. The elevated risks translate to 481,887 excess deaths per year among current and former smokers compared with never smokers, 14 % to 15 % of which are due to the additional causes. The additional causes of death contribute to the health burden of smoking and should be considered in future studies of smoking-attributable mortality.

The aim of present study was to analyse the effect of smoking on general and cause-specific mortality in the Estonian population. Methods: The data from 51,756 adults in the Estonian Genome Center of the University of Tartu was used. Information on dates and causes of death was retrieved from the National Causes of Death Registry. Smoking status, general survival, general mortality and cause-specific mortality were analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: The study found that smoking reduces median survival in men by 11.4 years and in women by 5.8 years. Tobacco smoking produces a very specific pattern in the cause of deaths, significantly increasing the risks for different cancers and cardiovascular diseases as causes of death for men and women. This study also identified that external causes, such as alcohol intoxication and intentional self-harm, are more prevalent causes of death among smokers than non-smokers. Additionally, smoking cessation was found to reverse the increased risks for premature mortality. Conclusions: Tobacco smoking remains the major cause for losses of life inducing cancers and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the common diseases, external causes also reduce substantially the years of life. External causes of death indicate that smoking has a long-term influence on the behaviour of smokers, provoking self-destructive behaviour.

1_h,health_belief,30723766,"More than 50 years after the U.S. Surgeon General's first report on cigarette smoking and mortality, smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. The first report established a causal association between smoking and lung cancer, and subsequent reports expanded the list of smoking-attributable causes of death to include other cancers, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and respiratory diseases. For a second level of causes of death, the current evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship with smoking. This study draws on 1980-2004 U.S. vital statistics data and applies a cause-specific version of the Preston-Glei-Wilmoth indirect method, which uses the association between lung cancer death rates and death rates for other causes of death to estimate the fraction and number of deaths attributable to smoking overall and by cause. Nearly all of the established and additional causes of death are positively associated with lung cancer mortality, suggesting that the additional causes are in fact attributable to smoking. I find 420,284 annual smoking-attributable deaths at ages 50+ for years 2000-2004, 14% of which are due to the additional causes. Results corroborate recent estimates of cause-specific smoking-attributable mortality using prospective cohort data that directly measure smoking status.

Additionally, cigarette smoking is a direct cause of ischaemic heart disease (the commonest cause of death in western countries), respiratory heart disease, aortic aneurysm, chronic obstructive lung disease, stroke, pneumonia and cirrhosis and cancer of the liver. Cigarette smoking can kill in 24 different ways and, although smoking protects against several fatal and non-fatal conditions, the adverse effect of smoking on health is largely negative. In developed countries as a whole, tobacco is responsible for 24% of all male deaths and 7% of all female deaths: these figures rise to over 40% in men in some countries of central and eastern Europe and to 17% in women in the United States. The average loss of life of smokers is 8 years. Among United Kingdom doctors followed for 40 years, overall death rates in middle age were about three times higher among doctors who smoked cigarettes as among doctors who had never smoked regularly. About half of all regular cigarette smokers will eventually be killed by their habit. The important information is that it is never too late to stop smoking: among United Kingdom doctors who stopped smoking, even in middle age, there was a substantial improvement in life expectancy. World-wide, smoking is killing three million people each year and this figure is increasing. In most countries the worst is yet to come, since by the time the young smokers of today reach middle or old age there will be about 10 million deaths/year from tobacco. Approximately 500 million individuals alive today can expect to be killed by tobacco, 250 million of these deaths will occur in middle age. Tobacco is already the biggest cause of adult death in developed countries. Over the next few decades tobacco could well become the biggest cause of adult death in the world. For men in developed countries, the full effects of smoking can already be seen. Tobacco now causes one-third of all male deaths in middle age (plus one fifth in old age). Tobacco is a cause of about half of all male cancer deaths in middle age (plus one-third in old age). Of those who start smoking in their teenage years and keep on smoking, about half will be killed by tobacco. Half of these deaths will be in middle age (35-69) and each will lose an average of 20-25 years of non-smoker life expectancy. In non-smokers in many countries, cancer mortality is decreasing slowly and total mortality rapidly. The war against cancer is being won slowly: the effects of cigarette smoking are holding back this victory. Lung cancer now kills more women in the United States each year than breast cancer. For women in developed countries, the peak of the tobacco epidemic has not yet arrived. Tobacco now causes almost one-third of all deaths in women in middle age in the United States. Although it has only 5% of the world's female population, the United States has 50% of the world's deaths from smoking in women. Tobacco smoking is a major cause of premature death. Throughout Europe, in 1990 tobacco smoking caused three quarters of a million deaths in middle age (between 35 and 69). In the Member States of the European Union in 1990 there were over one quarter of a million deaths in middle age directly caused by tobacco smoking: there were 219700 in men and 31900 in women. There were many more deaths caused by tobacco at older ages. In countries of central and eastern Europe, including the former USSR, there were 441200 deaths in middle age in men and 42100 deaths in women. There is a need for urgent action to help contain this important and unnecessary loss of life.

It is the major single cause of cancer mortality in the United States and is a causal factor for coronary heart disease and arteriosclerotic peripheral vascular disease; is associated with increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis; and is the most important cause of chronic obstructive lung disease. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of bladder, pancreatic, and renal cancer, and peptic ulcer disease. Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy causes: retarded fetal growth; an increased risk for spontaneous abortion, fetal death, and neonatal death; and, possibly, slight impairment of growth and development during early childhood. Cigarette smoking acts synergistically with oral contraceptives to increases the risk for coronary heart disease and some forms of cerebrovascular disease; with alcohol to increase the risk of cancer of the larynx, oral cavity, and esophagus; with asbestos and some other occupationally encountered substances to increase the likelihood of cancer of the lung and larynx; and with other coronary risk factors such as hypercholesteremia to enhance cardiovascular risk. Smoking is the major identifiable cause of residential fire deaths and injuries as well as a contributor to accidental injuries. Cigarette smokers have a 70 percent higher overall death rate than nonsmokers, and tobacco is associated with an estimate in excess of 300,000 premature deaths a year. It is estimated that smoking contributes to as many as 225,000 deaths from coronary heart disease, the major cause of death among men and women in the United States; more than 100,000 deaths from cancers; and more than 20,000 deaths from chronic obstructive lung disease.

While there are many topical agents that claim to deliver wide-spectrum anti-aging benefits, few target all of the signs of skin aging to the same extent. Salicin, an extract from white willow bark, has been researched as a potent anti-inflammatory agent when taken orally. Based on unpublished in-house comprehensive consumer clinical studies, it is believed salicin may have anti-aging capabilities when applied topically to human skin. Aim: This research evaluated the effect of a topical serum formulation containing salicin at 0.5% on the visible signs of skin aging. Materials and methods: This single-center study enrolled 30 female subjects, showing mild to moderate signs of aging, between the ages of 35 and 70 having Fitzpatrick skin types ranging between I and IV. Subjects used the study serum product containing 0.5% salicin on their face twice daily for 12 weeks.

2_h,health_belief,24527317,"Significance: Although most researches into the changes in skin with age focus on the unwelcome aesthetic aspects of the aging skin, skin deterioration with age is more than a merely cosmetic problem. Although mortality from skin disease is primarily restricted to melanoma, dermatological disorders are ubiquitous in older people with a significant impact on quality of life. The structural and functional deterioration of the skin that occurs with age has numerous clinical presentations, ranging from benign but potentially excruciating disorders like pruritus to the more threatening carcinomas and melanomas. Recent advances: The degenerative changes that occur in the aging skin are increasingly understood at both the molecular and cellular level, facilitating a deeper understanding of the structural and functional deterioration that these changes produce. Critical issues: A loss of both function and structural stability in skin proceeds unavoidably as individuals age, which is the result of both intrinsic and extrinsic processes, which contribute simultaneously to a progressive loss of skin integrity. Intrinsic aging proceeds at a genetically determined pace, primarily caused by the buildup of damaging products of cellular metabolism as well as an increasing biological aging of the cells. Estrogen levels strongly influence skin integrity in women as well; falling levels in midlife, therefore, produce premature aging as compared with similarly aged men. Extrinsic insults from the environment add to the dermatological signs of aging.

The medical literature on the relationship between diet and disease is steadily growing. Over the last decade, the possible connection between diet and many dermatological conditions has been studied, including skin aging. OBJECTIVE: As patients are increasingly seeking dietary advice from their dermatologist related to preventing and reversing the aging of skin, dermatologists need an evidence-based approach to tackle this challenging topic. This review focuses on dietary factors that contribute to telomere length, a marker for cellular aging. Although various factors contribute to accelerating telomere shortening, this review focuses on dietary factors that contribute to telomere length, specifically gerontotoxins and antioxidants. These can be measured in the blood, making them biomarkers of accelerated cellular skin aging. Included in this discussion is an evidence-based approach to increase the amount of antioxidants and decrease the amount of gerontotoxins in the diet, resulting in healthier skin. METHODS: A comprehensive MEDLINE (PubMed) literature review search was performed. Keywords used included: WFPB, telomerase, coronary artery disease, cellular aging, cigarette smoke, photoaging, telomeres, antioxidants, gerontotoxins, intrinsic cutaneous aging, extrinsic cutaneous aging, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin E, CoQ10, polyphenols, chlorophyll, zeaxanthin, polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and monounsaturated fatty acids . Inclusion criteria included the above stated keywords and access to full text. RESULTS: A WFPB diet maximizes the antioxidant potential within our cells by providing essential vitamins, including vitamins A, C, and E. It also helps to eliminate harmful carcinogens and gerontotoxins within our bloodstream and has been shown to lengthen telomeres, which prevents cellular damage.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of an antipollution and anti-aging suncare product in in vitro, ex vivo, and clinical studies. Methods: We assessed 1) sunburn cell (SBC) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) formation and gene expression profile in reconstructed human epidermis following solar irradiation, 2) malondialdehyde (MDA) level, Nrf2 immunostaining, and genetic expression in skin explants exposed to pollution, 3) carbon particle adhesion to healthy forearm skin in a clinical study, and 4) skin firmness, elasticity, and pigmentation spots in healthy women following 56 days of application. Results: 1) The product fully protected against CPD formation, and provided a high protection against SBC formation, with levels close to non-irradiated samples. Expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress response markers was lower in product-treated than untreated skin. 2) Compared with pollution-exposed untreated controls, product-treated skin had 23% lower MDA levels ( P 0.01), weaker Nrf2 immunostaining, and attenuated upregulation of CYP1A1 . 3) The product significantly decreased adhesion of carbon particles to the skin (15.2% less than control; P 0.01). 4) Clinically, product use led to a decrease in brown spots, with a relative reduction in the count of -1.9% (NS), and in area, -5.0% ( P 0.01), and decrease in UV spots, with a relative reduction of -6.9% ( P 0.01) and -9.3% ( P =0.02) for count and area, respectively.

2_h,health_belief,32105850,"Aging is a major cause of many degenerative diseases. The most intuitive consequence of aging is mainly manifested on the skin, resulting in cumulative changes in skin structure, function and appearance, such as increased wrinkles, laxity, elastosis, telangiectasia, and aberrant pigmentation of the skin. Unlike other organs of the human body, skin is not only inevitably affected by the intrinsic aging process, but also affected by various extrinsic environmental factors to accelerate aging, especially ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Skin aging is a highly complex and not fully understood process, and the lack of universal biomarkers for the definitive detection and evaluation of aging is also a major research challenge. Oxidative stress induced by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to lipid, protein, nucleic acid and organelle damage, thus leading to the occurrence of cellular senescence, which is one of the core mechanisms mediating skin aging. Autophagy can maintain cellular homeostasis when faced with different stress conditions and is one of the survival mechanisms of cell resistance to intrinsic and extrinsic stress. Autophagy and aging have many features in common and may be associated with skin aging mediated by different factors. Here, we summarize the changes and biomarkers of skin aging, and discuss the effects of oxidative stress and autophagy on skin aging.",Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,Does skin product cause aging?,0.8797692060470581

Background: Weight gain after adjuvant chemotherapy in women with breast cancer has negative impact on health outcomes. Design: Longitudinal, clinical observational study. Methods: Weights were repeatedly measured in 147 women with breast cancer stages I-III. Hierarchical linear modelling was used to analyse these longitudinal data. Results: The overall pattern of weight change was a cubic form beginning with a mean of 56·9 kg before chemotherapy. It gradually increased to 59·4 kg at 8·5 months after the first chemotherapy followed by a decrease to 58·5 kg at 21·5 months. During the last 2·5 months, weight increased slightly and never returned to the initial level. After controlling for confounders, steeper weight change was observed among women receiving cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil. The highest weight gain in the cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil group was 2·9 kg (5%) vs. 0·9 kg (1%) in the anthracycline-based group. Conclusion: The trajectory of body weight change within two years after chemotherapy shows a trend of gradual ascent, followed by a small decline and a slight increase in the last 2·5 months. The chemotherapy regimen can predict the trend after controlling for other confounders; women on cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil have a steeper weight change. Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses can inform women with breast cancer about the expected changes in body weight after chemotherapy to reduce their uncertainty.

The aim of this study was to provide a descriptive analysis of its use in two different European geographic areas (Sweden and Greece). Materials and methods: We retrospectively collected data regarding clinicopathologic characteristics, survival, and use of chemotherapy during the final 30 days of life using two sources: for the Swedish cohort, patients who were diagnosed with MBC in 2010-2015 were identified from the Stockholm-Gotland population-based Breast Cancer Registry and treatment data were collected using hospital charts. For the Greek cohort, patients with MBC were identified from hospital charts at two hospitals in Athens and Crete. Results: In the Swedish cohort, 1571 patients were identified; median overall survival was 16.96 months (95% CI 15.4-18.4). 23.2% of patients were treated with chemotherapy during the final month of life, with higher rates among patients ≤ 60 years (p 0.001). Per OS monotherapy such as capecitabine or vinorelbine was most commonly used. In contrast, median OS in the Greek cohort (n = 966) was 49.8 months (95% CI 45.6-54.1) and 46.5% of patients received chemotherapy at the end-of-life, most commonly intravenous drug combinations.

The purpose of this study was to assess and compare perceptions about chemotherapy of patients and health-care providers through analysis of chemo-related tweets. Materials and methods: Cancer-related Twitter accounts and their tweets were obtained through using Tweepy (Python library). Multiple text classification algorithms were tested to identify the models with best performance in classifying the accounts into individual and organization. Chemotherapy-specific tweets were extracted from historical tweetset, and the content of these tweets was analyzed using topic model, sentiment analysis and word co-occurrence network. Results: Using the description in Twitter users' profiles, the accounts related with cancer were collected and coded as individual or organization. We employed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with GloVe word embeddings to identify the user into individuals and organizations with accuracy of 85.2%. 13, 273 and 14,051 publicly available chemotherapy-related tweets were retrieved from individuals and organizations, respectively. The content of the chemo-related tweets was analyzed by text mining approaches. The tweets from individual accounts pertained to personal chemotherapy experience and emotions. In contrast with the personal users, professional accounts had a higher proportion of neutral tweets about side effects. The information about the assessment of response to chemotherapy was deficient from organizations on Twitter. Discussion: Examining chemotherapy discussions on Twitter provide new lens into content and behavioral patterns associated with treatments for cancer patients. The methodology described herein allowed us to collect relatively large number of health-related tweets over a greater time period and exploit the potential power of social media, which provide comprehensive view on patients' perceptions of chemotherapy. Conclusion: This study sheds light on using Twitter data as a valuable healthcare data source for helping oncologists (organizations) in understanding patients' experiences while undergoing chemotherapy, in developing personalize therapy plans, and a supplement to the clinical electronic medical records (EMRs).",Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,0.9223864674568176

The risk associated with specific chemotherapeutic agents, alone and in combination, has been characterized previously. In the current study, we sought to estimate the risk associated with newer regimens for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and common solid tumors. Methods: We reviewed published studies reporting phase II and III clinical trials of dose-dense regimens for breast cancer and NHL, TAC (docetaxel, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy for breast cancer, and infusional 5-fluorouracil-based regimens for colorectal cancer. Platinum-, gemcitabine-, and taxane-based regimens for lung cancer, either alone or in combination with radiotherapy, were also considered. Using modified meta-analysis methods, we calculated quality-adjusted estimates of the risk for oral and GI mucositis by tumor type and regimen. Case reports are used to emphasize the relevance of the findings for patient care. Main results: Our findings demonstrate that mucosal toxicity remains an important complication of cancer treatment. Moreover, innovations in drug combinations, scheduling, or mode of administration significantly modulate the risk for both oral and GI mucositis.

Patients were followed for up to 15 years from the initial diagnosis of breast cancer. Survival rates were estimated for women by age, tumor size (≤ 1 cm; &gt; 1 cm), ER status (±), and by chemotherapy (yes/no). 42 women died of breast cancer in the follow-up period (11.2 %). Survival rates were similar for women with cancers of size 0-1.0 cm and size 1.1-2.0 cm. Of the 267 women in the study who used chemotherapy, 21 had died (7.9 %) compared to 21 deaths among 112 women who did not receive chemotherapy (18.8 %; p = 0.002). The 15-year survival was 89.4 % for women who received chemotherapy and was 73.1 % for women who did not receive chemotherapy (p = 0.08; log rank).

Because of the pharmacologic properties of nicotine and other constituents of smokeless tobacco, there is also concern that smokeless tobacco products may lead to cardiovascular diseases as well. The relatively few human population studies to date conflict with respect to whether smokeless tobacco use elevates cardiovascular risk factors or leads to cardiovascular disease or death from cardiovascular causes. Hemoglobin adducts to carcinogens present in smokeless tobacco products are measurable in the blood of smokeless tobacco users, indicating that smokeless-tobacco-related carcinogens circulate throughout the body. This prompts a concern that smokeless tobacco may increase risks of other cancers as well. The evidence to date from epidemiologic studies indicates no relationship between smokeless tobacco and bladder cancer, but there is suggestive evidence linking smokeless tobacco use to prostate cancer risk. Only single studies have been conducted of some cancers, and inconsistencies among studies of the same cancer site have been reported.

Smokeless tobacco is very strongly related to cancers of the cheek and gums, locations typically in direct contact with the tobacco. The association is evident in studies in the US and Scandinavia and also in Asia, where the chewing of quids containing tobacco and other ingredients is strongly related to the region's high rates of oral cancer. Reports on health effects date back to the 18th century and the evidence is consistent, with most investigators reporting positive findings. Dose-response relationships--increasing risk with increasing use--are also evident in several studies. Finally, preliminary work on cancers in other anatomic sites suggests that smokeless tobacco may also be related to other upper digestive tract cancers. With the exception of one group of medical scientists who described the relationship as only an ""association,"" expert consensus conferences and committees in both the US and France have agreed that the evidence from clinical, epidemiologic, and carcinogenesis studies supports a causal relationship between the use of smokeless tobacco and oral cancer in humans.

Materials and methods: In this prospective study, a total of 25 cases of leukoplakia, 25 of tobacco pouch keratosis, and 50 of healthy controls were studied. Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) for the identification of Candida and HiCrome Candida differential Agar for the species identification of Candida were used. Calculation of salivary flow rate, pH, and buffer capacity was done with Saliva-Check Buffer kit (GC). Results: The prevalence of Candida carriage obtained was considerably greater in the study group associated with smokeless tobacco use. Non Candida albicans Candida species predominated over Candida albicans in speciation among study groups on HiCrome agar and Candida albicans predominated among control groups. Statistically significant values were obtained by comparing the salivary flow rate, pH, and buffer capacity between the study groups and control groups. Conclusion: The present study indicated Candida prevalence was seen more in study group than healthy control groups, suggesting increased Candida in smokeless tobacco users. The prevalence of Non Candida albicans Candida species among leukoplakia and tobacco pouch keratosis indicates that there is pervasiveness of significant Non Candida albican Candida species in relation to salivary flow rate and buffer capacity. Therefore, the choice of antifungal treatment promptly must deal with not only resistance but, similarly, with the transformation in predominance from Candida albicans to Non Candida albicans Candida species.

We review North American and European studies and compare effects of smokeless tobacco and smoking. Methods: We obtained papers from MEDLINE searches, published reviews and secondary references describing epidemiological cohort and case-control studies relating any form of cancer to smokeless tobacco use. For each study, details were abstracted on design, smokeless tobacco exposure, cancers studied, analysis methods and adjustment for smoking and other factors. For each cancer, relative risks or odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were tabulated. Overall, and also for USA and Scandinavia separately, meta-analyses were conducted using all available estimates, smoking-adjusted estimates, or estimates for never smokers. For seven cancers, smoking-attributable deaths in US men in 2005 were compared with deaths attributable to introducing smokeless tobacco into a population of never-smoking men. Results: Eighty-nine studies were identified; 62 US and 18 Scandinavian. Forty-six (52%) controlled for smoking. Random-effects meta-analysis estimates for most sites showed little association. Smoking-adjusted estimates were only significant for oropharyngeal cancer (1.36, CI 1.04-1.77, n = 19) and prostate cancer (1.29, 1.07-1.55, n = 4). The oropharyngeal association disappeared for estimates published since 1990 (1.00, 0.83-1.20, n = 14), for Scandinavia (0.97, 0.68-1.37, n = 7), and for alcohol-adjusted estimates (1.07, 0.84-1.37, n = 10). Any effect of current US products or Scandinavian snuff seems very limited. The prostate cancer data are inadequate for a clear conclusion.Some meta-analyses suggest a possible effect for oesophagus, pancreas, larynx and kidney cancer, but other cancers show no effect of smokeless tobacco. Any possible effects are not evident in Scandinavia. Of 142,205 smoking-related male US cancer deaths in 2005, 104,737 are smoking-attributable. Smokeless tobacco-attributable deaths would be 1,102 (1.1%) if as many used smokeless tobacco as had smoked, and 2,081 (2.0%) if everyone used smokeless tobacco.

Despite consensus that smokeless tobacco products as sold in the United States are less dangerous than cigarettes, there is no consensus on how to proceed. Diverse factions have different policy concerns. While the tobacco industry is exempted from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight, the pharmaceutical industry whose nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) medicines compete with smokeless tobacco as noncombustible nicotine-delivery systems are regulated by the FDA. Some public health experts support smokeless tobacco use to reduce population harm from tobacco; other public health experts oppose promoting smokeless tobacco for harm reduction. Adult consumers can freely purchase currently-marketed smokeless tobacco products and even more-deadly cigarettes. Concerns with and advantages of smokeless tobacco products are discussed. In that noncombustible medicinal nicotine-delivery systems have been proven to be effective smoking-cessation aids, smokeless tobacco, as another source of psychoactive doses of nicotine, could be used similarly, in a dose-response fashion as a smoking-cessation aid (consistent with FDA principles for evaluating generic versions of drugs). Price measures should be used on tobacco products to make costs to consumers proportional to product health risks (which would make smokeless tobacco much cheaper than cigarettes), and smokeless tobacco should be encouraged as an option for smoking cessation in adult smokers, particularly for those who have failed to stop smoking using NRT or other methods.",Does smokeless tobacco cause cancer?,smokeless tobacco causes cancer,1.0,Does smokeless tobacco cause cancer?,0.4259749948978424
6_h,health_belief,10468323,"The pathophysiology and effects of antidepressants in the brain are still poorly understood. While it is generally accepted that increasing the levels of monoamine in the brain is an effective way to alleviate depression, the precise neurobiological mechanisms are unclear. The evidence that monoamine function is impaired in individuals with depression is largely indirect. However, the neurotransmitter depletion model allows a more direct investigation of the role of the monoamines. In this model, tryptophan depletion is used to lower levels of serotonin and alpha-methylparatyrosine is used to induce catecholamine depletion in the brain. Studies have shown that such depletion transiently reverses antidepressant responses in the majority of patients, the response being dependent on the type of antidepressant used. However, depletion in unmedicated patients with depression did not worsen the depressive symptoms, neither did it cause depression in healthy subjects with no history of mental illness. The cause(s) of depression therefore appears to be more complex than simply a reduction in levels of monoamine or diminished function in these systems. The pathophysiology of depression may relate to dysfunction in brain areas modulated by monoamine systems.

The recent identification of antidepressant tachyphylaxis, the loss of antidepressant efficacy over time, is only a partial explanation. This is an emerging evidence that, in some individuals, persistent use of antidepressants may be prodepressant. Methods: A literature search of PubMed utilizing the terms: antidepressant tachyphylaxis, treatment-resistant depression, chronic depression, and antidepressant tolerance was performed, and relevant articles were used. Results: Depressed patients who ultimately become treatment resistant frequently have had a positive initial response to antidepressants and invariably have received these agents for prolonged time periods at high doses. Parallels between this course and tardive dyskinesia are noted. It is proposed that neuroplastic processes related to dendritic arborization may underlie the treatment resistant depression that occurs in the setting of chronic antidepressant use. Since the prodepressant effect is seen after prolonged antidepressant use, the term tardive dysphoria is proposed.

Results: When other factors associated with the risk of developing diabetes were controlled, elevated BDI scores at baseline or during the study were not associated with diabetes risk in any arm. Baseline antidepressant use was associated with diabetes risk in the PLB (hazard ratio 2.25 [95% CI 1.38-3.66]) and ILS (3.48 [1.93-6.28]) arms. Continuous antidepressant use during the study (compared with no use) was also associated with diabetes risk in the same arms (PLB 2.60 [1.37-4.94]; ILS 3.39 [1.61-7.13]), as was intermittent antidepressant use during the study in the ILS arm (2.07 [1.18-3.62]). Among MET arm participants, antidepressant use was not associated with developing diabetes. Conclusions: A strong and statistically significant association between antidepressant use and diabetes risk in the PLB and ILS arms was not accounted for by measured confounders or mediators.

6_h,health_belief,10775018,"The monoamine hypothesis of depression predicts that the underlying pathophysiologic basis of depression is a depletion in the levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine in the central nervous system. This hypothesized pathophysiology appears to be supported by the mechanism of action of antidepressants: agents that elevate the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain have all been shown to be effective in the alleviation of depressive symptoms. However, intensive investigation has failed to find convincing evidence of a primary dysfunction of a specific monoamine system in patients with major depressive disorders. Understanding of the etiology of depression has been hampered by the absence of direct measurements of monoamines in humans. However, the monoamine depletion paradigm, which reproduces the clinical syndrome, allows a more direct method for investigating the role of monoamines. Results from such studies show that antidepressant responses are transiently reversed, with the response being dependent on the class of antidepressant. In contrast, monoamine depletion does not worsen symptoms in depressed patients not taking medication, nor does it cause depression in healthy volunteers with no depressive illness. In conclusion, it is clear that antidepressant agents in current use do indeed require intact monoamine systems for their therapeutic effect.

Can antidepressants cause anxiety? If this were so, even if relatively rare, it would have widespread implications because of the broad use of antidepressants. However, antidepressants are widely used as a treatment for anxiety. Therefore, unless suggestive evidence were to emerge to implicate them as a potential exacerbating factor, broad use of antidepressants would likely continue for patients whose depression has improved but whose anxiety has not responded, or worsened. In that context we present 12 patients whose anxiety diminished substantially when antidepressants were tapered off, as reflected in Clinical Global Improvement Scale scores assigned by their respective clinicians. Mean duration of antidepressant taper was 17 weeks (range 0-48), as suggested by limited prior evidence supporting very slow taper rates for this purpose. Alternative treatments for depression were often used for these patients as antidepressants were tapered, particularly lithium and lamotrigine, but none of the alternatives used are generally regarded as having anti-anxiety effects. Patients with bipolar disorder diagnoses, including schizoaffective disorder, were specifically excluded. In many of these cases, other medications that might have anti-anxiety effects (including buspirone, quetiapine, olanzapine, gabapentin, and diphenhydramine) were also tapered off. Results suggest that antidepressants may actually cause anxiety in some patients with unipolar depression. Alternatively, lamotrigine or lithium may have more anti-anxiety effects than generally recognized; or these patients may have had subtle bipolar disorder despite the absence of symptoms meeting formal criteria, supporting the ""bipolar spectrum"" perspective on mood disorder diagnosis. This study is limited by the outcome measure used, which assesses anxiety only indirectly in the context of global improvement. However, in view of the broad implications of the findings, these preliminary observations warrant further consideration.

This paper evaluates the validity and the prevalence of antidepressant-induced rapid cycling. Methods: The literature regarding antidepressant induced rapid cycling is reviewed, focusing on two issues: 1) does antidepressant-induced rapid cycling occur only in patients who become manic or hypomanic on antidepressants; 2) can the apparent shortening of cycle length on antidepressants be attributable simply to the fact that antidepressants alleviate depression and can precipitate mania or hypomania. Results: The suggestion that antidepressants can induce rapid cycling is derived primarily from patients who become manic or hypomanic on antidepressants. The fact that antidepressants alleviate depression and precipitate mania can explain most of the available data, without invoking the poorly defined concept of antidepressant-induced rapid cycling. Conclusions: Bipolar patients who are stable on mood stabilizers, who don't become manic or hypomanic on anti-depressants, can be safely treated with antidepressants without excessive concern about inducing rapid cycling.",Does antidepressant cause depression?,antidepressant causes depression,1.0,Does antidepressant cause depression?,0.0002180509181926027

Volunteers were assigned to one of four experimental conditions in which they were either injected with typhoid vaccine or saline placebo, and then either rested or completed two challenging behavioural tasks.

However, in comparison with the physical intervention the cognitive intervention decreases the period between the intervention and the first recurrence of a sick leave period with 144 days (marginal significant). Conclusion: The illness burden represented by absenteeism is effected in detail but not substantially by the interventions.",Does stress cause sickness?,stress causes sickness,1.0,Does stress cause sickness?,0.5942496657371521
7_h,health_belief,16899245,"Psychosocial stress in the form of maternal deprivation and social isolation during early postnatal life induces persistent alterations in behavioral and physiological mechanisms of adaptation. One consequence may be an increased susceptibility to diseases in later life. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate in domestic piglets the effects of a repeated social isolation (2 h daily from day 3 to day 11 of age) on behavioral, endocrine and immune responses to an endotoxin challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1 day or 45 days after the isolation period. Peripheral LPS administration caused serious sickness behavior (somnolence, shivering, vomiting) and provoked profound increases in circulating tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), ACTH and cortisol concentrations. The prior social isolation treatment enhanced signs of sickness and impaired suckling behavior. Early isolated piglets responded to LPS by an increase of shivering on day 12 and by increased vomiting on day 56 compared to controls. Further, there were considerable delays and reductions of time isolated piglets spent suckling on day 12. The repeated isolation stressor diminished TNF-alpha increases after LPS, whereas stress hormone levels were not significantly affected by isolation treatment. Finally, stronger relationships between signs of sickness and physiological measures were revealed in early isolated piglets. The duration of somnolence in isolated piglets was related to changes of cortisol and TNF-alpha concentrations, and the highest impact on duration of shivering was found for changes in cortisol and corticosteroid binding globulin levels. The present results suggest a sustained adaptive sensitization of coping with infection by social stress experience during early development in piglets.",Does stress cause sickness?,stress causes sickness,1.0,Does stress cause sickness?,0.9556331634521484

Study design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: We conducted a questionnaire study of 1 198 Finnish teachers utilizing the Work Ability Score. Results: The Work Ability Score median was 8 (Q 1 : 7, Q 3 : 9), and 71% (CI 95% 69%-74%) of the subjects reported that they had good work ability. Female teachers had a significantly lower Work Ability Score than male teachers. The median number of days absent due to sickness during the previous year was 4 (Q 1 : 2, Q 3 : 10). Voice disorders (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.44; CI95% 1.73-3.44), stress at work (rather or very much vs. not at all or little; aOR 6.53; CI95% 4.31-9.90), and poor perceived indoor environment quality (aOR 2.63; CI95% 1.86-3.71) were all clear risk factors for the Work Ability Score. Conclusion: We determined that decreased work ability in teachers is connected to voice disorders, stress at work, and poor perceived indoor environment quality. Thus, in order to better maintain teachers' work ability, we recommend that special attention should be paid to occupational health care when there are problems in the indoor environment of teachers, and they suffer from voice disorders and stress.",Does stress cause sickness?,stress causes sickness,1.0,Does stress cause sickness?,0.9166985154151917

Some antipsychotic and antianxiety agents induce alopecia. Hair loss is also related to hypothyroidism, which can be induced by lithium and other agents. Alopecia might not be reported by some people, but physicians should be aware of this potential problem which may contribute to noncompliance. Lithium causes hair loss in 12-19% of long-term users. Valproic acid and/ or divalproex precipitates alopecia in up to 12% of patients in a dose-dependent relationship. Incidences up to 28% are observed with high valproate concentration exposures. These pharmaceuticals also can change hair color and structure. The occurrence of carbamazepine-induced alopecia is at or below 6%. Hair loss is less common with other mood stabilizers. Tricyclic antidepressants, maprotilene, trazodone, and virtually all the new generation of antidepressants may on rare occasions lead to alopecia. The same applies to haloperidol, olanzepine, risperidone, clonazepam, and buspirone, but not to other neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates, selected antihistamines, and antiparkinsonians.

Drug-induced alopecia is usually described as a diffuse non-scarring alopecia which is reversible upon withdrawal of the drug. Only a few drugs (mainly antimitotic agents) routinely cause hair loss whereas many drugs may be the cause of isolated cases of alopecia. Some psychotropic drugs are likely to induce a drug-related alopecia. Case reports with tricyclic antidepressants rarely appear in the literature. It has been reported that 15 per cent of patients taking lithium developed hair thinning. Hair loss is reported secondary to some anticonvulsant agents mainly valproic acid. Among antihypertensive drugs, systemic or topic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists should be considered as possible causes of hair loss. Hair loss from salicylates or nonsteroidal analgesics occurs in a very small percentage of patients. All anticoagulant and antithyroid drugs can produce hair loss. Diffuse hair loss can also be associated with the use of oral contraceptives, while receiving the pill and after stopping the drug. There is a long list of drugs that on occasion have been cited as causing hair loss: cimetidine, retinoids, amphetamines, bromocriptine and levodopa. A few isolated cases have been reported with some hypocholesterolaemic or anti-infectious agents. Diagnosis of drug-induced alopecia remains difficult.

8_h,health_belief,12069639,"Antidepressants are among the most widely prescribed medications in the United States. Adverse cutaneous drug reactions (ACDRs) associated with drugs are common, with possibly higher rates associated with psychotropic medications. While the vast majority of ACDRs are benign and easily treated, serious and life- threatening ACDRs, such as those associated with antidepressants, do rarely occur. ACDRs to antidepressants are diagnosed primarily on the basis of the patient's history. A clinician who is aware of these common and potentially serious adverse events will help avoid their continuation or recurrence. There are certain characteristics that place an individual at higher risk for an ACDR such as female gender, increasing age, African-American ethnicity, use of multiple medications and presence of a serious illness. If a cutaneous reaction occurs in an outpatient setting, it is advisable to discontinue the offending antidepressant and substitute it with one from another class. Treatment of the ACDR should be symptomatic if the patient shows no other significant signs of reaction. If other signs are present, however, a dermatology consultation should be obtained. Since the diagnosis of ACDRs is often tentative, and the exanthema is likely to be benign, the physician treating a patient with a mood or anxiety disorder must weigh the risk of developing these potential problems against the possibility of relapse of the psychiatric disorder should the medication be discontinued.",Does medication cause hair loss?,medication causes hair loss,1.0,Does medication cause hair loss?,0.9987505674362183

To examine the association between milk consumption and acne risk, we conducted a meta-analysis of available data. Materials and methods: We carried out comprehensive databases search of PubMed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane Library and identified four cohort studies and nine case-control or cross-sectional studies, including a total of 71 819 participants. We evaluated the pooled odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random effects model. Subgroup analyses on acne severity, milk forms and milk intake levels were performed. Results: Compared with non-consumers, the pooled OR was 1.16 (95% CI 1.09-1.24) for overall milk consumers in all included studies, and 1.17 (95% CI 1.10-1.24) in cohort studies and 1.16 (95% CI 1.09-1.24) in case-control or cross-sectional studies.

However, it has been shown that it is the loss of microbial diversity in the skin and the imbalance among C. acnes phylotypes that brings about acne rather than the C. acnes species as a whole. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that other microorganisms may be implicated, such as the fungi Malassezia and the bacteria Cutibacterium granulosum. A plethora of scientific evidence suggests that the gut microbiome is implicated in the overall health and physiology of the host; studies show that the gut microbiome of acne patients is distinct and depicts less microbial diversity compared to individuals without acne. Herein, using the key terms: acne, C. acnes, IGF-1, sebum, and gut microbiome, we carried out a review of the literature, using Google Scholar and PubMed, and discussed the role of the gut and skin microbiome in relation to acne, as a narrative review. The role of hormones, diet, sebum, and stress in relation to the gut microbiome was also investigated. Therapeutic implications and the use of pre-/postbiotics are also deliberated upon.

For a long time, people have believed that increasing milk intake is beneficial to increasing bone density. Many confounding factors can affect milk consumption, and thus the association described to date may not be causal. We explored the causal relationship between genetically predicted milk consumption and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) of the femoral neck and lumbar spine based on 53,236 individuals from 27 studies of European ancestry using the Mendelian randomization (MR) study. 32,961 individuals of European and East Asian ancestry were used for sensitivity analysis. Methods: A genetic instrument used for evaluating milk consumption is rs4988235, a locus located at 13,910 base pairs upstream of the LCT gene. A Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to study the effect of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and BMD. The summary-level data for BMD of the femoral neck and lumbar spine were obtained from two GWAS meta-analyses ['Data Release 2012' and 'Data Release 2015' in the GEnetic Factors for OSteoporosis Consortium (GEFOS)]. Results: we found that genetically predicted milk consumption was not associated with FN-BMD(OR 1.007; 95% CI 0.991-1.023; P = 0.385), LS-BMD(OR 1.003; 95% CI 0.983-1.024; P = 0.743) by performing a meta-analysis of several different cohort studies. High levels of genetically predicted milk intake were positively associated with increased FN-BMD in Women. The OR for each additional milk intake increasing allele was 1.032 (95%CI 1.005-1.059; P = 0.014).

A close look at the scientific literature shows a striking contradiction. On the one hand, experimental studies of surrogate markers (e.g., bone turnover markers and bone mineral density [BMD]) usually indicate benefits from drinking cow's milk. On the other, the findings from epidemiological studies are conflicting and disconcerting. In all age groups, including children and postmenopausal women, consuming cow's milk, powdered milk supplements, or whey protein is associated with a slower bone turnover and unchanged or higher BMD values. These benefits are particularly marked in populations where calcium deficiency is prevalent, for instance in Asian countries. No interventional studies have addressed the fracture risk potentially associated with drinking cow's milk. The only available data come from epidemiological observational studies, whose results are conflicting, with a lower fracture risk in some cases and no difference or a higher risk in others. Several hypotheses have been offered to explain these findings, such as a deleterious effect of D-galactose, lactose intolerance, and acid overload. Epidemiological studies face many obstacles when seeking to detect effects of a single food, particularly the multiplicity of interactions among foods. Furthermore, reliable dietary intake data must be collected over prolonged periods, often long before the occurrence of a fracture, and defective recall may therefore introduce a major yet often unrecognized bias, particularly in populations where calcium deficiency is uncommon.

Purpose: We summarized earlier data on the association between milk and dairy intake and risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture through a meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic literature search of relevant reports published in PubMed, ISI (Web of Science), EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar until August 2018 was conducted. Results: Total dairy intake was protectively associated with reduced risk of osteoporosis based on cross-sectional and case-control studies (0.63; 95% CI: 0.55-0.73). Milk consumption was not associated with the risk of osteoporosis (overall RR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.57-1.08). In non-linear dose-response meta-analysis, increase intake of dairy (at the level of 0 to 250 grams per day) was associated with a reduced risk of osteoporosis ( P nonlinearty = 0.005). Meta-regression of included studies revealed an inverse linear association between dairy and milk intake and risk of osteoporosis; such that every additional 200-gram intake of dairy and milk was associated with a 22% and 37% reduced risk of osteoporosis, respectively. In terms of hip fracture, milk consumption was associated with a 25% reduced risk of hip fracture only in cross-sectional and case-control studies (overall RR = 0.75; 95%CI: 0.57-0.99). In linear meta-regression, every additional 200-gram milk intake per day was associated with a 9% greater risk of hip fracture in cohort studies. Conclusion: Despite an inverse association between milk and dairy intake and risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture in cross-sectional and case-control studies, no such association was seen in cohort studies. Given the advantages of the cohort over case-control studies, we concluded that a greater intake of milk and dairy products was not associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture.",Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,0.7718470096588135

Forty 12-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized (OVX), and another nine rats received a sham operation (Sham-Cont). After a 1-week recovery period, the OVX rats were divided into four dietary groups: OVX-control group (OVX-Cont), 17% skimmed milk powder diet group (OVX-Milk), 17% powdered fermented milk diet group (OVX-Yogurt) and 12% whey powder and 6% whey protein extract diet group (OVX-Whey) (n=10 in each group). The protein, nitrogen, fat, calcium and phosphorus contents of the experimental diets were adjusted to be similar to the control diet (AIN-93M). Eighty-four days after the beginning of the experimental diet, the total bone mineral density and bone mineral contents of lumbar vertebrae were significantly higher in the OVX-Milk and OVX-Whey groups than in the OVX-Cont group. Furthermore, the level of 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1alpha, 25(OH)2D3] was significantly lower, while the serum level of FGF23 was significantly higher in the OVX-Milk, OVX-Yogurt and OVX-Whey groups than in the OVX-Cont group. These findings suggest that milk and the dairy products could improve bone metabolism in a postmenopausal animal model at least partly through changing the balance between 1alpha, 25(OH)2D3 and FGF23.",Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,0.773993194103241
10_h,health_belief,19172341,"Current treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis suffer from side effects. Safe and natural milk proteins, ribonuclease, and lactoferrin promote formation of new capillaries and bone formation. A ribonuclease-enriched lactoferrin supplement studied here, demonstrates significant reduction in resorption and increase in formation, towards restoring the balance of bone turnover within 6 months. Introduction: Osteoporosis, a major health issue among postmenopausal women, causes increased bone resorption and reduced bone formation. A reduction in angiogenesis could also contribute to this imbalance. Current treatments such as hormone replacement therapy and bisphosphonates have drawbacks of severe side effects. Milk ribonuclease (RNase) is known to promote angiogenesis and lactoferrin (LF) to stimulate bone formation by osteoblasts. We examine the effect of ribonuclease-enriched lactoferrin supplement on the bone health of postmenopausal women. Methods: A total of 38 healthy, postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 60 years were randomized into placebo or RNAse-enriched-LF (R-ELF) supplement groups. The bone health status was monitored by assessing bone resorption markers, serum N-telopeptides (NTx), and urine deoxypyridinoline (Dpd) crosslinks and serum bone formation markers, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and osteocalcin (OC). Results: R-ELF supplementation demonstrated a decrease in urine Dpd levels by 14% (19% increase for placebo) and serum NTx maintained at 24% of the baseline (41% for placebo), while serum BAP and OC levels showed a 45% and 16% elevation (25% and 5% for placebo).

Additionally, it is estimated that 0.3 million and 1.7 million people have hip fractures in the USA and Europe, respectively. Having a proper peak bone mass and keeping it as long as possible is especially important for osteoporosis prevention. One of the most important calcium sources is milk and dairy products. Breast milk is the best infant food, but milk should not be avoided later in life to prevent losing bone mass. On the other hand, more and more people limit their milk consumption and consume other dairy or non-dairy products. For example, they are usually replaced with plant beverages, which should be consumed carefully in several age groups. Additionally, an important element of milk and dairy products, as well as plant beverages, are probiotics and prebiotics, which may modulate bone turnover.

10_h,health_belief,33072800,"Increasing peak bone mass during adolescence and reducing bone loss in later life are two approaches to reduce the risk of osteoporosis with aging. Osteoporosis affects a large proportion of the elderly population worldwide and the incidence is increasing. Milk consumption is an accepted strategy in building peak bone mass and therefore may reduce the risk of osteoporosis. In childhood calcium, phosphorous, and growth factors are the important components to support bone growth but in adults the positive influence on bone density/maintenance may also be due to other bioactive proteins/peptides or lipids in milk acting directly in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Lactose has been known to increase calcium absorption; galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are derived from lactose and are non-digestible oligosaccharides. They have been shown to improve mineral balance and bone properties as well as causing increases in bifidobacteria in the gut, therefore a prebiotic effect. Supplementation with fortified milk and dairy products with added prebiotics, increased both calcium and magnesium absorption and caused some modulation of gut microbiota in animals and humans. Fermented milk is now also recognized to contain highly active components such as vitamins, peptides, oligosaccharides, and organic acids. In this review, the role of milk and milk components in improving calcium absorption and thereby supporting bone health is discussed. In addition, some reference is made to the significance of combining the inherent beneficial components from milk with fortificants/nutrients that will support bone health through adulthood.

The aim of this study was to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) and the frequency of osteopenia and osteoporosis in patients with IBD. We also investigated the correlation between BMD and consumption of milk and DPs, as well as with calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] serum concentration levels. Methods: The study comprised 208 patients with IBD. Densitometric measurements were performed using the dual-energy x-ray absorpiometry. Before (IBD-I) and after the diagnosis (IBD-II) of IBD, we used a questionnaire to assess the consumption of milk and DPs. Serum concentrations of PTH, 25(OH)D, calcium, and phosphate were determined. Results: The prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in the IBD patient group was 48.1%. At the same time, 87% of patients with IBD reported milk consumption. Patients from this group with proper bone mass amounted to 91.7%, whereas patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis comprised 82% (P = 0.0382) of patients. In patients with IBD who consumed milk, femoral neck BMD (0.97 ± 0.17 g/cm<sup>2</sup>) was higher than in those not drinking milk (0.897 ± 0.154 g/cm<sup>2</sup>; P = 0.0587). The percentage of patients with IBD consuming DPs was 96.2%; however, this number decreased after diagnosis and was equal to IBD-II: 83% (P 0.0001). Additionally, concentration levels of 25(OH)D decreased in the IBD group (21.82 ± 10.82 ng/dL). Conclusion: Not only does IBD entail a high prevalence of osteoporosis, but BMD values are also indirectly affected by the fact that patient consumption of milk and other DPs decreases after diagnosis.",Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,0.6393340826034546

To determine whether milk consumption influences Ca/bone metabolism in the Ca-deficient population, relationships between milk consumption and serum alkaline phosphatase (Al-P) activity were analyzed in 3,098 premenopausal and 1,182 postmenopausal women and 13,141 men aged 30 to 69 years. Milk consumption was classified into no/yes groups by a self-administered questionnaire that asked ""Do you drink a glass of milk (180 to 200 mL) or more everyday?"". Regardless of age or sex, the ""yes"" group had a lower activity of serum Al-P than the ""no"" group. Milk consumption decreased the activity to a greater degree in women, especially perimenopausal/postmenopausal women, than in men. These results were confirmed in a multivariate analysis considering age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking and drinking habits as confounding factors. Although menopause obviously increased serum Al-P activity in perimenopausal women, it could not influence the effects of milk consumption on the activity. These results suggest that milk has osteostatic effects on humans via a mechanism different from that of estrogens. Milk consumption, even one glass per day, may be an easy and effective strategy for prevention of osteoporosis in the Ca-deficient population, especially perimenopausal/postmenopausal women.",Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,0.8183993697166443

Polyp fluid was found to increase ciliary beat frequency. Histamine and PGD2 had no effect, but PGE2 and PGF2 alpha both increased ciliary beat frequency and so may cause the ciliostimulatory effect of polyp fluid.

We herein investigated expressions of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), TGM2, PPARγ and isopeptide bonds, a reaction product of TGM, in non-CF nasal polyps. Methods: Nasal polyps and inferior turbinates were collected from chronic rhinosinusitis patients without CF during transnasal endoscopic sinonasal surgery. Expressions of CFTR, TGM2, isopeptide bonds and PPARγ were examined by fluorescence immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of CFTR was also analyzed by Western blot. Results: Immunohistochemical fluorescence of the nasal polyp was significantly lower for CFTR and PPARγ, and significantly higher for TGM2 and isopeptide bonds than that of the turbinate mucosa. Lower expression of CFTR in the nasal polyp than in the turbinate mucosa was also observed in Western blot. Expression of PPARG mRNA was significantly lower in the nasal polyp than in the turbinate mucosa, whereas expressions of CFTR mRNA or TGM2 mRNA did not differ between the two tissues. Immunohistochemical fluorescence for CFTR showed significant negative correlation with that for TGM2 and isopeptide bonds, and significant positive correlation with that for PPARγ. The fluorescence for TGM2 was positively correlated with that for isopeptide bonds and negatively correlated with that for PPARγ. The fluorescence for isopeptide bonds tended to be negatively correlated with that for PPARγ. Conclusions: These results suggest a possible role of the CFTR-TGM2-PPARγ cascade in the pathogenesis of nasal polyp formation in non-CF patients as in CF patients.",Does nasal polyp cause nasal block?,nasal polyp causes nasal block,1.0,Does nasal polyp cause nasal block?,0.9590193033218384

Elevated antibody levels have been associated with disease severity in nasal polyps, but upstream drivers of local antibody production in nasal polyps are undetermined. Objective: We sought to identify upstream drivers and phenotypic properties of local antibody-expressing cells in nasal polyps from subjects with AERD. Methods: Sinus tissue was obtained from subjects with AERD, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), CRS without nasal polyps, and controls without CRS. Tissue antibody levels were quantified via ELISA and immunohistochemistry and were correlated with disease severity. Antibody-expressing cells were profiled with single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence, with IL-5Rα function determined through IL-5 stimulation and subsequent RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR. Results: Tissue IgE and IgG4 levels were elevated in AERD compared with in controls (P .01 for IgE and P .001 for IgG4 vs CRSwNP). Subjects with AERD whose nasal polyps recurred rapidly had higher IgE levels than did subjects with AERD, with slower regrowth (P = .005). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed increased IL5RA, IGHG4, and IGHE in antibody-expressing cells from patients with AERD compared with antibody-expressing cells from patients with CRSwNP. There were more IL-5Rα<sup>+</sup> plasma cells in the polyp tissue from those with AERD than in polyp tissue from those with CRSwNP (P = .026). IL-5 stimulation of plasma cells in vitro induced changes in a distinct set of transcripts. Conclusions: Our study identifies an increase in antibody-expressing cells in AERD defined by transcript enrichment of IL5RA and IGHG4 or IGHE, with confirmed surface expression of IL-5Rα and functional IL-5 signaling. Tissue IgE and IgG4 levels are elevated in AERD, and higher IgE levels are associated with faster nasal polyp regrowth.

Methods: Databases of scientific literature were searched between January 1980 and February 2016 to identify publications on the follow-up of ectatic and aneurysmal CIAs after open or endovascular AAA repair. The primary outcome measure was the increase of iliac artery diameter during follow-up. The secondary outcome was the subsequent reintervention rate during follow-up. Results: Only 3 open AAA and 3 EVAR studies containing 1239 patients met the inclusion criteria for analysis. In the open AAA group, ectatic iliac arteries (defined as 12-18 mm) had a diameter progression of 1.7 to 1.8 mm during a follow-up period of 51.6 to 85.2 months. The aneurysmal iliac arteries (&gt;18 mm) in the open repair group showed a faster growth (2.3-3.0 mm) in a follow-up period of 50.4 to 85.2 months. The pooled assessment of arteries ≥18 mm had a mean growth of 2.56 mm at 60 months of follow-up. In the entire open AAA cohort, the reintervention rate for CIA transformation was 1%.

The BBT appeared as a risk factor for type 1b endoleak (OR: 7.13; 95% CI: 1.58-3.04; p .001). Conclusion: The BBT is associated with an increase in CIA volume post-operatively and consequently can be considered a risk factor for type 1b endoleak.

Its chemical structure is significantly different from sildenafil, and in vitro studies confirm significant potency for PDE5 inhibition, with little activity against most of the other isoforms of the enzyme including PDE6, which is the isoform of the enzyme found within the retina. The half-life of tadalafil is 17.5 hours and clinical studies suggest significant activity 24 hours post-dosing. As with sildenafil, efficacy depends upon a normal sexual stimulus, and the drug can taken be as required.

Counterfeit medical products can represent health issues for the user and cause medical mistrust. Within this work, genuine Cialis containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) tadalafil, its generics available in the Czech Republic and the Cialis tablets from questionable online pharmacies were analysed. The methods of infra-red and Raman spectroscopy were used for the identification of the counterfeit tablets and for the verification of their API and excipients. All 9 tablets from online pharmacies were counterfeit with 2 of them even containing a different API (sildenafil, vardenafil). In addition, Raman mapping was used to determine the API and excipients' distribution and, in combination with multivariate data analysis, to separate similar tablets in clusters and to identify the outliers. Scanning electron microscopy of the samples revealed that the process of a wet granulation of micronized API was used during the formulation of the tablets.

13_h,health_belief,34663416,"Background: Although Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) affects the connective tissue causing extremely brittle bones with consequent skeletal deformities, it is important to go beyond bones. Indeed, the quality of life in OI does not only depend on bones status, as OI might affect also other important functions. We have therefore implemented a multidisciplinary study to assess lung function, breathing pattern, sleep quality and nutritional status in 27 adult OI type III and IV patients (median age: 34.6 years; 19 women; 14 type III). Results: According to nocturnal oxygen desaturation, two groups were identified: 13 patients with (OI_OSA, incidence: 48.2%) and 14 without (no_OSA) obstructive sleep apnea. The former was characterized by higher spinal and ribcage deformity, by more restrictive lung function, by paradoxical thoracic breathing in supine position, by rapid and shallow breathing, by higher body mass index, by longer neck and waist circumferences; by higher abdominal volume and by greater percentage of body fat mass, particularly localized in the trunk. The best predictor of OI_OSA was the negative value of the supine ribcage contribution to tidal volume, followed by the ratio between the neck and the waist circumferences with body height and the supine thoraco-abdominal volumes phase shift angle. Conclusions: The pathophysiology of OI ensued a dangerous vicious circle, in which breathing, sleep and nutritional status are tightly linked, and they might all end up in negatively affecting the quality of life. The vicious circle is fed by some intrinsic characteristics of the disease (thoracic, cranial and mandibular deformities) and some bad daily habits of the patients (i.e. physical inactivity and low dietary quality). The former impacts on restricting the respiratory function, the latter makes Olers more prone to experience overweight or obesity. The main consequence is a high incidence of obstructive sleep apnea, which remains an underdiagnosed disorder in individuals with severe OI who are obese, with a neck to height ratio over than 31.6%, and characterized by paradoxical breathing in supine position. A multidisciplinary approach, including evaluations of breathing, sleep and nutrition, is required to better manage the disease and fulfil the maximizing well-being of OI patients.",Does diet cause bad breathe?,diet causes bad breathe,1.0,Does diet cause bad breathe?,0.6573508381843567

To our knowledge, there has never been an overfeeding study comparing the effects of multiple diets. Recent findings: This study reports a case study of an individual who ate 5800 Calories per day of 3 different diets for 21 days at a time. The 3 different diets were low-carb, low-fat, and very-low-fat vegan. The weight gain over 21 days was 1.3 kg for low-carb, 7.1 kg for low-fat, and 4.7 kg for very-low-fat vegan. Summary: In this n-of-1 study, consuming 5800 Calories/day of 3 different diets for 21 days did not lead to the same amount of weight gain. Further research should be conducted on how the human body gains weight with an emphasis on how different foods affect physiology.

In this study, we explored the perspectives of community-dwelling older adults as they struggled to balance dysphagia symptoms and recommended diet modifications with their preferred lifestyles. Design and methods: Using an interpretive descriptive design, we conducted 37 in-home semi-structured interviews and 5 member-checking interviews, participant observations during a meal, and reviewed the medical charts of 20 participants recruited through maximum variation purposeful sampling. Meaning units and codes were identified and synthesized into 4 themes. Results: Participants faced a frightening choice between eating and breathing. Hiding dysphagia symptoms from the public eye was important to preserve self-identity. Following the recommended diet created a feeling that life was ""falling apart."" We also found that adhering to the diet was not an ""all or none"" phenomenon.

13_h,health_belief,22222301,"Background: Patients undergoing bariatric surgery often complain of bad breath. However, the relationship between bariatric surgery and halitosis is relatively unknown. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the occurrence of halitosis among patients before and after a specific type of bariatric surgery, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and its relationship with the tongue coating index, plaque index, and salivary flow rate. Methods: A total of 62 patients with good oral health and in treatment for obesity at the walk-in clinic of Santa Casa Hospital, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, were selected. Of this sample, 31 were bariatric surgery candidates (control group) and 31 had already undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (case group). After completing a questionnaire, all patients underwent an oral clinical examination. Halitosis was measured using an organoleptic scale and a portable sulfide monitor. Results: The Spearman correlation demonstrated a strong positive relation between the organoleptic rates and the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds determined using the sulfide monitor (rs = .58; P = .0001). No difference was found in the prevalence of halitosis between the 2 groups (P = .48). Only the salivary flow rate was significantly reduced in the control group compared with the case group (P = .02). In the case group, the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds correlated negatively with the salivary flow rate (P = .04) and positively with the tongue coating index (P = .005). The tongue coating index was significantly increased in those patients who did not brush the tongue (P .04) and who had had episodes of vomiting (P = .02). Conclusion: These data suggest that no significant association exists between halitosis and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

13_h,health_belief,30177382,"Aquatic areas frequently face hypoxic conditions. In order to get sufficient oxygen to support aerobic metabolism, a number of freshwater fish resort to aerial respiration to supplement gill respiration especially in situations with reduced oxygen availability in the water. In many species a concomitant reduction in gill surface area or in gill perfusion reduces possible loss of aerially acquired oxygen to the water at the gills, but it also compromises the ion regulatory capacity of gill tissue. In consequence, the reduced gill contact area with water requires appropriate compensation to maintain ion and acid-base homeostasis, often with important ramifications for other organs. Associated modifications in the structure and function of the gills themselves, the skin, the gut, the kidney, and the physiology of water exchange and ion-linked acid-base regulation are discussed. In air-breathing fish, the gut may gain particular importance for the uptake of ions. In addition, tissues frequently exposed to environmental air encounter much higher oxygen partial pressures than typically observed in fish tissues. Physostomous fish using the swimbladder for aerial respiration, for example, will encounter aerial oxygen partial pressure at the swimbladder epithelium when frequently gulping air in hypoxic water. Hyperoxic conditions or rapid changes in oxygen partial pressures result in an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accordingly, in air-breathing fish, strategies of ionoregulation may be greatly modified, and the ROS defense capacity of air-exposed tissues is improved.",Does diet cause bad breathe?,diet causes bad breathe,1.0,Does diet cause bad breathe?,0.3722436726093292
13_h,health_belief,21219516,"Aims: To measure adherence levels with dietary restrictions in Irish patients with end-stage renal disease receiving haemodialysis and to explore the relationships between adherence with dietary sodium restrictions and health beliefs in relation to following these restrictions in this group. Background: Non-adherence to medical regimes is an important healthcare issue and an ever-present problem, particularly in patients with a chronic illness. The literature revealed a lack of studies measuring adherence with the sodium component of the renal dietary restrictions and associated factors; despite the fact that adherence with sodium restrictions is essential to the optimal management of end-stage renal disease. Furthermore, despite increased emphasis on 'the patients' view' in healthcare no study to date has contextualised health beliefs and adherence in end-stage renal disease from an Irish perspective. Design: A quantitative, descriptive, correlational design was employed using the Health Belief Model as a theoretical framework. Methods: A convenience sample (n = 79) was recruited from the haemodialysis units of a large hospital. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires. Data were analysed using descriptive and correlational statistics. Results: Non-adherence with dietary restrictions was a problem among a proportion of the sample. Greater adherence levels with dietary sodium restrictions were associated with greater 'perceived benefits' and fewer 'perceived barriers.' Conclusion: For the Irish patient, beliefs in relation to following a low sodium diet significantly affected adherence levels with this diet. This is an important finding as delineating key beliefs, particularly key barriers, facilitates an increased understanding of non-adherence for nurses. Relevance for clinical practice: These findings have implications for the care of patients with end-stage renal disease in that they can provide guidance in terms of developing interventions designed to improve adherence.",Does diet cause bad breathe?,diet causes bad breathe,1.0,Does diet cause bad breathe?,0.2161616086959839

It often creates serious personal and social embarrassment for the afflicted individual. Therefore, a dentist must be able to diagnose the etiology of halitosis and treat it or refer an individual to a specialist. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of halitosis and the effect of a peppermint mouth rinse on it. Materials and methods: This study was performed in two steps. At the first step, in a cross-sectional study, 504 students who were 14-18 years old were examined to define the students who suffered from halitosis, and then at the second step, the selected 84 students with halitosis were divided into two groups randomly. A total of 43 students in group 1 received a peppermint mouth rinse and 41 students in another group were given placebo. The students in two groups washed their mouth with 15-20 ml of the given solutions three times in a 1-week period (after breakfast, after lunch or on returning to home, before sleeping) and didn't eat anything for 30 min after rinsing. After 1 week, the students were examined again. Results: The prevalence of halitosis was 24.4% totally. In the mouth rinse group, after 1 week 23 students didn't exhibit halitosis, and 11 students in the placebo group were halitosis positive. A chi-square test showed that this difference was significant.

However, pregnant women who get infected with Listeria may experience only mild symptoms, making the diagnosis difficult, even when the fetus is fatally infected. Methods: To reveal features of this infection, we conducted a multimodality imaging study of Listeria-induced miscarriage, using a pregnant mouse model. In this model, fetal morbidity and mortality can be observed in utero, noninvasively, and the timing and extent of infection can be carefully controlled. By employing in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI), perinatal infections were localized over time such that a correlation of infection to outcome could be determined without the need to kill the animal subject. The morbidity and viability of fetuses were assessed with ultrasound, and fetal morphology was imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: The ultrasound revealed sustained fetal bradycardia, the slowing of the fetal heartbeat, in infected fetuses, with an association between slowed fetal heart rate and strong bioluminescent signal. Discussion: Uninfected fetuses showing no bioluminescent signal in the same uterine horn exhibited normal heartbeats. Thus, fetal bradycardia during infection was localized to the infected fetus and was not systemic or disseminated.",Does listeria cause miscarriage?,listeria causes miscarriage,1.0,Does listeria cause miscarriage?,0.8898006677627563
