1,2019,23396043,"Despite considerable controversy about their effects, cranberries in various forms have been used widely for several decades to prevent as well as treat urinary tract infections (UTIs). The purpose of this article is to present a review of research-based information regarding the ability of cranberries to prevent UTIs in adults at risk for UTIs. Current evidence suggests that cranberries decrease bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells and thus decrease the incidence of UTIs without adverse effects in most individuals. Thus clinicians may safely advise patients that cranberries are helpful in preventing UTIs. Cranberries may be a viable adjunct to antibiotics for patients with repeated UTIs.",Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,0.9168699979782104
1,2019,22760907,"Lower urinary tract infections are very common diseases. Recurrent urinary tract infections remain challenging to treat because the main treatment option is long-term antibiotic prophylaxis; however, this poses a risk for the emergence of bacterial resistance. Some options to avoid this risk are available, including the use of cranberry products.

1,2019,28288837,"Purpose: We sought to clarify the association between cranberry intake and the prevention of urinary tract infections. Materials and methods: This systematic review, which complies with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) statement, was done as a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of clinical trials. Results: The findings clearly showed the potential use of cranberries for the clinical condition of urinary tract infection. Cranberry products significantly reduced the incidence of urinary tract infections as indicated by the weighted risk ratio (0.6750, 95% CI 0.5516-0.7965, p 0.0001). The results of subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients at some risk for urinary tract infections were more susceptible to the effects of cranberry ingestion. Conclusions: The results of the current study could be used by physicians to recommend cranberry ingestion to decrease the incidence of urinary tract infections, particularly in individuals with recurrent urinary tract infections. This would also reduce the administration of antibiotics, which could be beneficial since antibiotics can lead to the worldwide emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms.",Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,0.9362148642539978
1,2019,16329274,"Cranberries are widely used in the treatment and prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and for those at risk of such infections. With the growing resistance to antibiotics, cranberries can be viewed as a useful non-pharmaceutical remedy (Lavender, 2000). The initial studies that looked at the effects of cranberries on urine showed that the excretion of hippuric acid from the berries helped the urine to remain acidic, which could explain why they could be used to treat and prevent infection (Harkin, 2000). Recent studies argue that cranberries prevent Escherichia coli (E. coli) from adhering to uroepithelial cells in the bladder (Howell and Foxman, 2002). Cranberries contain a group of compounds, called proanthocyanidins, which are condensed tannins (Gray, 2002; Lowe and Fagelman, 2001; Kuzminski, 1996). These are thought to be the key factors in inhibiting E. coli adherence.",Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,0.7695390582084656
1,2019,19219097,"Background: Cranberries have been used for prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections for decades. The berries contain proanthocyanidins that may reduce the susceptibility to infection by preventing bacteria from attaching to uroepithelial cells. Several clinical trials have been published during recent years. This article reviews documentation of cranberries on clinical effect, adverse events, drug interactions and use during pregnancy and lactation. Material and methods: Clinical effects of cranberries have been assessed based on the Cochrane review from January 2007 and literature on clinical trials retrieved from a systematic search of PubMed and Embase (from 1 January 2007 to 29 October 2008) with the search terms ""cranberry"", ""Vaccinium macrocarpon"", ""Vaccinium oxycoccus"". Results and interpretation: Some evidence exists on cranberries' preventive effect on recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections in women. The evidence is inconclusive for children, men and older people (both men and women). Studies of people with neuropathic bladder are contradictory. Most of the clinical trials published have several flaws and have not used standardised products. More evidence is needed to determine the optimum dosage, method of administration and the minimum length of treatment.

1,2019,10796775,"Background: Cranberries (particularly in the form of cranberry juice) have been used widely for several decades for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections. The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of cranberries in treating such infections. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of cranberries for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Search strategy: The search strategy developed by the Cochrane Renal Group was used. Also, companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations were contacted; electronic databases and the Internet were searched using English and non English language terms; reference lists of review articles and relevant trials were also searched. Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi randomised controlled trials of cranberry juice or cranberry products for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Trials of men, women or children were included. Data collection and analysis: Titles and abstracts of studies that were potentially relevant to the review were screened by one reviewer, RJ, who discarded studies that were clearly ineligible but aimed to be overly inclusive rather than risk losing relevant studies. Reviewers RJ and LM independently assessed whether the studies met the inclusion criteria. Further information was sought from the authors where papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility. Main results: No trials were found which fulfilled all of the inclusion criteria. Two trials were excluded because they did not have any relevant outcomes. Reviewer's conclusions: After a thorough search, no randomised trials which assessed the effectiveness of cranberry juice for the treatment of urinary tract infections were found. Therefore, at the present time, there is no good quality evidence to suggest that it is effective for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Well-designed parallel group, double blind trials comparing cranberry juice and other cranberry products versus placebo to assess the effectiveness of cranberry juice in treating urinary tract infections are needed. Outcomes should include reduction in symptoms, sterilisation of the urine, side effects and adherence to therapy. Dosage (amount and concentration) and duration of therapy should also be assessed.

1,2019,19636526,"Recurrent urinary tract infections are a frequent problem in urological practice. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis can cause resistance of some intestinal bacteria, and after therapy is stopped, infections often resume. In controlled studies, general recommendations for prophylaxis were shown to inhibit reinfection. One of these recommendations is the consumption of cranberries. A review of the literature in PubMed as well as the recently published Cochrane database systematic review confirmed that daily consumption of cranberries prevents recurrent urinary tract infections. In vitro studies have shown that binding of the P fimbriae of Escherichia coli to the uroepithelial tissue can be inhibited in the presence of proanthocyanidins, the active ingredient of cranberries. In clinical studies, the evidence is not so pronounced. Many other bacteria have fimbriae, but only a few subpopulations have P fimbriae. P fimbriae are frequent in E. coli, so this adhesion can be prevented.

3,2019,28664077,"Acupuncture is an ancient therapeutic intervention that can be traced back at least 2100 years and is emerging worldwide as one of the most widely used therapies in the field of complementary and alternative medicine. Due to limitations associated with Western medicine's focus on the treatment of diseases rather than on their causes, interests are shifting to complementary and alternative medicines. The Acupuncture and Meridian Science Research Center (AMSRC) was established in 2005 to elucidate the neurophysiological mechanisms of acupuncture for neurological diseases based on multidisciplinary research supported by the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology. In the AMSRC, resultant research articles have shown that acupuncture can improve neurological and psychological problems, including Parkinson's disease, pain, and depression, in animal models. Basic research studies suggest its effectiveness in treating various problems such as depression, drug addiction, epilepsy, ischemia, dementia, Parkinson's disease, and pain.

3,2019,23589718,"The efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) on epilepsy remains to be verified because of previous controversies that might be due to the complexity of the effects induced by different acupoints and stimulation approaches adopted. Therefore, we investigated the effects of EA on epilepsy to determine the specific acupoints and optimal stimulation parameters in this work. Experimental epilepsy was induced by injecting kainic acid to the lateral cerebral ventricle of adult male SD rats. EA with a low-frequency (10 Hz/1 mA) or high-frequency (100 Hz/1 mA) current was applied to the epileptic model for 30 minutes starting at 0.5 hour after the injection. Four pairs of acupoints were tested, that is, Shuigou (DU26) + Dazhui (DU14), Jinsuo (DU8) + Yaoqi (EXB9), Neiguan (PC6) + Quchi (LI11), and Fenglong (ST40) + Yongquan (KI1). We found that (1) low- or high-frequency EA at different acupoints reduced epileptic seizures (P 0.05 versus the control) with an exception of low-frequency EA at Neiguan (PC6) and Quchi (LI11); (2) low-frequency EA induced a better effect at Fenglong (ST40) plus Yongquan (KI1) than that of the other acupoints (P 0.05); (3) there is no significant difference in the effects of high-frequency EA at these acupoints; and (4) the high-frequency EA elicited a greater effect than that of low-frequency EA in all groups (P 0.05), with an exception at Jinsuo (DU8) + Yaoqi (EXB9). The EA-induced attenuation appeared 1-1.5 hours after EA with no appreciable effect in the first hour after EA in either the EEG or the behavioral tests. We conclude that EA attenuation of epileptic seizures is dependent on the stimulation parameters and acupoints and that the delay in appearance of the EA effect could be a reflection of the time required by the EA signal to regulate neural function in the central nervous system.",Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,0.941037654876709
3,2019,16625622,"Background: Seizures are poorly controlled in many people with epilepsy despite adequate current antiepileptic treatments. There is increasing interest in alternative therapies such as acupuncture; however, it remains unclear whether the existing evidence is rigorous enough to support the use of acupuncture. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people with epilepsy. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (June 2005) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005). We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, TCMLARS, China Biological Medicine Database, Chinese Acupuncture Trials Register, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database from inception to June 2005. Reference lists from relevant trials were reviewed. No language restrictions were imposed. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture involving people of any age with any type of epilepsy were included. Trials included were those comparing acupuncture with placebo, sham or no treatment; or comparing acupuncture plus other treatments with the same other treatments. Trials that only compared different acupuncture methods or compared acupuncture alone with other treatments were excluded. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted trial data and assessed trial quality using the Jadad score. Relative risk (RR) was used for binary data and weighted mean difference for continuous data, and 95% confidence intervals are given. Where possible, analyses were by intention to treat. Main results: Three small trials of varying methodological quality and with short follow up met the inclusion criteria. Two studied children in China and one studied adults in Norway. The two Chinese studies compared acupuncture plus Chinese herbs with Chinese herbs alone while the Norwegian study compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture. The two Chinese studies found that more children treated with acupuncture achieved 75% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.05) and seizure duration (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.13 to 5) with a significant 50% or greater reduction in seizure duration (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.73). However, the two trials were of low quality without adequate description of randomisation method, concealment of randomisation or blinding. On the other hand, the higher quality Norwegian trial found that acupuncture did not improve the mean seizure frequency, seizure-free weeks, or quality of life in adults.

Methods: The Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31) and the initial and final seizure frequency of 26 adult patients with TLE-HS who underwent acupuncture sessions for 10 consecutive weeks were assessed. The data were compared to those of 26 patients with TLE-HS not submitted to acupuncture, with p 0.05. Results: There was a clinically significant effect in reducing the mean number of seizures per month in the follow-up period of patients submitted or not to acupuncture (no intervention group and intervention group, effect size: -0.94 and -1.01, respectively). In the last four weeks of follow-up, there was a significant difference between the no intervention and intervention groups (0.5 [0-2] and 0 [0-4]; p = 0.018). When using minimally important change (MIC) threshold data for the QOLIE-31 between the final and initial scores, with the Cantril Ladder Scale as anchoring, it was observed that, in the intervention group, large clinically significant effects were seen for all dimensions, except for cognitive function, medication effect, and social function, which presented medium effects. In the follow-up, the variation of the QOLIE-31 scores was positive for both groups; however, it was higher in all dimensions in the intervention group, indicating a better QOL. Conclusion: There was a reduction in the mean number of seizures per month in all patients during the follow-up period. Acupuncture significantly reduced the number of seizures in the intervention group in the final phase of the study.

Setting: This study was based on Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database that included information on stroke patients hospitalised between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2004. Participants: We identified 42 040 patients hospitalised with newly diagnosed stroke who were aged 20 years and above. Primary and secondary outcome measures: We compared incident epilepsy during the follow-up period until the end of 2009 in stroke patients who were and were not receiving acupuncture. The adjusted HRs and 95% CIs of epilepsy associated with acupuncture were calculated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression. Results: Stroke patients who received acupuncture treatment (9.8 per 1000 person-years) experienced a reduced incidence of epilepsy compared to those who did not receive acupuncture treatment (11.5 per 1000 person-years), with an HR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.80) after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and coexisting medical conditions. Acupuncture treatment was associated with a decreased risk of epilepsy, particularly among stroke patients aged 20-69 years. The log-rank test probability curve indicated that stroke patients receiving acupuncture treatment had a reduced probability of epilepsy compared with individuals who did not receive acupuncture treatment during the follow-up period (p 0.0001). Conclusions: Stroke patients who received acupuncture treatment had a reduced risk of epilepsy compared with those not receiving acupuncture treatment.

To do so, we searched PubMed in March 2013 for studies investigating cerebral hemodynamics with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound, and other tools in migraineurs, acupuncture recipients, and migraineurs receiving acupuncture. Our search identified 1321 distinct articles - acupuncture (n = 463), migraine (n = 866), and both (n = 8). Only three (n = 3) satisfied our inclusion criteria.

(2) TCD can detect pretreatment differences between responders and non-responders to acupuncture, which may be predictive of clinical response. (3) ""Point-through-point"" needling (at angles connecting acupoints) may be clinically superior to standard acupuncture, thus needling angles may affect treatment effectiveness. None of the reviewed articles investigated patient responses during migraine attack.

5,2019,34093119,"Background: Migraine is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by attacks of moderate or severe headache and various neurological symptoms. Migraine is typically treated by pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies to relieve pain or prevent migraine attacks. Pharmacological therapies show limited efficacy in relieving headache and are often accompanied by adverse effects, while the benefits of acupuncture, a non-pharmacological therapy, have been well-documented in both the treatment and prevention of acute migraine attacks. However, the underlying mechanism of the effect of acupuncture on relieving migraine remains unclear. Recent advances in neuroimaging technology have offered new opportunities to explore the underlying neural mechanism of acupuncture in treating migraine. To pave the way for future research, this review provides an overview neuroimaging studies on the use of acupuncture for migraine in the last 10 years.

The analyses used included the regional homogeneity (ReHo) method (n = 3), amplitude of low frequency (ALFF) method ( n = 2), independent component analysis (ICA; n = 3), seed-based analysis (SBA; n = 1), both ICA and SBA ( n = 1), Pearson's correlation to calculate functional connectivity (FC) between brain regions ( n = 1), and a machine learning method ( n = 1). Five studies focused on the instant effect of acupuncture, and the research objects were those with acute migraine ( n = 2) and migraine in the interictal phase ( n = 3). Ten studies focused on the lasting effect of acupuncture, and all the studies selected migraine patients in the interictal phase. This review included five task-based studies and 10 resting-state studies. None of the studies conducted a correlation analysis between functional brain changes and instant clinical efficacy. For studies that performed a correlation analysis between functional brain changes and sustained clinical efficacy, the prophylactic effect of acupuncture on migraine might be through regulation of the visual network, default mode network (DMN), sensory motor network, frontoparietal network (FPN), limbic system, and/or descending pain modulatory system (DPMS). Conclusion: The neural mechanism underlying the immediate effect of acupuncture analgesia remains unclear, and the neural mechanism of sustained acupuncture treatment for migraine might be related to the regulation of pain-related brain networks. The experimental design of neuroimaging studies that examined the effect of acupuncture in migraine also have some shortcomings, and it is necessary to standardize and optimize the experimental design. Multi-center neuroimaging studies are needed to provide a better insight into the neural mechanism underlying the effect of acupuncture on migraine. Multi-modality neuroimaging studies that integrate multiple data analysis methods are required for cross-validation of the neuroimaging results. In addition, applying machine learning methods in neuroimaging studies can help to predict acupuncture efficacy and screen for migraineurs for whom acupuncture treatment would be suitable.",Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,0.9774813652038574
5,2019,35145793,"Migraine is a debilitating condition that places a substantial economic burden on society and seriously affects patients' quality of life. Currently, there is no known ""cure"" for migraines, and pharmacologic treatments or prophylaxis carry many unwanted effects. Acupuncture has been accepted as an alternative treatment. However, its effectiveness is still debated. This is a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCT) that investigate acupuncture safety and efficacy in migraine versus various control groups. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Cochrane library using keywords: migraines, migraine with aura, migraine without aura, headache, acupuncture, and needling therapy. Two independent reviewers participated in data extraction and assessment. Fifteen randomized controlled trials involving 2,056 participants that met the inclusion criteria were obtained and analyzed. Based on the findings, seven out of 10 trials that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture showed a more significant reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks and headache intensity. Four studies revealed acupuncture is just as effective and has fewer side effects than any western medicine. Acupuncture can be recommended as an alternative or adjunct to drug treatment for patients suffering migraines. However, further clinical trials that utilized the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) recommendation are still needed to strongly present an evidence-based strategy.",Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,0.9813458323478699
5,2019,22231691,"Background: Acupuncture is commonly used to treat migraine. We assessed the efficacy of acupuncture at migraine-specific acupuncture points compared with other acupuncture points and sham acupuncture. Methods: We performed a multicentre, single-blind randomized controlled trial. In total, 480 patients with migraine were randomly assigned to one of four groups (Shaoyang-specific acupuncture, Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture, Yangming-specific acupuncture or sham acupuncture [control]). All groups received 20 treatments, which included electrical stimulation, over a period of four weeks. The primary outcome was the number of days with a migraine experienced during weeks 5-8 after randomization. Our secondary outcomes included the frequency of migraine attack, migraine intensity and migraine-specific quality of life. Results: Compared with patients in the control group, patients in the acupuncture groups reported fewer days with a migraine during weeks 5-8, however the differences between treatments were not significant (p &gt; 0.05). There was a significant reduction in the number of days with a migraine during weeks 13-16 in all acupuncture groups compared with control (Shaoyang-specific acupuncture v. control: difference -1.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.77 to -0.5], p = 0.003; Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture v. control: difference -1.22 [95% CI -1.92 to -0.52], p 0.001; Yangming-specific acupuncture v. control: difference -0.91 [95% CI -1.61 to -0.21], p = 0.011). We found that there was a significant, but not clinically relevant, benefit for almost all secondary outcomes in the three acupuncture groups compared with the control group. We found no relevant differences between the three acupuncture groups. Interpretation: Acupuncture tested appeared to have a clinically minor effect on migraine prophylaxis compared with sham acupuncture.

5,2019,18928574,"Background and motivation: The effectiveness of using acupuncture to treat migraine is rarely and even suspectedly reported in the literature. In this article, we report the design and the protocol of a randomized controlled large-scale trial to treat migraine using acupuncture, aiming at testifying it is effective to use acupuncture to treat migraine. We demonstrate also that the effectiveness of the treatment may vary due to using acupoints of different meridians or different acupoints of one meridian. Methods and design: A multi-center randomized controlled trial is currently undergoing, with three acupoints treatment groups and one non-acupoints control group. The acupuncture treatment consists of 20 sessions per patient with a observation period of 20 weeks. In total, 480 patients with migraine are registered in this study within 8 hospitals in China from March 2008 to June 2009. These patients are randomly assigned to receive one of the following four acupoints treatment groups, i.e. 1) specific acupoints of Shaoyang meridians (120 patients), 2) non-specific acupoints of Shaoyang meridians (120 patients), 3) acupoints of other meridians (120 patients); or 4) non-acupoints control group (120 patients). The main outcome measurement in this trial is the effect comparison achieved among these four groups in terms of number of days with migraine and intensity of migraine during and after the baseline phase, i.e. the first 4 weeks before randomization and 4, 8 and 16 weeks after randomization. The intensity of headache including headache intensity grade (0-3) and visual analogue scale (VAS) score will also be used in this study. In addition, the differences of Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (MSQ) and Transcranial Doppler Sonography (TCD) before and after randomization are also used as the secondary outcome measurement. Discussion: The result of this trial (which will be available in 2009) will demonstrate the efficacy of using acupuncture to treat migraine, and verify whether the specific effect of acupoints exists and whether this specific effect of acupoints is related to meridian and a collection of meridian Qi.

5,2019,30007828,"Background: Migraine without aura (MWoA), the most common type of migraine, has great impacts on quality of life for migraineurs. Acupuncture is used in the treatment and prevention of migraine for its analgesic effects. Objective: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to systematically assess the therapeutic and preventive effect of acupuncture treatment and its safety for MWoA. Search strategy: Nine electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Lilacs, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chongqing VIP (CQVIP), Wanfang Data and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR)) were systematically searched from their beginning through June 2017 using MeSH terms such as ""acupuncture, acupuncture therapy, electro-acupuncture, ear acupuncture, acupuncture points, acupuncture analgesia,"" and ""migraine disorders, cluster headache."" Manual searching included other conference abstracts and reference lists. Inclusion criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a clinical diagnosis of MWoA, which were treated with acupuncture versus oral medication or sham acupuncture treatment. Data extraction and analysis: Two evaluators screened and collected literature independently; they extracted information on participants, study design, interventions, follow-up, withdrawal and adverse events and assessed risk of bias and quality of the acupuncture intervention. The primary outcomes were frequency of migraine (FM) and number of migraine days (NM). Secondary outcomes included the visual analogue scale (VAS) score, effective rate (ER) and adverse events. Pooled estimates were calculated as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous data and relative risk (RR) with 95% CI for dichotomous data. Results: Overall, 14 RCTs including 1155 participants were identified. The analysis found that acupuncture had a significant advantage over medication in reducing FM (MD = -1.50; 95% CI: -2.32 to -0.68; P 0.001) and VAS score (MD = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.63-1.31; P 0.00001) and had a higher ER (RR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.16-1.45; P 0.00001). Acupuncture also had a significant advantage over sham acupuncture in the decrease of FM (MD = -1.05; 95% CI: -1.75 to -0.34; P = 0.004) and VAS score (MD = -1.19; 95% CI: -1.75 to -0.63; P 0.0001). Meanwhile, acupuncture was more tolerated than medication because of less side effect reports (RR = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.17-0.51; P 0.0001). However, the quality of evidence in the included studies was mainly low (to very low), making confidence in the FM and VAS score results low. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis shows that the effectiveness of acupuncture is still uncertain, but it might be relatively safer than medication therapy in the treatment and prophylaxis of MWoA.

6,2019,28146364,"Amygdalin is a major component of the seeds of Rosaceae family of plants such as apricots, peaches, cherry, nectarines, apples, plums, and so on, as well as almonds. It is used in alternative medicine for cancer prevention, alleviation of fever, cough suppression, and quenching thirst. The aim of the present study is to determine the mutagenic and recombinogenic effects of amygdalin in a test system Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to evaluate its potential antitumor effect in a yeast cell-based test and colon cancer cell lines. Results obtained show that concentrations 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL did not have any cytotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic effect in yeast cell-based tests. Pretreatment with amygdalin at concentration 100 μg/mL leads to around twofold of the cell survival and decrease of reverse mutation frequency, induced by the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate. The frequency of gene conversion and mitotic crossing-over is around threefold lower. The anticarcinogenic potential of amygdalin at the same concentration is presented as around fourfold reduction of Ty1 retrotransposition induced by hexavalent chromium. In summary, data presented in this study provide evidence concerning the inability of amygdalin itself to provoke events related to the initial steps of tumorigenesis. In addition, the observed antimutagenic/antirecombinogenic effect could be activation of error-free and error-prone recombination events. Based on the high selectivity toward normal or tumor cell lines, it could be speculated that amygdalin has higher cytotoxic effect in cell lines with higher proliferative and metabolic activity, which are the majority of fast developing tumors.",Is amygdalin or laetrile an effective cancer treatment?,amygdalin laetrile cancer,0.0,Is amygdalin or laetrile an effective cancer treatment?,0.7380922436714172

The beta-glucosidase content of cancer tissues is low compared to that of normal liver and small intestine. Cancer tissues contain the enzyme rhodanese in amounts comparable to that of liver and kidney and hence, cannot be attacked selectively by cyanide release through beta-glucosidase action on amygdalin. Amygdalin does not have the properties of a vitamin. Rats have been reared for several generations on diets devoid of cyanogenic glycosides, without developing neoplasms. Experiments with tumor-bearing rodents have demonstrated no curative properties by amygdalin administration.

Objective: To assess the effect of regular low-dose aspirin on outcomes for patients with vascular dementia. Design: Retrospective analysis of hospital case-notes with further outcome information from telephone calls to general practitioners, social services and institutions. Comparison of outcomes for aspirin-treated and untreated patients. Setting: One North London NHS Trust. Patients: Seventy-eight patients with clinician's diagnosis of ischaemic vascular dementia, discharged from acute inpatient units between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 1997; 38 on aspirin. Main outcome measures: Survival times from dementia onset to institutionalization and death. Results: Median survival time to institutionalization was 28 months and to death was 52 months. There was no overall difference between aspirin and non-aspirin groups for these outcomes. When data were stratified for social status, i.e. living alone or with carer when last at home, differences emerged for those living with carer. Aspirin was associated with a trend towards increased time to institutionalization (39 vs 22 months, p 0.09) and a significant advantage in time to death (71 vs 27 months, p = 0.02). These effects were non-significant after statistical adjustment for confounding variables. Conclusions: The results support but do not prove a role for regular, low-dose aspirin in improving both life expectancy and survival at home for patients with vascular dementia.

However, a number of queries remain unanswered: Is there convincing evidence that aspirin benefits patients with vascular dementia? Does aspirin affect cognition or improve prognosis? In addition, does the risk of cerebral or gastric haemorrhage outweigh any benefit? Objectives: To assess the evidence of effectiveness of the use of aspirin for vascular dementia. Search strategy: Computerized databases were searched independently by two reviewers. In addition, relevant websites were searched and some journals were handsearched. Specialists in the field were approached for unpublished material and any publications found were searched for additional references. The most recent search for trials was carried out in February 2000. Selection criteria: All randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of aspirin for vascular dementia are included. Inclusion/exclusion of studies comprised systematic assessment of the quality of study design and the risk of bias. Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted independently by both reviewers, using a previously tested data extraction form and, where required, authors were contacted for data not provided in the papers.

7,2019,12827329,"Objective: It has been reported that aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) may protect against dementia of Alzheimer's type and/or vascular dementia. However, co-morbidity and the dose of aspirin may be critical. A major indication for low-dose aspirin is prophylaxis after stroke and transient ischaemic attacks, conditions that may obscure an anti-dementia effect by the drug. Alternatively, low-dose aspirin may be insufficient if the protective effect is due to an anti-inflammatory mechanism. The aim of this study was to assess whether high-dose or low-dose aspirin may protect against Alzheimer's dementia in subjects aged &gt; or =80 years. For comparison, effects of (other) NSAID, paracetamol and D-propoxyphene were studied. Methods: Global, cross-sectional, and longitudinal (1991-2000) epidemiological analyses of clinical, cognitive and drug treatment data on 702 individuals 80 years old or more (351 twin pairs of same sex), all alive at inclusion: mean age 83.9 years (80-99 years). Calculations were made with logistic regression of associations between use of various analgesics and cognitive function, after adjustment for age, gender, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Results: Users of high-dose aspirin had significantly lower prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia and better-maintained cognitive function than non-users.

Most begin treatment with aspirin 325 mg daily (64%). The next three most common initial treatments were; no pharmacotherapy (12%), aspirin 650 mg daily (11%), and aspirin 1300 mg daily (11%). If the dementia continued to progress despite initial therapy, the treatment options were more varied. Most specialists (69%) believed that an RCT to assess the efficacy of aspirin in vascular dementia is warranted. The majority (69%) also felt that serial neuroimaging would be required for participants in such a trial, with magnetic resonance imaging being cited most frequently (41%). The majority of specialists considered three years as the minimum duration for such a trial. Conclusions: Specialist physician practice patterns vary significantly for the treatment of patients with subcortical vascular dementia. Most physicians believe that an RCT testing the efficacy of aspirin in this condition is required. However, before such a trial can be conducted, many methodological difficulties need to be addressed.",Can aspirin improve the lives of people with vascular dementia?,aspirin vascular dementia,0.0,Can aspirin improve the lives of people with vascular dementia?,0.9118288159370422

7,2019,34371202,"One of the central lesions in the brain of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is represented by aggregates of β-amyloid (Aβ), a peptide of 40-42 amino acids derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The reasons why Aβ accumulates in the brain of individuals with sporadic forms of AD are unknown. Platelets are the primary source of circulating APP and, upon activation, can secrete significant amounts of Aβ into the blood which can be actively transported to the brain across the blood-brain barrier and promote amyloid deposition. Increased platelet activity can stimulate platelet adhesion to endothelial cells, trigger the recruitment of leukocytes into the vascular wall and cause perivascular inflammation, which can spread inflammation in the brain. Neuroinflammation is fueled by activated microglial cells and reactive astrocytes that release neurotoxic cytokines and chemokines. Platelet activation is also associated with the progression of carotid artery disease resulting in an increased risk of cerebral hypoperfusion which may also contribute to the AD neurodegenerative process. Platelet activation may thus be a pathophysiological mechanism of AD and for the strong link between AD and cerebrovascular diseases. Interfering with platelet activation may represent a promising potential adjunct therapeutic approach for AD.",Can aspirin improve the lives of people with vascular dementia?,aspirin vascular dementia,0.0,Can aspirin improve the lives of people with vascular dementia?,0.973638653755188
7,2019,33613260,"Background: More people with cognitive dysfunction and dementia also fall into the category of high vascular risk, for which aspirin is one of the most frequently used drugs. However, previous studies reporting that aspirin buffers against mild cognitive decline (MCI) and dementia remain controversial. We thus conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of aspirin use with the risk of MCI and dementia in older adults. Methods: Data sources from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database for randomized controlled trails (RCTs) and cohort studies (published between January 1, 2000 and April 11, 2020). Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to pool data on the occurrence of dementia and MCI with random-effects models. Results: Of 3,193 identified articles, 15 studies (12 cohort studies and three RCTs) were eligible and were included in our analysis, which involved a total of 100,909 participants without cognitive dysfunctions or dementia at baseline. In pooled cohort studies, aspirin use did not reduce the incidence of MCI and dementia (the pooled RR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.85-1.11; <math> <msubsup><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow> <mrow><mtext>for heterogeneity</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow> </msubsup> </math> = 65%) compared with non-users. However, low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg/day) was associated with a decreased likelihood of developing dementia or MCI (the pooled RR = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.63-0.9; <math> <msubsup><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow> <mrow><mtext>for heterogeneity</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow> </msubsup> </math> = 50.5%). This association existed in studies including all-cause dementia (the pooled RR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.71-0.96) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (the pooled RR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.33-0.89), but not in MCI (the pooled RR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.31-1.08).

7,2019,33630769,"Purpose of review: We present recent developments in the field of small vessel disease (SVD)-related vascular cognitive impairment, including pathological mechanisms, updated diagnostic criteria, cognitive profile, neuroimaging markers and risk factors. We further address available management and therapeutic strategies. Recent findings: Vascular and neurodegenerative pathologies often co-occur and share similar risk factors. The updated consensus criteria aim to standardize vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) diagnosis, relying strongly on cognitive profile and MRI findings. Aggressive blood pressure control and multidomain lifestyle interventions are associated with decreased risk of cognitive impairment, but disease-modifying treatments are still lacking. Recent research has led to a better understanding of mechanisms leading to SVD-related cognitive decline, such as blood-brain barrier dysfunction, reduced cerebrovascular reactivity and impaired perivascular clearance. Summary: SVD is the leading cause of VCI and is associated with substantial morbidity. Tackling cardiovascular risk factors is currently the most effective approach to prevent cognitive decline in the elderly. Advanced imaging techniques provide tools for early diagnosis and may play an important role as surrogate markers for cognitive endpoints in clinical trials.

8,2019,18342269,"Each year millions of travelers undertake long distance flights over one or more continents. These multiple time zone flights produce a constellation of symptoms known as jet lag. Familiar to almost every intercontinental traveler is the experience of fatigue upon arrival in a new time zone, but almost as problematic are a number of other jet lag symptoms. These include reduced alertness, nighttime insomnia, loss of appetite, depressed mood, poor psychomotor coordination and reduced cognitive skills, all symptoms which are closely affected by both the length and direction of travel. The most important jet lag symptoms are due to disruptions to the body's sleep/wake cycle. Clinical and pathophysiological studies also indicate that jet lag can exacerbate existing affective disorders. It has been suggested that dysregulation of melatonin secretion and occurrence of circadian rhythm disturbances may be the common links which underlie jet lag and affective disorders. Largely because of its regulatory effects on the circadian system, melatonin has proven to be highly effective for treating the range of symptoms that accompany transmeridian air travel. Additionally, it has been found to be of value in treating mood disorders like seasonal affective disorder. Melatonin acts on MT(1) and MT(2) melatonin receptors located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei, the site of the body's master circadian clock. Melatonin resets disturbed circadian rhythms and promotes sleep in jet lag and other circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including delayed sleep phase syndrome and shift-work disorder. Although post-flight melatonin administration works efficiently in transmeridian flights across less than 7-8 times zones, in the case longer distances, melatonin should be given by 2-3 days in advance to the flight. To deal with the unwanted side effects which usually accompany this pre-departure treatment (acute soporific and sedative effects in times that may not be wanted), the suppression of circadian rhythmicity by covering symmetrically the phase delay and the phase advance portions of the phase response curve for light, together with the administration of melatonin at local bedtime to resynchronize the circadian oscillator, have been proposed. The current view that sleep loss is a major cause of jet lag has focused interest on two recently developed pharmacological agents. Ramelteon and agomelatine are melatonin receptor agonists which, compared to melatonin itself, have a longer half-life and greater affinity for melatonin receptors and consequently are thought to hold promise for treating a variety of circadian disruptions.",Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,0.661658525466919
8,2019,10484950,"Objective: The goals of this study were to validate a new rating scale for measuring severity of jet lag and to compare the efficacy of contrasting melatonin regimens to alleviate jet lag. Method: This was a randomized, double-blind trial of placebo and three alternative regimens of melatonin (5.0 mg at bedtime, 0.5 mg at bedtime, and 0.5 mg taken on a shifting schedule) for jet lag. The subjects were 257 Norwegian physicians who had visited New York for 5 days. Jet lag ratings were made on the day of travel from New York back to Oslo (6 hours eastward) and for the next 6 days in Norway. The main outcome measures were scale and item scores from a new, syndrome-specific instrument, the Columbia Jet Lag Scale, that identifies prominent daytime symptoms of jet lag distress. Results: There was a marked increase in total jet lag score in all four treatment groups on the first day at home, followed by progressive improvement over the next 5 days. However, there were no significant group differences or group-by-time interactions. In addition, there was no group effect for sleep onset, time of awakening, hours slept, or hours napping. Ratings on a summary jet lag item were highly correlated with total jet lag scores (from a low of r = 0.54 on the day of travel to a high of r = 0.80 on day 3). The internal consistency of the total jet lag score was high on each day of the study.

8,2019,20827520,"Traveling through several time zones results in a constellation of symptoms known as jet lag. These include reduced alertness, daytime fatigue, loss of appetite, reduced cognitive skills, and disruption of the sleep/wake cycle. In susceptible air travel passengers, jet lag may exacerbate affective illness and result in psychiatric morbidity. Dysregulation of circadian rhythms and melatonin secretion represent the common underlying factor in jet lag and other circadian disorders. Recent studies have established the effectiveness of strategically timed administration of melatonin and appropriate timed exposure to environmental schedules including light in counteracting the dysregulation (chronobiologic actions). With the introduction of melatonergic agonists such as ramelteon and tasimelteon, which have both a stronger affinity for MT₁ and MT₂ melatonin receptors and a longer half-life, new therapeutic options now exist for treating the sleep disturbances associated with jet lag. The melatonin analogs are unique inasmuch as they can also enhance daytime alertness. The recently introduced melatonergic antidepressant agomelatine, which has established its supremacy over other antidepressants in having a significant chronobiologic activity, represents a good choice for treating depressive symptoms that are associated with jet lag.",Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,0.9956448078155518
8,2019,20842597,"With the growth of the 24-hour global marketplace, a substantial proportion of workers are engaged in nontraditional work schedules and frequent jet travel across multiple time zones. Thus, shift work disorder and jet lag are prevalent in our 24/7 society and have been associated with significant health and safety repercussions. In both disorders, treatment strategies are based on promoting good sleep hygiene, improving circadian alignment, and targeting specific symptoms.Treatment of shift work must be tailored to the type of shift. For a night worker, circadian alignment can be achieved with bright light exposure during the shift and avoidance of bright light (with dark or amber sunglasses) toward the latter portion of the work period and during the morning commute home. If insomnia and/or excessive sleepiness are prominent complaints despite behavioral approaches and adequate opportunity for sleep, melatonin may be administered prior to the day sleep period to improve sleep, and alertness during work can be augmented by caffeine and wake-promoting agents.For jet lag, circadian adaptation is suggested only for travel greater than 48 h, with travel east more challenging than travel west. Although advancing sleep and wake times and circadian timing for eastward travel with evening melatonin and morning bright light several days prior to departure can help avoid jet lag at the new destination, this approach may be impractical for many people, Therefore, strategies for treatment at the destination, such as avoidance of early morning light and exposure to late-morning and afternoon light alone or in conjunction with bedtime melatonin, can accelerate re-entrainment following eastward travel. For westward travel, a circadian delay can be achieved after arrival with afternoon and early-evening light with bedtime melatonin.Good sleep hygiene practices, together with the application of circadian principles, can improve sleep quality, alertness, performance, and safety in shift workers and jet travelers.

8,2019,12612500,"What is the effect of melatonin on jet lag syndrome? Jet lag desynchronizes the internal sleep-wakefulness cycle with the environmental light/dark cycle. Advance (but not delay) of light onset is known to abolish pineal N-acetyltransferase activity and urine excretion of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin. Measurements of pineal serotonin, the substrate of melatonin biosynthesis; N-acetylserotonin (NAS), the immediate melatonin precursor; and melatonin (high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorimetric method) in the animal (rat) model of jet lag revealed that prolonged delay of dark-phase onset disrupted the rhytms in comparable ways as the advance of light-phase onset. Advance of dark phase onset resulted in less severe disturbances of rhythms as compared with the advance of light phase onset. Melatonin, but not NAS, injections at the beginning of a new dark period accelerated recovery of NAS and melatonin, but not serotonin, rhythms. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were more sensitive to advance of light onset and less responsive to melatonin injections than normotensive rats. NAS and methylene blue, an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A, attenuated light-induced disruption of NAS but not melatonin rhythms. We draw the following conclusions from our data: the beginning of the dark period may be preferable to the beginning of light period as the arrival time on eastward flights; the efficacy of melatonin in alleviating jet lag may be enhanced by administering it before, during and after rapid transition through time zones; and hypertension may exaggerate jet lag syndrome.",Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,0.9971785545349121

When used for curative treatment, exercise diminishes disability and pain severity while improving fitness and occupational status in patients who have subacute, recurrent, or chronic low back pain. Patients with acute low back pain are usually advised to continue their everyday activities to the greatest extent possible rather than to start an exercise program. Supervision is crucial to the efficacy of exercise programs.

11,2019,32498492,"Background: Exercise is considered an effective intervention to relieve chronic back pain. However, it is still unknown whether specific exercise patterns vary in terms of their efficiency and effectiveness. Aim: To investigate the differential health and economic effects of intensity, specificity and degree of subjective perceived physical exertion across five exercise patterns (endurance, gymnastics, fitness, back gymnastics, multimodal back exercise) in adults with back pain. Design: Longitudinal observational cohort study over a period of 24 months. Setting: Various non-therapeutic exercise facilities (e.g. outdoor, fitness centers, health insurance programs, sports clubs) across one federal state of Germany (Baden-Wuerttemberg). Population: Adults with back pain (N.=2,542, Mean =46.9 years, 66% females, graded chronic back pain [GCPS] 1=40.5%, GCPS 2=27.3%, GCPS 3=20.7%, GCPS 4=11.5%). Methods: Self-reported back pain (functional restrictions and pain = back pain function score, [BPFS]) and characteristics of exercising behavior (frequency, duration, type, physical exertion) were assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Direct medical costs for back disorders (international classification of diseases, dorsopathies: M40-M54) were compiled from health insurance records. Results: Moderate- to high-intensity exercise patterns were effective in reducing back pain, particularly at lower levels of subjective perceived physical exertion. At these intensity levels, multimodal back exercise (i.e. exercising the spine-stabilizing muscles specifically, ergonomic training) was 14.5 times more effective than non-back specific fitness exercise in reducing BPFS. The beneficial effects of both exercise types increased with the initial severity of back pain. However, only multimodal back exercise (moderate- to high-intensity/high back specificity) was associated with a significant decrease in direct medical costs for back pain. Conclusions: Targeted exercise of the spine-stabilizing musculature at moderate to high intensities without maximum perceived exertion is effective and efficient in reducing back pain. Clinical rehabilitation impact: The combination of high-intensity and high-specificity exercises yielded a significant reduction in medical costs.

11,2019,35295510,"Objective: Exercise may reduce pain sensitivity. This phenomenon called exercise-induced hypoalgesia is observed in different types of exercises and involves the activation of endogenous pain modulation systems. Although the effect of limb exercise on pain sensitivity has often been tested, few studies explored the impact of back exercises that are often used to treat low back pain. The main objective is to measure the effect of back-muscle exercise on pain sensitivity and compare it to the effect of a limb-muscle exercise. Methods: Twenty-three participants who were pain-free performed a 4-min wrist flexion isometric contraction followed by a 4-min low back extension, separated by a 20-min break. Pressure pain thresholds were tested at two low back (S1 spinous process, lumbar erector spinae muscle) and two wrist (capitate bone, wrist flexor muscles) sites before and after each exercise. For each exercise, sites were considered as remote or local in relation to the muscles contracted during the exercise. An independent sample of 11 participants was recruited to confirm the influence of low back extension on pain sensitivity. Results: Wrist exercise induced a larger increase in pain sensitivity than back exercise at the remote site. Only wrist exercise induced a hypoalgesia effect at both the local and the remote sites. Back exercise induced a similar effect in the independent sample. Conclusions: This study showed that back and wrist exercises induced a distinct effect on pain sensitivity in participants who were pain-free. The wrist exercise induced a systemic reduction in pain sensitivity (locally and remotely), whereas the back exercise did not.

Results: Among all patients, there were no associations between either the number of exercise minutes per week or the number of days of back exercise per week and short-term (6-month) changes in pain, stiffness, or HAQ Disability Index. However, among those who had AS for 15 years or less, pain scores were 0.18 points lower (on a scale of 0-3; P =.04), and stiffness scores were 6.4 points lower (on a scale of 0-100; P =.005) during periods with more than 200 minutes per week of exercise compared with periods with 0 to 30 minutes of exercise per week. Among those who had AS for more than 15 years, pain scores were 0.11 points lower (on a scale of 0-3; P =. 03), and HAQ Disability Indexes were 0.08 points lower (on a scale of 0-3; P .001) during periods with 5 to 7 days per week of back exercise compared with periods when back exercises were not performed. Less intense levels of exercise were not associated with improvements in health status. Conclusions: Unsupervised recreational exercise improves pain and stiffness, and back exercise improves pain and function in patients with AS, but these effects differ with the duration of AS. Health status is improved when patients perform recreational exercise at least 30 minutes per day and back exercises at least 5 days per week.

11,2019,14749199,"Background context: Exercise is a widely prescribed treatment for chronic low back pain, with demonstrated effectiveness for improving function and work. Purpose: The goal of this article is to review several key aspects about the safety and efficacy of exercise that may help clinicians understand its utility in treating chronic back pain. Study design/setting: A computerized literature search of MEDLINE was conducted using ""exercise,"" ""fitness,"" ""back pain,"" ""backache"" and ""rehabilitation"" as search words. Identified abstracts were scanned, and useful articles were acquired for further review. Additional references were acquired through the personal collections of research papers possessed by the authors and by reviewing prior review articles on this subject. These final papers were scrutinized for data relevant to the key aspects about exercise covered in this article. Results: For people with acute, subacute or chronic low back pain, there is no evidence that exercise increases the risk of additional back problems or work disability. To the contrary, current medical literature suggests that exercise has either a neutral effect or may slightly reduce risk of future back injuries. Exercise can be prescribed for patients with chronic low back pain with three distinct goals. The first and most obvious goal is to improve or eliminate impairments in back flexibility and strength, and improve performance of endurance activities. There is a large body of evidence confirming that this goal can be accomplished for a majority of patients with chronic low back pain. The second goal of exercise is to reduce the intensity of back pain. Most studies of exercise have noted overall reduction in back pain intensity that ranges from 10% to 50% after exercise treatment. The third goal of exercise is to reduce back pain-related disability through a process of desensitization of fears and concerns, altering pain attitudes and beliefs and improving affect. The mechanisms through which exercise can accomplish this goal have been the subject of substantial research. Conclusions: Exercise is safe for individuals with back pain, because it does not increase the risk of future back injuries or work absence. Substantial evidence exists supporting the use of exercise as a therapeutic tool to improve impairments in back flexibility and strength. Most studies have observed improvements in global pain ratings after exercise programs, and many have observed that exercise can lessen the behavioral, cognitive, affect and disability aspects of back pain syndromes.",Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,0.9704693555831909
11,2019,33400333,"Objectives: Exercise therapy is recommended for low back pain (LBP) although the immediate effects on pain are highly variable. In 96 individuals with LBP this cross-sectional study explored (a) the magnitude of exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) and (b) measures of pain sensitivity and clinical pain manifestations in individuals reporting a clinical relevant increase in back pain during physical activity compared with individuals reporting low or no increase in back pain during physical activity. Methods: Cuff algometry was performed at baseline on the leg to assess pressure pain threshold (cPPT), tolerance (cPTT) and temporal summation of pain (cTSP). Manual PPTs were assessed on the back and leg before and after a 6-min walk test (6MWT). Back pain was scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) after each minute of walking. The EIH-effect was estimated as the increase in PPTs after the walk exercise. Results: Twenty-seven individuals reported an increase of ≥2/10 in pain NRS scores during walking and compared with the individuals with 2/10 NRS scores: cPPT and EIH-effects were lower whereas cTSP, pain intensity and disability were increased (p 0.03). Baseline NRS scores, EIH and pain thresholds were associated with the likelihood of an increase of ≥2/10 in back pain intensity during walking (p 0.05). Conclusions: Pain flares in response to physical activity in individuals with LBP seem to be linked with baseline pain sensitivity and pain intensity, and impair the beneficial EIH. Such information may better inform when individuals with LBP will have a beneficial effect of physical activity. Significance: Pain flares in response to physical activity in individuals with LBP seem to be linked with baseline pain sensitivity and pain intensity, and impair the beneficial exercise-induced hypoalgesia. Such information may better inform when individuals with LBP will have a beneficial effect of physical activity.",Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,0.7786501049995422

This article explores, in detail, the data on which this recommendation is based, the difficulty in translating results from high risk adults in a research setting to the general public, the impact of risk compensation, and how circumcision compares to existing alternatives. Based on our analysis it is concluded that the circumcision solution is a wasteful distraction that takes resources away from more effective, less expensive, less invasive alternatives.

12,2019,25919012,"Background: A randomized trial of voluntary medical male circumcision (MC) of HIV-infected men reported increased HIV transmission to female partners among men who resumed sexual intercourse prior to wound healing. We conducted a prospective observational study to assess penile HIV shedding after MC. Methods and findings: HIV shedding was evaluated among 223 HIV-infected men (183 self-reported not receiving antiretroviral therapy [ART], 11 self-reported receiving ART and had a detectable plasma viral load [VL], and 29 self-reported receiving ART and had an undetectable plasma VL [ 400 copies/ml]) in Rakai, Uganda, between June 2009 and April 2012. Preoperative and weekly penile lavages collected for 6 wk and then at 12 wk were tested for HIV shedding and VL using a real-time quantitative PCR assay. Unadjusted prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) and adjusted PRRs (adjPRRs) of HIV shedding were estimated using modified Poisson regression with robust variance. HIV shedding was detected in 9.3% (17/183) of men not on ART prior to surgery and 39.3% (72/183) of these men during the entire study. Relative to baseline, the proportion shedding was significantly increased after MC at 1 wk (PRR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.12-3.14, p = 0.012), 2 wk (PRR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.94-5.13, p 0.001), and 3 wk (PRR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.19-3.28, p = 0.008) after MC. However, compared to baseline, HIV shedding was decreased by 6 wk after MC (PRR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.09-0.83, p = 0.023) and remained suppressed at 12 wk after MC (PRR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.06-0.64, p = 0.008). Detectable HIV shedding from MC wounds occurred in more study visits among men with an HIV plasma VL &gt; 50,000 copies/ml than among those with an HIV plasma VL 400 copies/ml (adjPRR = 10.3, 95% CI = 4.25-24.90, p 0.001). Detectable HIV shedding was less common in visits from men with healed MC wounds compared to visits from men without healed wounds (adjPRR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.07-0.23, p 0.001) and in visits from men on ART with undetectable plasma VL compared to men not on ART (PRR = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.05-0.43, p = 0.001). Among men with detectable penile HIV shedding, the median log10 HIV copies/milliliter of lavage fluid was significantly lower in men with ART-induced undetectable plasma VL (1.93, interquartile range [IQR] = 1.83-2.14) than in men not on ART (2.63, IQR = 2.28-3.22, p 0.001). Limitations of this observational study include significant differences in baseline covariates, lack of confirmed receipt of ART for individuals who reported ART use, and lack of information on potential ART initiation during follow-up for those who were not on ART at enrollment. Conclusion: Penile HIV shedding is significantly reduced after healing of MC wounds. Lower plasma VL is associated with decreased frequency and quantity of HIV shedding from MC wounds. Starting ART prior to MC should be considered to reduce male-to-female HIV transmission risk. Research is needed to assess the time on ART required to decrease shedding, and the acceptability and feasibility of initiating ART at the time of MC.",Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,0.6938872337341309
12,2019,25760456,"Billions of dollars to circumcise millions of African males as an HIV infection prevention have been sought, yet the effectiveness of circumcision has not been demonstrated. Data from 109 populations comparing HIV prevalence and incidence in men based on circumcision status were evaluated using meta-regression. The impact on the association between circumcision and HIV incidence/prevalence of the HIV risk profile of the population, the circumcision rates within the population and whether the population was in Africa were assessed. No significant difference in the risk of HIV infection based on the circumcision status was seen in general populations. Studies of high-risk populations and populations with a higher prevalence of male circumcision reported significantly greater odds ratios (odds of intact man having HIV) (p .0001). When adjusted for the impact of a high-risk population and the circumcision rate of the population, the baseline odds ratio was 0.78 (95% CI = 0.56-1.09). No consistent association between presence of HIV infection and circumcision status of adult males in general populations was found.

12,2019,20622758,"Three randomized controlled trials in sub-Saharan Africa have shown that circumcision reduces the risk of acquiring HIV infection in men by approximately 60%. In this paper, we review the evidence that male circumcision protects against infection with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men and their female partners. Data from the clinical trials indicate that circumcision may be protective against genital ulcer disease, Herpes simplex type 2, Trichomonas vaginalis and human papillomavirus infection in men. No evidence exists of a protective effect against Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhea. There is weak evidence that circumcision has a direct protective effect on HIV infection in women, although there is likely to be an indirect benefit, since HIV prevalence is likely to be lower in circumcised male partners. Although there is little evidence from the trials of serious adverse events from the procedure and of behavioural risk compensation among circumcised men, essential operational research is being conducted to evaluate these key issues outside the trial setting as circumcision services are expanded. Following the publication of the clinical trial results in early 2007, the World Health Organization/UNAIDS has advised that promotion of male circumcision should be included as an additional HIV strategy for the prevention of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men in areas of high HIV prevalence. As circumcision services are expanded in settings where resources are limited, non-physician providers including nurses will play an important role in the provision of services.",Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,0.2381211817264557

12,2019,33025391,"To reduce HIV incidence in countries such as Eswatini (Swaziland), UNAIDS has recommended male circumcision as one possible effective strategy. We analyzed the 2016s Swaziland HIV Incidence Measurement Survey to explore the association between early circumcision and HIV history among 2964 sexually active adult males aged 15 to 64 years old. Early circumcision was defined as circumcision practiced at an age of 15 years old or younger. Results from logistic regression and OLS regression found that male adults with early circumcision are more likely to have multiple sexual partners and to use condoms. Multiple partners and condom use at last sex encounter remained associated with a higher odds of being HIV positive after controlling for all factors. Nevertheless, early circumcision is significantly associated with a lower odds of being HIV positive (AOR 0.53, p 0.01). These findings suggest that HIV prevention may benefit when early male circumcision is carried out.",Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,0.2628478705883026
12,2019,19571722,"Objective: To evaluate whether sexual intercourse soon after adult male circumcision affected HIV risk. Design: Combined analysis of data from African trials of men who were randomized to and underwent circumcision. Methods: We examined two associations: early sex (intercourse 42 days after circumcision) and HIV acquisition at 3 months for the Orange Farm and Kisumu trials and at 6 months for the Rakai and Kisumu trials and incomplete wound healing at 1 month and seroconversion at 3 and 6 months for the Kisumu trial and at 6 months for the Rakai trial. Results: Early sex was reported by 3.9% of participants in Kisumu, 5.4% in Rakai, and 22.5% in Orange Farm. HIV seroprevalence was 0.0% at 3 months and 1.9% at 6 months among 18-24-year-olds reporting early sex and 0.2% at 3 months and 0.6% at 6 months among those who did not report early sex. In pooled analyses, men reporting early sex did not have higher HIV infection risk at 3 or 6 months. In Kisumu, 16 (1.3%) men had incomplete wound healing at the 30-day visit. One (6.3%) of these seroconverted at 3 months compared with 2 (0.2%) of 1246 men with complete wound healing (P = 0.075). No association was observed between incomplete wound healing and seroconversion for Rakai participants. Conclusion: Most men delayed intercourse after circumcision. Early sex after circumcision was not associated with HIV risk, although the study power was limited. Nevertheless, men should delay intercourse to limit the potential for increased HIV risk until complete wound healing.",Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,0.33873215317726135

Methods: Four people with expertise and/or interest in the area of circumcision and HIV were asked to contribute their opinions. Main outcome measure: To provide food for thought, discussion, and possible further research in a poorly discussed area of sexual medicine. Results: Three clinical trials in Africa showed the benefit of circumcision in reducing HIV incidence in men. Sadeghi-Nejad cites these, but balances this with the pandemic in India, and the cultural implications of circumcision. Pollack cites these studies as well, but reinforces the World Health Organization and UNAIDS recommendations that male circumcision should not replace safe sex. As a Nigerian, Aisuodionoe-Shadrach discusses the indirect ways in which circumcision can reduce the spread of HIV, and advocates the surgery, although he proposes infant circumcision may be wiser. Ira Sharlip, President of the International Society for Sexual Medicine, explains some of the physiology involved while again citing the three recent African studies. He questions who would be circumcised and who would perform the procedure if pro-circumcision policies were adopted. Conclusion: While three clinical trials in Africa were halted after it became evident that circumcision was beneficial in protecting against HIV, further information on the health risks and benefits of male circumcision is needed.

There are a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses which have investigated the efficacy of the treatments, while the methodological quality of them has not been assessed yet. This study aims to evaluate the methodological quality of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses investigating the effect of antidepressants on low back pain. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Library databases up to November 2018. The 16-item Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR2) scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the Antidepressants treatment effects on low back pain published in English language were included. There was no limitation on the type of Antidepressants drugs, clinical setting, and study population, while non-systematical reviews and qualitative and narrative reviews were excluded. Results: A total of 25 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were evaluated; the studies were reported between 1992 and 2017. Obtained results from AMSTAR2 showed that 11 (44%), 9 (36%) and 5 (20%) of the included studies had high, moderate and low qualities, respectively. 13(52%) of studies assessed risk of bias and 2(20%) of meta analyses considered publication bias. Also, 16 (64%) of the included reviews provided a satisfactory explanation for any heterogeneity observed in the results.

13,2019,29578822,"Introduction: Low back pain is associated with a large burden-of-illness. It is responsible for the most years lived with disability as compared with any other medical condition. A comprehensive overview of the evidence on pharmacological treatment options for chronic low back pain is lacking. This review evaluates the evidence for the benefits and risks of currently available pharmacological treatments for chronic low back pain. Areas covered: The authors focus on the recent (Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials covering paracetamol (acetaminophen), NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, opioids, and other (new) drugs. Expert opinion: The overall impression of the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for patients with chronic low back pain is rather sobering. The effects on pain reduction and improvement of function are commonly small to moderate and short lasting when compared to placebo. At the same time, the various types of drugs are not without side-effects. This holds especially true for serious side-effects associated with (prolonged) use of strong opioids.

13,2019,18253994,"Background: Antidepressants are commonly used in the management of low-back pain. However, their use is controversial. Objectives: The aim of this review was to determine whether antidepressants are more effective than placebo for the treatment of non-specific low-back pain. Search strategy: Randomised controlled trials were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE (to September 2007), PsycINFO to June 2006, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 2006, issue 2, and previous systematic reviews. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials that compared antidepressant medication and placebo for patients with non-specific low-back pain, and used at least one clinically relevant outcome measure. Data collection and analysis: Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the trials. Meta-analyses were used to examine the effect of antidepressants on pain, depression and function, and the effect of antidepressant type on pain. To account for studies that could not be pooled, additional qualitative analyses were performed using the levels of evidence recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. Main results: Ten trials that compared antidepressants with placebo were included in this review. The pooled analyses showed no difference in pain relief (six trials; standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to 0.16)) or depression (two trials; SMD 0.06 (95% CI -0.29 to 0.40)) between antidepressant and placebo treatments. The qualitative analyses found conflicting evidence on the effect of antidepressants on pain intensity in chronic low-back pain, and no clear evidence that antidepressants reduce depression in chronic low-back pain patients. Two pooled analyses showed no difference in pain relief between different types of antidepressants and placebo. Our findings were not altered by the sensitivity analyses which varied the level of methodological quality required for inclusion in the meta-analyses to allow data from additional trials to be examined. Two additional trials were identified in September 2007 and await assessment.

A literature synthesis was performed to determine whether antidepressants are more effective than placebos in decreasing pain, disability, depression, and analgesic medication use in such patients. Methods: English-language journal articles were identified from MEDLINE and PsycLIT databases, bibliographies, and inquiries to researchers and drug companies. Articles were included if they reported data from placebo-controlled or drug comparison trials of antidepressants for patients with low back pain. Six articles met these criteria. Results: Three studies compared the effects of antidepressants and placebos on pain; two found no difference and one found a trend toward superiority of imipramine for patient-rated symptoms but no difference in investigator ratings. Effects on functional disability were examined in three antidepressant-placebo comparisons; only one found the antidepressant to be more effective. Antidepressant effects of an antidepressant vs placebo were compared in three studies; none found a significant difference. Effects on analgesic medication use were compared in three studies; one found amitriptyline to be superior and the others found no difference. Serious methodologic flaws characterized all six studies, and insufficient reporting of data precluded meta-analysis.

The efficacy, acceptability, and safety of antidepressant medicines for low back pain (LBP) are not clear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of antidepressant medicines for LBP. Methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov , the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform from inception to May 2020. We included published and trial registry reports of RCTs that allocated adult participants with LBP to receive an antidepressant medicine or a placebo medicine. Pairs of authors independently extracted data in duplicate. We extracted participant characteristics, study sample size, outcome values, and measures of variance for each outcome. We data using random-effects meta-analysis models and calculated estimates of effects and heterogeneity for each outcome. We formed judgments of confidence in the evidence in accordance with GRADE. We report our findings in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We prespecified all outcomes in a prospectively registered protocol. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and acceptability. We measured pain intensity at end-of-treatment on a 0-100 point scale and considered 10 points the minimal clinically important difference. We defined acceptability as the odds of stopping treatment for any reason. Results: We included 23 RCTs in this review. Data were available for pain in 17 trials and acceptability in 14 trials. Treatment with antidepressants decreased pain intensity by 4.33 points (95% CI - 6.15 to - 2.50) on a 0-100 scale, compared to placebo. Treatment with antidepressants increased the odds of stopping treatment for any reason (OR 1.27 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.56]), compared to placebo. Conclusions: Treatment of LBP with antidepressants is associated with small reductions in pain intensity and increased odds of stopping treatment for any reason, compared to placebo. The effect on pain is not clinically important. The effect on acceptability warrants consideration. These findings provide Level I evidence to guide clinicians in their use of antidepressants to treat LBP.

13,2019,21083513,"Aim: To review pharmacological management of chronic low back pain (LBP), with respect to management of nociceptive and neuropathic components. Methods: Studies were identified by a PubMed search of English-language papers from the last 10 years, with additional hand searches of relevant reviews. Discussion: Paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors target the nociceptive component of chronic LBP, and do not affect neuropathic pain mechanisms. Antidepressants target the neuropathic component of chronic LBP; however, conflicting efficacy results have been reported. Opioids target both nociceptive and to a lesser extent neuropathic pain. They are effective in chronic LBP, but many patients require higher doses or combination treatment. The long-term efficacy of opioids in chronic LBP has been questioned because of the absence of high-quality data and concerns regarding tolerability and dependence. The topical preparation lidocaine 5% plaster, indicated in post-herpetic neuralgia, is effective in localized neuropathic pain in patients with chronic LBP. Pregabalin is ineffective as monotherapy for chronic LBP but is effective when combined with celecoxib or opioids. Muscle relaxant monotherapy is ineffective in chronic LBP. Combination therapy is often necessary in patients with chronic LBP, in order to manage both nociceptive and neuropathic pain components. Conclusion: Chronic LBP often comprises both nociceptive and neuropathic components, therefore a multimodal and individualized treatment approach is necessary. Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action (e.g. an agent with µ-receptor activity plus an agent of a different class) represents a rational approach to management of chronic LBP with both nociceptive and neuropathic components.",Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,antidepressants low-back pain,0.0,Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,0.86655592918396

Objectives: To systematically review the efficacy of antidepressants for the treatment of patients with back pain and to determine whether there is evidence that outcomes vary between classes of antidepressants. Materials and methods: Best evidence synthesis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral antidepressive agents in patients with back pain. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry. Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and assessed included studies with a 22-point methodologic quality assessment scale. Effect sizes were calculated if sufficient data were available. Results: Twenty-two trials of antidepressants for the treatment of back pain were identified, of which seven studies of chronic low back pain met inclusion criteria. Among studies using antidepressants that inhibit norepinephrine reuptake (tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants), four of five found significant improvement in at least one relevant outcome measure. Assessment of these agents' impact on functional measures produced mixed results. No benefit in pain relief or functional status was found in three studies of antidepressants that do not inhibit norepinephrine reuptake. Conclusions: Based on a small number of studies, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants appear to produce moderate symptom reductions for patients with chronic low back pain. This benefit appears to be independent of depression status. SSRIs do not appear to be beneficial for patients with chronic low back pain.

13,2019,18638685,"This article reviews the pharmacologic and clinical evidence supporting the use of antidepressant drugs for treating painful rheumatologic conditions. Clinical studies have shown that tricyclic antidepressants, even at low doses, have analgesic effects in rheumatologic conditions equivalent to those of serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors, but are less well tolerated. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may also have analgesic effects, but higher doses are required to achieve analgesia in conditions such as fibromyalgia and low back pain. Antidepressant drugs may be useful in painful rheumatologic conditions, but in some studies the analgesic effects of antidepressants may be associated with functional impairment, sleep disorders, and fatigue. Further studies are required to determine antidepressants' analgesic mechanism of action and the specific role they should play in the management of chronic painful rheumatologic conditions.",Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,antidepressants low-back pain,0.0,Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,0.9463876485824585
13,2019,20205483,"Low back pain is one of the most common conditions encountered in clinical practice and medications are the most commonly used type of treatment. In most patients, low back pain is nonspecific, in that the pain cannot be reliably attributed to a specific condition or abnormality in the back. Although a number of medications are available to treat nonspecific low back pain, selecting a therapy can be a challenge because each one is associated with a unique set of benefits and harms. In addition, the evidence supporting the use of different medications varies, and issues such as costs and patient preferences may also affect treatment choices. A guideline published in 2007 from the American Pain Society and the American College of Physicians on diagnosis and treatment of low back pain includes recommendations on the use of medications, based on the quality of supporting evidence and the estimated magnitude of benefits relative to harms. For most patients with low back pain, regardless of the duration of symptoms, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and NSAIDs are first-line options for pain relief. Opioids are more potent analgesics, but are not a first-line option due to their abuse potential. Skeletal muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines can be used as adjunctive medications for acute low back pain, but have a high incidence of sedation. Tricyclic antidepressants may be an option for chronic low back pain, but their effects on pain appear small or uncertain. Nonetheless, depression is common in patients with low back pain and should be treated appropriately. When choosing medications for treatment of low back pain, practice guidelines provide a useful starting point for making decisions, but clinicians should base therapeutic choices on individualized consideration and discussion with patients regarding the potential benefits and risks.",Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,antidepressants low-back pain,0.0,Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,0.8720952272415161
13,2019,27770809,"Background: Low back pain is a major clinical and public health problem, with limited evidence-based treatments. Low-dose antidepressants are commonly used to treat pain in chronic low back pain. However, their efficacy is unproven. The aim of this pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial is to determine whether low-dose amitriptyline (an antidepressant) is more effective than placebo in reducing pain in individuals with chronic low back pain. Methods/design: One hundred and fifty individuals with chronic low back pain will be recruited through hospital and private medical and allied health clinics, advertising in local media and posting of flyers in community locations. They will be randomly allocated to receive either low-dose amitriptyline (25 mg) or an active placebo (benztropine mesylate, 1 mg) for 6 months. The primary outcome measure of pain intensity will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months using validated questionnaires. Secondary measures of self-reported low back disability, work absence and hindrance in the performance of paid/unpaid work will also be examined. Intention-to-treat analyses will be performed. Discussion: This pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial will provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of low-dose antidepressants compared with placebo in reducing pain, disability, work absenteeism and hindrance in work performance in individuals with chronic low back pain. This trial has major public health and clinical importance as it has the potential to provide an effective approach to the management of chronic low back pain.

16,2019,32956536,"Background: Skeletal muscle cramps are common and often occur in association with pregnancy, advanced age, exercise or motor neuron disorders (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Typically, such cramps have no obvious underlying pathology, and so are termed idiopathic. Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps but the efficacy of magnesium for this purpose remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012, and performed to identify and incorporate more recent studies. Objectives: To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation compared to no treatment, placebo control or other cramp therapies in people with skeletal muscle cramps. SEARCH METHODS: On 9 September 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and SPORTDiscus. We also searched WHO-ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov for registered trials that might be ongoing or unpublished, and ISI Web of Science for studies citing the studies included in this review. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of magnesium supplementation (in any form) to prevent skeletal muscle cramps in any patient group (i.e. all clinical presentations of cramp). We considered comparisons of magnesium with no treatment, placebo control, or other therapy. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Two review authors assessed risk of bias. We attempted to contact all study authors when questions arose and obtained participant-level data for four of the included trials, one of which was unpublished. We collected all data on adverse effects from the included RCTs. Main results: We identified 11 trials (nine parallel-group, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 735 individuals, amongst whom 118 cross-over participants additionally served as their own controls. Five trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps (408 participants) and five trials enrolled people with idiopathic cramps (271 participants, with 118 additionally crossed over to control). Another study enrolled 29 people with liver cirrhosis, only some of whom suffered muscle cramps. All trials provided magnesium as an oral supplement, except for one trial which provided magnesium as a series of slow intravenous infusions. Nine trials compared magnesium to placebo, one trial compared magnesium to no treatment, calcium carbonate or vitamin B, and another trial compared magnesium to vitamin E or calcium. We judged the single trial in people with liver cirrhosis and all five trials in participants with pregnancy-associated leg cramps to be at high risk of bias. In contrast, we rated the risk of bias high in only one of five trials in participants with idiopathic rest cramps. For idiopathic cramps, largely in older adults (mean age 61.6 to 69.3 years) presumed to have nocturnal leg cramps (the commonest presentation), differences in measures of cramp frequency when comparing magnesium to placebo were small, not statistically significant, and showed minimal heterogeneity (I² = 0% to 12%). This includes the primary endpoint, percentage change from baseline in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (mean difference (MD) -9.59%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -23.14% to 3.97%; 3 studies, 177 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the difference in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (MD -0.18 cramps/week, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.49; 5 studies, 307 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 3 studies, 177 participants; high-certainty evidence). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found at four weeks in measures of cramp intensity or cramp duration. This includes the number of participants rating their cramps as moderate or severe at four weeks (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.21; 2 studies, 91 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the percentage of participants with the majority of cramp durations of one minute or more at four weeks (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.53, 1 study, 46 participants; low-certainty evidence). We were unable to perform meta-analysis for trials of pregnancy-associated leg cramps. The single study comparing magnesium to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a three-point ordinal scale of overall treatment efficacy. Of the three trials comparing magnesium to placebo, one found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures, another found benefit for both, and a third reported inconsistent results for frequency that could not be reconciled. The single study in people with liver cirrhosis was small and had limited reporting of cramps, but found no difference in terms of cramp frequency or cramp intensity. Our analysis of adverse events pooled all studies, regardless of the setting in which cramps occurred. Major adverse events (occurring in 2 out of 72 magnesium recipients and 3 out of 68 placebo recipients), and withdrawals due to adverse events, were not significantly different from placebo. However, in the four studies for which it could be determined, more participants experienced minor adverse events in the magnesium group than in the placebo group (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.33; 4 studies, 254 participants; low-certainty evidence). Overall, oral magnesium was associated with mostly gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g. diarrhoea), experienced by 11% (10% in control) to 37% (14% in control) of participants. Authors' conclusions: It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this population is needed. We found no RCTs evaluating magnesium for exercise-associated muscle cramps or disease-state-associated muscle cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease) other than a single small (inconclusive) study in people with liver cirrhosis, only some of whom suffered cramps.",Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,0.6333757042884827

16,2019,33149925,"Purpose of review: Strategies to mitigate muscle cramps are a top research priority for patients receiving hemodialysis. As hypomagnesemia is a possible risk factor for cramping, we reviewed the literature to better understand the physiology of cramping as well as the epidemiology of hypomagnesemia and muscle cramps. We also sought to review the evidence from interventional studies on the effect of oral and dialysate magnesium-based therapies on muscle cramps. Sources of information: Peer-reviewed articles. Methods: We searched for relevant articles in major bibliographic databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE. The methodological quality of interventional studies was assessed using a modified version of the Downs and Blacks criteria checklist. Key findings: The etiology of muscle cramps in patients receiving hemodialysis is poorly understood and there are no clear evidence-based prevention or treatment strategies. Several factors may play a role including a low concentration of serum magnesium. The prevalence of hypomagnesemia (concentration of 0.7 mmol/L) in patients receiving hemodialysis ranges from 10% to 20%. Causes of hypomagnesemia include a low dietary intake of magnesium, use of medications that inhibit magnesium absorption (eg, proton pump inhibitors), increased magnesium excretion (eg, high-dose loop diuretics), and a low concentration of dialysate magnesium. Dialysate magnesium concentrations of ≤0.5 mmol/L may be associated with a decrease in serum magnesium concentration over time. Preliminary evidence from observational and interventional studies suggests a higher dialysate magnesium concentration will raise serum magnesium concentrations and may reduce the frequency and severity of muscle cramps. However, the quality of evidence supporting this benefit is limited, and larger, multicenter clinical trials are needed to further determine if magnesium-based therapy can reduce muscle cramps in patients receiving hemodialysis. In studies conducted to date, increasing the concentration of dialysate magnesium appears to be well-tolerated and is associated with a low risk of symptomatic hypermagnesemia. Limitations: Few interventional studies have examined the effect of magnesium-based therapy on muscle cramps in patients receiving hemodialysis and most were nonrandomized, pre-post study designs.",Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,0.936501681804657

Low serum magnesium levels are associated with metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension; consequently, some individuals benefit from magnesium supplementation: increasing magnesium consumption appears to prevent high blood pressure, and higher serum magnesium levels are associated with a lower risk of developing a metabolic syndrome. There are, however, conflicting study results regarding magnesium administration with myocardial infarction with and without reperfusion therapy. There was a long controversy as to whether or not magnesium should be given as a first-line medication. As the most recent trials have not shown any difference in outcome, intravenous magnesium cannot be recommended in patients with myocardial infarction today. However, magnesium has its indication in patients with torsade de pointes and has been given successfully to patients with digoxin-induced arrhythmia or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

Objectives: To determine which interventions are used to prevent back and neck pain problems as well as what the evidence is for their utility. Summary of background data: Given the difficulty in successfully treating long-term back and neck pain problems, there has been a call for preventive interventions. Little is known, however, about the value of preventive efforts for nonpatients, e.g., in the general population or workplace. Methods: The literature was systematically searched to locate all investigations that were: 1) specifically designed as a preventive intervention; 2) randomized or nonrandomized controlled trials; and, 3) using subjects not seeking treatment. Outcome was evaluated on the key variables of reported pain, report of injury, dysfunction, time off work, health-care utilization, and cost. Conclusions were drawn using a grading system. Results: Twenty-seven investigations meeting the criteria were found for educational efforts, lumbar supports, exercises, ergonomics, and risk factor modification. For back schools, only one of the nine randomized trials reported a significant effect, and there was strong evidence that back schools are not effective in prevention. Because the randomized trials concerning lumbar supports were consistently negative, there is strong evidence that they are not effective in prevention. Exercises, conversely, showed stable positive results in randomized controlled trials, giving consistent evidence of relatively moderate utility in prevention. Because no properly controlled trials were found for ergonomic interventions or risk factor modification, there was not good quality evidence available to draw a conclusion. Conclusions: The results concerning prevention for subjects not seeking medical care are sobering. Only exercises provided sufficient evidence to conclude that they are an effective preventive intervention. There is a dire lack of controlled trials examining broad-based multidimensional programs.

Secondary analyses from primary preventive studies suggest benefit among workers with previous low back pain, but definitive studies on the effectiveness of supports for the secondary prevention of low back pain are lacking. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of lumbar supports in the secondary prevention of low back pain. Design: Randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Home care organization in the Netherlands. Patients: 360 home care workers with self-reported history of low back pain. Intervention: Short course on healthy working methods, with or without patient-directed use of 1 of 4 types of lumbar support. Measurements: Primary outcomes were the number of days of low back pain and sick leave over 12 months. Secondary outcomes were the average severity of low back pain and function (Quebec Back Pain Disability scale) in the previous week. Results: Over 12 months, participants in the lumbar support group reported an average of -52.7 days (CI, -59.6 to -45.1 days) fewer days with low back pain than participants who received only the short course. However, the total sick days in the lumbar support group did not decrease (-5 days [CI, -21.1 to 6.8 days]). Small but statistically significant differences in pain intensity and function favored lumbar support. Limitations: Study participants were unblinded, and a substantial amount of missing data required imputation. Objective data on sick days due to low back pain were not available.

Overall the methodological quality of the studies included in our review was rather low. Only four of the thirteen studies scored positive on 50% or more of the the internal validity items. There was moderate evidence that for primary prevention lumbar supports are not more effective than other types of treatment or no intervention. No evidence was found on the effectiveness of lumbar supports for secondary prevention. The systematic review of therapeutic trials showed that there is limited evidence that lumbar supports are more effective than no treatment, while it is still unclear if lumbar supports are more effective than other interventions for treatment of low back pain.

17,2019,30651407,"Low back pain (LBP) is a common problem in manufacturing workers. Several strategies have been proposed in order to reduce the pain and/or improve functionality. Among them, lumbar supports are a common solution prescribed for lumbar pain relief. Most of the studies in the literature only consider subjective sensations of the workers for evaluation assessment. This study applies biomechanical tests (a flexion-relaxation test and a functional movement evaluation test) to analyse the effectiveness of flexible lumbar supports in functionality and disability versus placebo intervention, consisting of kinesiotape placed on the low back without any stress. 28 workers participated in the study, randomised in control and intervention groups with a two months' intervention.

However, few randomized, controlled trials allow practitioners to evaluate the evidence base for this practice. The purpose of this article is to determine, based on a review of the literature, whether adequate evidence exists to support the use of electrical stimulation as a treatment of male urinary incontinence. Urge, stress, and overflow incontinence are evaluated separately. This review led to 3 conclusions: (1) theoretical and urodynamic evidence exists to support the use of electrical stimulation for urge incontinence, (2) conflicting evidence exists in the use of electrical stimulation for stress urinary incontinence, and (3) treatment of overflow incontinence in men has not been evaluated in a systematic way. For both stress urinary or overflow incontinence, practitioners should consider the existing research before recommending electrical stimulation as a first line of treatment.

18,2019,9065281,"Objectives: To evaluate the urodynamic results achieved by electrostimulation in patients with different types of urinary incontinence. Methods: 37 patients (32 females and 5 males) with urinary incontinence were treated with peripheral electrical stimulation. The urodynamic diagnosis were: detrusor instability (24.3%), stress urinary incontinence (24.3%), mixed urinary incontinence (48.6%), and bladder hyper-reflexia (2.7%). Rectal and vaginal electrodes were utilized. The therapeutic frequencies were 10 Hz, 20 Hz and 50 Hz. Results: Detrusor instability disappeared in the cases treated with the 10 Hz frequency (79%) and in one case treated with the 50 Hz frequency. A significantly increased bladder capacity and decreased first micturition sensation were observed in this patient group. All patients with stress urinary incontinence were treated with high frequency (50 Hz), which achieved positive results in 44%. In the group of patients with mixed urinary incontinence. 45% remained unchanged. Treatment failed to achieve satisfactory results in the single case of detrusor hyperreflexia in this series. Conclusion: Peripheral electrical stimulation is a valid alternative in the treatment of male and female incontinence.

18,2019,23740763,"Background: Electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices is used for patients with different types of urinary incontinence and symptoms of urgency, frequency and nocturia. The current review focused on electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices for the treatment of urinary incontinence in men. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices for men with stress, urgency or mixed urinary incontinence in comparison with no treatment, placebo treatment, or any other 'single' treatment. Additionally, the effectiveness of electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices in combination with another intervention was compared with the other intervention alone. Finally, the effectiveness of one method of electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices was compared with another method. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 21 January 2012). We also searched other electronic and non-electronic bibliographic databases and the reference lists of the included studies as well as contacting researchers in the field to identify other relevant trials. Selection criteria: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed all the identified trials for eligibility. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for determining bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, and a third review author was involved in the case of no consensus. Data were analysed using Cochrane methods. Main results: Six randomized controlled trials (five full papers and one abstract) were included. There was considerable variation in the interventions used, study protocols, types of electrical stimulation parameters and devices, study populations and outcome measures. In total 544 men were included, of whom 305 received some form of electrical stimulation, and 239 a control or comparator treatment. The trials were mostly small and generally there was not sufficient information to assess risk of bias; only two trials used secure methods of randomization.There was some evidence that electrical stimulation (ES) had a short-term effect in reducing incontinence compared with sham treatment (for example risk ratio (RR) at six months 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.87) but not at 12 months. Four trials evaluated the effect of adding PFMT to ES versus pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) alone or with biofeedback. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the number of men with urinary incontinence at three months (146/239, 61% for combined treatment versus 98/156, 63% with PFMT alone; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.06). However, there were more adverse effects with combined treatment (23/139, 17% versus 2/99, 2% with PFMT alone; RR 7.04, 95% CI 1.51 to 32.94) and quality of life also seemed better with PFMT alone. One small trial did not detect statistically significant differences between two methods of administration of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (anal versus perineal) but the quality of life score was lower (better) in the anal stimulation group. Authors' conclusions: There was some evidence that electrical stimulation enhanced the effect of PFMT in the short term but not after six months.

18,2019,28188756,"Objective: To investigate the therapeutic effect and underlying molecular mechanism of electrical stimulation (ES) in a murine stress urinary incontinence (SUI) model. Materials and methods: Sixty female C57BL/6 mice were divided into 4 groups: CON group, no intervention; VD group, vaginal distension (VD) with an 8-mm dilator for 1 hour; VD + ES 20 group, 20 Hz ES for 0.5 hour for 7 days after VD; and VD + ES 50 group, 50 Hz ES for 7 days after VD. For functional studies, assessments of urodynamics and sneezing test were performed; then, anterior vaginal wall specimens were collected. Pathological changes were validated by Masson's trichrome and Van Gieson staining, and the expressions of collagen, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-Smad2/3 pathway components, and T-type calcium channels were detected by Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: ES significantly increased maximum bladder capacity, leak point pressure, and sneezing positive rate in SUI mice. The staining results showed that collagen was disorganized in the VD group but became organized after ES, especially at 50 Hz. The same results were found for collagens I and III. The expression of TGF-β1, p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 significantly decreased in the VD group and significantly increased in the VD + ES groups, especially in the VD + ES 50 group. The expression of 2 T-type calcium channel subtypes (Cav 3.1 and Cav 3.2) decreased in the VD group compared with the CON group, but increased in the VD + ES group compared with the VD group. Conclusion: Dysregulation of collagen metabolism is involved in the pathogenesis of SUI. ES can ameliorate the symptoms of SUI by activating collagen regeneration through the TGFβ1-Smad2/3 pathway. T-type calcium channels might be involved in these processes.",Can electrical stimulation devices treat male urinary incontinence?,electrical stimulation male urinary incontinence,0.0,Can electrical stimulation devices treat male urinary incontinence?,0.9718705415725708

18,2019,20850831,"Purpose: We evaluated electrical stimulation combined with pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy in a randomized controlled study. Materials and methods: A total of 56 men with severe urinary incontinence (more than 200 gm daily), mean ± SD age 66.6 ± 6.2 years, were randomized to an active treatment group (26) or a sham group (30). All patients performed pelvic floor muscle training preoperatively and continued throughout the study. For active stimulation 50 Hz square waves of 300 μs pulse duration and a 5 seconds on, 5 seconds off duty cycle were applied for 15 minutes twice daily with an anal electrode. Sham stimulation was limited to 3 mA with a 2 seconds on, 13 seconds off duty cycle. Results: In the active group 8 (36%), 14 (63%), 18 (81%) and 19 (86%) patients were continent (22) vs 1 (4%), 4 (16%), 11 (44%) and 17 (86%) in the sham group (25) (leakage less than 8 gm daily) after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. There was a significant difference in the number of continent patients between the groups at 1, 3 and 6 months (p = 0.0161, p = 0.0021 and p = 0.0156, respectively). The time to achieve continence was significantly shorter in the active group (2.71 ± 2.6 months) than in the sham group (6.82 ± 3.9 months, p = 0.0006). Changes in the amount of leakage, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form score and the King's Health Questionnaire score were significantly larger in the active group at 1 month but there was no difference at 12 months.

It includes several techniques that can be used to improve stress, urge, and mixed symptoms. However, the magnitude of the alleged benefits is not completely established. Objectives: To determine the effects of electrical stimulation in women with symptoms or urodynamic diagnoses of stress, urge, and mixed incontinence. Search strategy: Our review included articles published between January 1980 and January 2012. We used the search terms ″urinary incontinence″, ″electrical stimulation ″, ″ intravaginal ″, ″ tibial nerve ″ and ″ neuromodulation ″ for studies including female patients. Selection criteria: We evaluated randomized trials that included electrical stimulation in at least one arm of the trial, to treat women with urinary incontinence. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed the data from the trials, for inclusion or exclusion, and methodological analysis. Main results: A total of 30 randomized clinical trials were included. Most of the trials involved intravaginal electrical stimulation. Intravaginal electrical stimulation showed effectiveness in treating urge urinary incontinence, but reported contradictory data regarding stress and mixed incontinence. Tibial-nerve stimulation showed promising results in randomized trials with a short follow-up period. Sacral-nerve stimulation yielded interesting results in refractory patients. Conclusions: Tibial-nerve and intravaginal stimulation have shown effectiveness in treating urge urinary incontinence. Sacral-nerve stimulation provided benefits in refractory cases. Presently available data provide no support for the use of intravaginal electrical stimulation to treat stress urinary incontinence in women.

Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing honey given alone, or in combination with antibiotics, versus nothing, placebo or other over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications to participants aged from one to 18 years for acute cough in ambulatory settings. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened search results for eligible studies and extracted data on reported outcomes. Main results: We included three RCTs, two at high risk of bias and one at low risk of bias, involving 568 children. The studies compared honey with dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, 'no treatment' and placebo for the effect on symptomatic relief of cough using a seven-point Likert scale. The lower the score, the better the cough symptom being assessed.Moderate quality evidence showed that honey may be better than 'no treatment' in reducing the frequency of cough (mean difference (MD) -1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.48 to -0.62; I(2) statistic 23%; two studies, 154 participants). High quality evidence also suggests that honey may be better than placebo for reduction of cough frequency (MD -1.85; 95% Cl -3.36 to -0.33; one study, 300 participants). Moderate quality evidence suggests that honey does not differ significantly from dextromethorphan in reducing cough frequency (MD -0.07; 95% CI -1.07 to 0.94; two studies, 149 participants). Low quality evidence suggests that honey may be slightly better than diphenhydramine in reducing cough frequency (MD -0.57; 95% CI -0.90 to -0.24; one study, 80 participants).Adverse events included mild reactions (nervousness, insomnia and hyperactivity) experienced by seven children (9.3%) from the honey group and two (2.7%) from the dextromethorphan group; the difference was not significant (risk ratio (RR) 2.94; 95% Cl 0.74 to 11.71; two studies, 149 participants). Three children (7.5%) in the diphenhydramine group experienced somnolence (RR 0.14; 95% Cl 0.01 to 2.68; one study, 80 participants). When honey was compared with placebo, four children (1.8%) in the honey group and one (1.3%) from the placebo group complained of gastrointestinal symptoms (RR 1.33; 95% Cl 0.15 to 11.74). However, there was no significant difference between honey versus dextromethorphan, honey versus diphenhydramine or honey versus placebo. No adverse event was reported in the 'no treatment' group. Authors' conclusions: Honey may be better than 'no treatment', diphenhydramine and placebo for the symptomatic relief of cough, but it is not better than dextromethorphan.

19,2019,32840151,"Honey is a natural product that has been used as medication since the ancient times for its nutritive and therapeutic value. Despite these properties, honey use has been limited in evidence-based medicine due to the lack of evidence in clinical settings, particularly in paediatric population.

We performed a literature search to summarise the highest quality evidences, analysed articles regarding honey's nutritional properties and therapeutic value. The state of the art is represented by evidences related to beneficiary effects of honey on respiratory, gastroenterological and oncohaematologic diseases. Many other uses could promisingly come from in vitro studies or clinical trial based on adult samples. Honey shows an excellent risk-benefit profile and can be safely administrated in children older than 12 months.

19,2019,36126325,"Background and objective: Cough from URTI is common, leads to discomfort, sleep loss and stress in caregivers, leading to use of ineffective and potentially harmful over-the-counter medications. Honey is cost-effective and safe for children above one year of age. It is readily available and is a potentially valuable demulcent for treatment of childhood cough. The study aimed to determine the effect of honey on cough frequency and severity among children with URTI in outpatient setting. Methods: A single-blind randomised control trial involving children presenting with cough from URTI attending the GOPC of FMC Keffi. Eighty-four children presenting with cough from URTI were recruited, randomised into two groups of 42 and administered Honey (intervention) and Diphenhydramine (control) in three consecutive bedtime doses. Socio-demographic and clinical data including cough frequency, severity and impact on children and caregivers was collected using Paediatric Cough Questionnaire and Kingston Caregiver Stress Scale tool. Data was analysed using SPSS version 25. A p 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Majority (56.0%) of the participants were males, with a mean age +SD of 4±1.47 years. Median cough frequency score for intervention and control groups pre and post intervention decreased (5.00 and 0.00 vs 5.00 and 3.00, p 0.001).

19,2019,23904963,Respiratory tract infections are an important health problem because of high incidence and economic costs. The World Health Organization identifies honey as a potential demulcent treatment for cough. The aim of this study is to determine: i) patient public perceptions towards a proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effects of honey to placebo for treatment of cough in children; ii) potential participation rates for proposed trial; iii) whether age and gender of parent or child impacts on proposed cough assessment tools. Forty adult participants with children age 1-6 years presenting with an upper respiratory tract infection were enrolled. They underwent a structured interview regarding the proposed trial and assessed their child's cough using two validated questionnaires. Eighty-eight percent of those recruited were willing to participate in the proposed trial. The two independently validated cough scores correlated well. A relationship between age and gender of child or parent with cough assessment score was not found. We conclude that a RCT to determine the effects of honey versus placebo is feasible.

19,2019,32929686,"Cough is a widespread symptom in children and adolescents. Despite advances in scientific knowledge about the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the cough reflex, the best therapeutic approaches for children and adolescents who cough remain unclear, and many needs are still unmet. Many remedies for cough are self-prescribed, reflecting strong demand, but significant evidence of their efficacy and safety is missing in pediatric populations. Moreover, as most coughs are part of self-limited illnesses, treatment could be considered unnecessary in some patients. Drug therapy to relieve cough and other symptoms is an essential part of treating a child with cough. However, unfortunately, the number of studies in each category of cough medications is minimal, and dosing and treatment duration varies significantly among studies. Some treatments have been shown to be no more effective than placebo. Lack of clear indications for dosing and treatment duration, the number of available drugs, the numerous active ingredients in products, and multiple caregivers administering medication to children have been considered contributors to an increased risk of inappropriate prescribing, accidental overdosing, and adverse events. This review presents the most recent evidence on the safety and efficacy of available cough remedies, focusing on the pediatric age group, and includes H 1 receptor antagonists, mucolytics and expectorants, drugs acting peripherally on the cough reflex, drugs acting centrally on the cough reflex, drugs acting both peripherally and centrally on the cough reflex, and other compounds, including menthol, glycerol, honey, and medical devices composed of complex natural substances.

20,2019,9310974,"Objective: The second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study demonstrated that there were neurological benefits from ""spinal cord injury"" doses of methylprednisolone for blunt spinal cord injuries. In this review, we examined the relative risk/benefit ratio of intravenously treating spinal gunshot wound victims with steroids. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of 254 consecutive patients who were treated between 1979 and 1994 for gunshot wounds to the spine (C1-L1) and a spinal cord injury. Three subgroups were established based on the administration of the steroids methylprednisolone (National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study 2 protocol), dexamethasone (initial dose, 10-100 mg), and no steroids. All patients who received steroids were initially treated at another hospital and then transferred. No patients received steroids at our institution. The data analyzed included neurological outcome and infectious and noninfectious complications. Results: No statistically significant neurological benefits were demonstrable from the use of steroids (methylprednisolone, dexamethasone). Infectious complications were increased in both groups receiving steroids (not statistically significant). Gastrointestinal complications were significantly increased in the dexamethasone group (P = 0.021), and pancreatitis was significantly increased in the methylprednisolone group (P = 0.040). The mean duration of follow-up was 56.3 months. Conclusion: In this retrospective, nonrandomized review, no neurological benefits were detectable from intravenously administered steroids after a gunshot wound to the spine. Both infectious and noninfectious complication rates were higher in the groups receiving steroids. Patients who sustain a spinal cord injury secondary to a gunshot wound to the spine should not be treated with steroids until the efficacy of such treatment is proven in a controlled study.",Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,0.5874660611152649
20,2019,6766574,Steroids are commonly used in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury patients although a review of the literature fails to define a consistent regimen for administration with regard to optimal preparation or dosage or schedule. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of exogenous steroids on the outcome of experimental spinal cord injury and the effect of experimental spinal cord injury on endogenous cortisol production. Thirty female rhesus monkeys received a 660 gm cm lesion to the T10 spinal cord. They were randomly placed into one of six groups of five animals each. Two groups were controls used to assess the endogenous cortisol response to spinal cord injury. These animals received no steroids. The other four groups received one of two commonly used steroid preparations. All animals were evaluated serially for neurological status using motor testing and for general physical status. Serial cortisol determinations were obtained for an eight-week post injury period. The steroid groups showed some benefit from treatment when compared to the untreated controls. There were no significant differences in physical condition between treated and control groups. Of special interest was the response of endogenous cortisol production to spinal cord injury. Early cortisol elevation following injury peaked by eight hours and then precipitously dropped to baseline levels before 24 hours following injury.,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,0.9654262661933899

Summary of background data: There remains significant debate over clinical benefits and potential complications of the steroid protocol for SCI patients. Methods: A survey was sent to spine surgeons requesting information on 1) specialization, 2) trauma center affiliation, 3) use of steroid protocol, 4) justification of using steroid protocol, and 5) SCI volume. Results: Responses were received from 305 surgeons. Fourteen (4.6%) surgeons used steroids only if initiated before their consult, 262 (85.9%) would initiate if within the accepted 8-hour timeframe, 20 (6.6%) did not use steroids at all, and 9 (3.0%) used a different protocol. Justification for steroids use: 65 improved recovery, 64 institutional protocol, 110 medicolegal reasons, and 26 did not personally initiate steroids. Eighteen surgeons listed both clinical benefit and institutional protocol, and 22 others listed both institutional protocol and medicolegal reasons. Conclusions: The majority (90.5%) of responding surgeons used the steroid protocol; however, only 24.1% used the steroid protocol due to a belief in improved clinical outcomes.",Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,0.9554949402809143
20,2019,8215634,"Objective: In 1990, large-dose steroid administration was advocated in spine-injured patients to lessen neurologic deficits. The authors undertook both prospective and retrospective studies to evaluate the response of such profound pharmacologic intervention. Summary background data: Of all sources of nonfatal injury, spinal cord trauma remains the most devastating in both cost and impact on the quality of the patient's life. One study found that routine large-dose steroid administration after injury lessened the extent of neurologic injury. After uncommonly prompt and broad lay press publicity, this practice was widely accepted. Biased by knowledge of the known immunosuppressive effects of steroids, the authors suspected that pneumonia was both more frequent and severe in steroid-treated patients. Methods: Thirty-two patients with cervical or upper thoracic spinal injuries (C3-6, 20 patients; C6-7, 6 patients; and T1-6, 6 patients) were studied at an urban level I trauma center from January 1987 to February 1993. Complete spinal cord injury was present in 22 of 32 patients; 14 patients received steroids postinjury. There was no difference in mean age, cord level, age-adjusted injury severity score, or the percent of injury severity score caused by the spinal injury. Results: The length of hospital stay was longer in steroid-treated patients (S) than in nonsteroid (NS) patients, that is, 44.4 days versus 27.7 days, respectively (p = 0.065). Seventy-nine per cent of S patients had pneumonia compared with 50% of NS patients (p = 0.614). There was no statistical difference in the episodes of pneumonia per patient between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). Prospectively, the authors evaluated sequentially several parameters known to be important in human immune responses to bacterial challenges in nine S and five NS patients. In S patients, both the per cent and density of monocyte class II antigen expression and T-helper/suppressor cell ratios were lower than in NS patients. However, S patients did have an initially higher, earlier boost in some host defense parameters that rapidly declined, and their subsequent response was both blunted and delayed. These differences became even clearer when stratified according to cord level and incomplete versus complete cord status. Not surprisingly, infected patients, whether S or NS, had lower levels of monocyte antigen expression, CR3, and helper/suppressor ratios. Conclusions: These data do not permit a judgment to be made whether neurologic status was improved by S administration. It is known that vital immune responses were adversely affected, that pneumonia was somewhat more prevalent, and that hospitalization was prolonged and costs therefore increased by an average of $51,504 per admission.

20,2019,20493656,"Background: The diagnosis and management of cervical spine injury is more complex in children than in adults. Objectives: Part I of this series stressed the importance of tailoring the evaluation of cervical spine injuries based on age, mechanism of injury, and physical examination findings. Part II will discuss the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as the management of pediatric cervical spine injuries in the emergency department. Discussion: Children have several common variations in their anatomy, such as pseudosubluxation of C2-C3, widening of the atlantodens interval, and ossification centers, that can appear concerning on imaging but are normal. Physicians should be alert for signs or symptoms of atlantorotary subluxation and spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormality when treating children with spinal cord injury, as these conditions have significant morbidity. MRI can identify injuries to the spinal cord that are not apparent with other modalities, and should be used when a child presents with a neurologic deficit but normal X-ray study or CT scan.

One of the most widely practiced treatments has been the administration of methylprednisolone. However, today its use has been called into question over concerns of efficacy and safety. The present study evaluated the changes in the practice of steroid administration in acute SCI among members of the National Spinal Society in Poland in comparison with the results of the survey conducted in 2013. Methods: The questionnaire, comprising 5 questions, was distributed among 240 spinal surgeons, members of the Polish Society of Spinal Surgery; of these, 97 (40%) responded. The results were compared with data from the previous survey conducted in 2013. Results: Over a period of 5 years, the prevalence of steroid administration in acute SCI has completely reversed; the proportion of steroid users declined from 73% to 27%. The main rationale for using it was belief in efficacy, rather than fear of litigation. The differences between specialization and age groups were not statistically significant in both administrations. Conclusions: A significant decrease was observed in the number of surgeons using steroids in the acute SCI, similar to that reported in the literature.

Design: A consensus committee of 27 experts was formed. A formal conflict-of-interest (COI) policy was developed at the outset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independently of any industrial funding (i.e. pharmaceutical, medical devices). The authors were advised to follow the rules of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE®) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence. The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasised. Methods: The committee studied twelve questions: (1) What are the indications and arrangements for spinal immobilisation? (2) What are the arrangements for pre-hospital orotracheal intubation? (3) What are the objectives of haemodynamic resuscitation during the lesion assessment, and during the first few days in hospital? (4) What is the best way to manage these patients to improve their long-term prognosis? (5) What is the place of corticosteroid therapy in the initial phase? (6) What are the indications for magnetic resonance imaging in the lesion assessment phase? (7) What is the optimal time for surgical management? (8) What are the best arrangements for orotracheal intubation in the hospital environment? (9) What are the specific conditions for weaning these patients from mechanical ventilation for?

Hydroxyzine, an antagonist of histamine receptors, showed both efficacy and safety in previous short-term double-blind studies over placebo in this pathology. The aim of the current study was to confirm those positive results over a 3-month period in adult outpatients. Method: This multicenter, parallel (hydroxyzine [50 mg/day]; bromazepam [6 mg/day]), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 2 weeks of single-blind run-in placebo, 12 weeks of double-blind randomized treatment, and 4 weeks of single-blind run-out placebo. Three hundred thirty-four of 369 selected outpatients with a diagnosis of GAD according to DSM-IV criteria and a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score &gt;/= 20 were randomized before entering the double-blind period. The primary outcome criterion was the change in the HAM-A score from baseline to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with hydroxyzine compared with placebo. Results: In the intent-to-treat analysis, the mean +/- SD change in HAM-A scores from baseline to endpoint was -12.16 +/- 7.74 for hydroxyzine and -9.64 +/- 7.74 for placebo (p =.019). Results at endpoint for percentage of responders (p =.003) and remission rates (p =.028), Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale score (p =.001), maintenance of efficacy (p =.022), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale score on day 84 (p =.008) also confirmed the efficacy of hydroxyzine over placebo. The study showed no statistically significant difference between hydroxyzine and bromazepam.

22,2019,7875114,"A multi-centre study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxyzine in the treatment of patients presenting a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). One hundred and thirty three patients, suffering from a GAD (according to DSM III-R criteria with 6 months duration criteria), were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind, hydroxyzine (50 mg/day) versus placebo, over a 4-week trial period. By the end of the first week, the decrease of anxiety scores was significant for the hydroxyzine group, as compared to placebo (in respect of all rating criteria of anxiety). The statistical superiority for hydroxyzine continued to the end of the 4-weeks study period, and persisted at a further evaluation a week after abrupt discontinuation of active treatment. The tolerance evaluation showed that side effects were reported in 52% of hydroxyzine group versus 35% of placebo group. The most commun side effects were sleepiness (28% vs 14% with placebo), weight gain (12% vs 10%), dry mouth (14% vs 5%), loss of concentration (9% vs 8%) and insomnia (9% vs 6%). Sleepiness in the hydroxyzine group appeared during the first week and progressively disappeared later during treatment. We concluded that hydroxyzine at 50 mg/day produces a statistically and clinically significant anxiolytic effect, commencing during the first week of treatment and maintained throughout the 4-week period and after abrupt discontinuation without rebound of anxiety or withdrawal symptoms.

22,2019,21154375,"Background: Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common chronic long-term psychiatric disorder, particularly frequent in primary care. There are several treatment options available, both non-pharmacological (i.e. cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological. Among the pharmacological interventions, antidepressants, buspirone and benzodiazepines (BDZs) have been studied in GAD. Hydroxyzine is an anti-histamine medication which has been used in the treatment of anxiety. Objectives: 1. To determine the efficacy of hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent in alleviating the acute symptoms of GAD. 2. To review acceptability of treatment with hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent. 3. To investigate the adverse effects of hydroxyzine in comparison with other active agents. Search strategy: The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched on 1 March 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO and checked reference lists of included studies, previous systematic reviews and major textbooks of anxiety disorders. Personal communication with pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field was also undertaken. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with GAD to hydroxyzine versus placebo and/or any other anxiolytic agent. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (such as the number of patients who responded to treatment or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side effect profile). Main results: The search yielded 39 studies. We included five studies in the review with a total of 884 participants. We excluded 31 studies and designated three as awaiting assessment. The data from the included studies provide some evidence that hydroxyzine is more effective than placebo for GAD (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58) and that it is also acceptable/tolerable (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.58) (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.40). Compared to other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability (hydroxyzine vs chloridiazepoxide: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.62; hydroxyzine vs buspirone efficacy OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.42). In terms of side effects, hydroxyzine was associated with a higher rate of sleepiness/drowsiness than the active comparators (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.53). There was, however, a high risk of bias in the included studies. Authors' conclusions: The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol for this review. Even though more effective than placebo, due to the high risk of bias of the included studies, the small number of studies and the overall small sample size, it is not possible to recommend hydroxyzine as a reliable first-line treatment in GAD.",How effective is hydroxyzine (also known as Atarax) for treating generalized anxiety disorder?,hydroxyzine generalized anxiety disorder,0.0,How effective is hydroxyzine (also known as Atarax) for treating generalized anxiety disorder?,0.7084817290306091

During this time, we observed a clear dose-response pattern of gabapentin on GAD symptoms.

22,2019,7781586,"The aim of this randomized, double-blind, multicentric study was to assess and compare cognitive impairment in patients treated with either lorazepam or hydroxyzine, for generalized anxiety. Only non depressed patients were selected according to MADRS criteria. The cognitive assessment was performed with the BEC 96 rating scale, the intensity of anxiety symptoms was evaluated through the Hamilton-anxiety and Covi scales. The level of relation, mood and sedation was assessed for each item with a visual analog scale (VAS). The patient's and investigator's opinion on the global efficiency of the treatment were also evaluated on VAS. After an 8-day wash-out period under placebo, the treatment was given in a double-blind way for 28 days: either hydroxyzine 25 mg at a daily dosage of 100 mg t.i.d. (25 mg - 25 mg - 50 mg), or lorazepam 1 mg at a daily dosage of 4 mg t.i.d. (1 mg - 1 mg - 2 mg). The results were as follows: after the 28-day treatment period, patients showed at the BEC 96 a cognitive improvement in both groups, but the improvement in the hydroxyzine group was significantly higher. Furthermore, the improvement appeared more quickly in the hydroxyzine group. The Hamilton-anxiety and Covi scales showed an improvement in the anxiety level in both groups with no significant difference. The visual analog scales assessing relation, mood and sedation improved in both groups as well as the patient's and investigator's opinion. The five assessments all showed a significant by higher improvement in the hydroxyzine group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",How effective is hydroxyzine (also known as Atarax) for treating generalized anxiety disorder?,hydroxyzine generalized anxiety disorder,0.0,How effective is hydroxyzine (also known as Atarax) for treating generalized anxiety disorder?,0.9361698627471924
22,2019,23671484,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common and serious disease with a lifetime prevalence of 4.3% to 5.9%. It is underdiagnosed in primary care. Methods: Recommendations on the treatment of GAD are given on the basis of all available findings from pertinent randomized trials, retrieved by a selective search of the literature. Results: Among psychotherapeutic techniques, various kinds of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have been found useful in controlled trials. The drugs of first choice include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and the calcium-channel modulator pregabalin. Tricyclic antidepressants are also effective but have more adverse effects than SSRIs. Although benzodiazepines are effective anxiolytic agents for short-term use, they should not be given over the long term because of the danger of addiction. Buspirone, an azapirone, was found to be effective in a small number of trials, but the findings across trials are inconsistent. The response rate of GAD to CBT in published studies lies between 47% and 75%, while its response rate to drug treatment lies between 44% and 81%. Conclusion: The treatment of GAD with CBT and drugs is evidence-based and has a good chance of improving the manifestations of the disorder.",How effective is hydroxyzine (also known as Atarax) for treating generalized anxiety disorder?,hydroxyzine generalized anxiety disorder,0.0,How effective is hydroxyzine (also known as Atarax) for treating generalized anxiety disorder?,0.9187566041946411
27,2019,30062732,"Background: Cough is a frequent symptom presenting to doctors. The most common cause of childhood chronic (greater than fours weeks' duration) wet cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in some settings, although other more serious causes can also present this way. Timely and effective management of chronic wet or productive cough improves quality of life and clinical outcomes. Current international guidelines suggest a course of antibiotics is the first treatment of choice in the absence of signs or symptoms specific to an alternative diagnosis. This review sought to clarify the current evidence to support this recommendation. Objectives: To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with prolonged wet cough (excluding children with bronchiectasis or other known underlying respiratory illness) and to assess risk of harm due to adverse events. Search methods: We undertook an updated search (from 2008 onwards) using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, trials registries, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest searches were performed in September 2017. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic wet cough. We excluded cluster and cross-over trials. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane. We reviewed results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two independent review authors selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors of eligible studies for further information as needed. We analysed data as 'intention to treat.' Main results: We identified three studies as eligible for inclusion in the review. Two were in the previous review and one new study was included. We considered the older studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias whereas we judged the newly included study at low risk of bias. The studies varied in treatment duration (from 7 to 14 days) and the antibiotic used (two studies used amoxicillin/clavulanate acid and one used erythromycin).We included 190 children (171 completed), mean ages ranged from 21 months to six years, in the meta-analyses. Analysis of all three trials (190 children) found that treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31, using intention-to -treat analysis), which translated to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). We identified no significant heterogeneity (for both fixed-effect and random-effects model the I² statistic was 0%). Two older trials assessed progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics (125 children), which was significantly lower in the antibiotic group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.34; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). All three trials (190 children) reported adverse events, which were not significantly increased in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.69). We assessed the quality of evidence GRADE rating as moderate for all outcome measures, except adverse events which we assessed as low quality. Authors' conclusions: Evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious for the treatment of children with chronic wet cough (greater than four weeks) with an NNTB of three. However, antibiotics have adverse effects and this review reported only uncertainty as to the risk of increased adverse effects when they were used in this setting. The inclusion of a more robust study strengthened the previous Cochrane review and its results.",Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,0.1814935803413391
27,2019,31496125,"Background: Chronic wet cough is common in pediatric pulmonology practice and is clinically important. Guidelines recommend treatment with antibiotics as their effectiveness has been proven. However, factors associated with duration of cough in response to antibiotics in children with chronic wet cough have not been prospectively examined. Objective: To determine if demographic, clinical and/or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) factors are associated with ""time to cough resolution"" in children with chronic wet cough treated with antibiotics after bronchoscopy. Methods: Data from children with chronic wet cough treated with antibiotics after bronchoscopy were extracted from a prospective cohort study database. Cough dairies were used to determine when the cough resolved. Associations between various factors with ""time to cough resolution"" were examined using regression. Results: The median age of the 133 children was 2.4 years (interquartile range, 1.4-4.9). Duration of prior cough at bronchoscopy was significantly positively related with ""time to cough resolution"" (β = .010; 95% confidence interval, 0.004-0.017; P = .002). This translated to; for each month of prior cough, it took an extra 1.02 days to achieve cough resolution while on antibiotic treatment. Gender, age, diagnosis, tobacco smoke exposure, pneumonia history, blood cellularity, and BAL cellular and microbiology profiles were not significantly associated with time to cough resolution. Conclusion: In children with chronic wet cough, duration of cough before antibiotic treatment is a small but significant determinant of ""time to cough resolution.""

27,2019,26757284,"Background: Systematic reviews were conducted to examine two related key questions (KQs) in children with chronic (&gt; 4 weeks' duration) wet or productive cough not related to bronchiectasis: KQ1-How effective are antibiotics in improving the resolution of cough? If so, what antibiotic should be used and for how long? KQ2-When should they be referred for further investigations? Methods: The systematic reviews were undertaken based on the protocol established by selected members of the CHEST expert cough panel. Two authors screened searches and selected and extracted data. The study included systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort (prospective and retrospective) studies, and cross-sectional studies published in English. Results: Data were presented in Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flowcharts, and the summaries were tabulated. Fifteen studies were included in KQ1 (three systematic reviews, three RCTs, five prospective studies, and four retrospective studies) and 17 in KQ2 (one RCT, 11 prospective studies, and five retrospective studies). Combining data from the RCTs (KQ1), the number needed to treat for benefit was 3 (95% CI, 2.0-4.3) in achieving cough resolution. In general, findings from prospective and retrospective studies were consistent, but there were minor variations. Conclusions: There is high-quality evidence that in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (&gt; 4 weeks' duration) wet or productive cough, the use of appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution. There is also high-quality evidence that when specific cough pointers (eg, digital clubbing) are present in children with wet cough, further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be conducted. When the wet cough does not improve by 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, there is moderate-quality evidence that children should be referred to a major center for further investigations to determine whether an underlying lung or other disease is present.",Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,0.6972503066062927
27,2019,31515408,"These guidelines incorporate the recent advances in chronic cough pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. The concept of cough hypersensitivity has allowed an umbrella term that explains the exquisite sensitivity of patients to external stimuli such a cold air, perfumes, smoke and bleach. Thus, adults with chronic cough now have a firm physical explanation for their symptoms based on vagal afferent hypersensitivity. Different treatable traits exist with cough variant asthma (CVA)/eosinophilic bronchitis responding to anti-inflammatory treatment and non-acid reflux being treated with promotility agents rather the anti-acid drugs. An alternative antitussive strategy is to reduce hypersensitivity by neuromodulation. Low-dose morphine is highly effective in a subset of patients with cough resistant to other treatments. Gabapentin and pregabalin are also advocated, but in clinical experience they are limited by adverse events. Perhaps the most promising future developments in pharmacotherapy are drugs which tackle neuronal hypersensitivity by blocking excitability of afferent nerves by inhibiting targets such as the ATP receptor (P2X3). Finally, cough suppression therapy when performed by competent practitioners can be highly effective. Children are not small adults and a pursuit of an underlying cause for cough is advocated. Thus, in toddlers, inhalation of a foreign body is common. Persistent bacterial bronchitis is a common and previously unrecognised cause of wet cough in children. Antibiotics (drug, dose and duration need to be determined) can be curative.

27,2019,28143696,"Background: Wet or productive cough is common in children with chronic cough. We formulated recommendations based on systematic reviews related to the management of chronic wet cough in children (aged ≤ 14 years) based on two key questions: (1) how effective are antibiotics in improving the resolution of cough? If so, what antibiotic should be used and for how long? and (2) when should children be referred for further investigations? Methods: We used the CHEST expert cough panel's protocol for systematic reviews and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and GRADE framework (the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus for the recommendations/suggestions made. Results: Combining data from the systematic reviews, we found high-quality evidence in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (&gt; 4 weeks' duration) wet/productive cough that using appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution, and further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be undertaken when specific cough pointers (eg, digital clubbing) are present. When the wet cough does not improve following 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, there is moderate-quality evidence that further investigations should be considered to look for an underlying disease. New recommendations include the recognition of the clinical diagnostic entity of protracted bacterial bronchitis. Conclusions: Compared with the 2006 Cough Guidelines, there is now high-quality evidence for some, but not all, aspects of the management of chronic wet cough in specialist settings.

27,2019,24521788,"Aim: To determine whether a child with chronic wet cough and poor response to at least 4 weeks of oral antibiotics is more likely to have bronchiectasis. Methods: All chest multi-detector computerised tomography (MDCT) scans at a single paediatric tertiary hospital from April 2010 to August 2012 were reviewed retrospectively so as to identify those ordered by respiratory physicians for assessment of children with a chronic wet cough. Information regarding age, sex, ethnicity, indication for imaging and the response to at least 4 weeks of antibiotics before having the scan were recorded from their charts. The data were analysed using simple and multiple logistic regression. Results: Of the 144 (87 males) eligible children, 106 (65 males, 30 Indigenous) aged 10-199 months had MDCT scan evidence of bronchiectasis. Antibiotic data were available for 129 children. Among the 105 children with persistent cough despite at least 4 weeks of antibiotics, 88 (83.8%) had bronchiectasis, while of the 24 children whose cough resolved after antibiotics, only six (25.0%) received this diagnosis (adjusted OR 20.9; 95% CI 5.36 to 81.8). Being Indigenous was also independently associated with radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis (adjusted OR 5.86; 95% CI 1.20 to 28.5). Conclusions: Further investigations including a MDCT scan should be considered in a child with a chronic wet cough that persists following 4 weeks of oral antibiotics. However, while reducing the likelihood of underlying bronchiectasis, responding well to a single prolonged course of antibiotics does not exclude this diagnosis completely.",Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,0.16943475604057312
27,2019,16235384,"Background: Cough is the most common symptom which presents to doctors. Chronic cough is reported in up to 9% of preschool aged children. American general practice guidelines suggest antimicrobial treatment may be indicated in children with cough lasting &gt; 10 days. Questions concerning the benefits and harm of antibiotic treatment for prolonged cough in children need to be resolved. Objectives: A Cochrane systematic review was undertaken to determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with chronic moist cough (excluding those with bronchiectasis or other underlying respiratory illnesses). Search strategy: The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. The latest searches were performed on 12th April 2004. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic moist cough were considered. Data collection and analysis: Results of searches were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion. Two independent reviewers selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. Authors were contacted for further information. Data were analysed as 'intention to treat'. Main results: Two studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. Neither study was high quality. Both studies failed to include a prospective analysis of cough quality in their inclusion criteria, although indicating &gt;75% of children included had moist cough (Darelid 1993). A total of 140 patients, aged seven years or less, were included in meta-analysis. Treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) in both studies; pooled odds ratio (OR) was 0.13, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.32 (using intention to treat analysis), which translates to number needed to treat (NNT) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). No significant heterogeneity was found (fixed and random-effects model I(2) was 4%). However for this outcome measure, the overall estimate of effect and degree of statistical heterogeneity were sensitive to the model used for meta-analysis. Progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics, was significantly lower in the treatment group (OR 0.10, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.34), NNT was 4 (95% CI 3 to 5). Adverse events were not significantly increased in the treatment group. Authors' conclusions: Antibiotics are likely to be beneficial in the treatment of children with chronic moist cough. This evidence is however limited by study quality, study design and sensitivity analysis data. The use of antibiotics however has to be balanced against their well known adverse events.

Methods: Parents of children with recurrent or chronic wet cough who had attended the outpatient clinic before the age of three years during 2010-2013 at Stavanger University Hospital, Norway, answered a questionnaire regarding clinical symptoms and current medication at a follow-up in 2017-2018. Results: We invited 840 children to participate, and parents consented for 348 (41.4%) of the children. At the first outpatient visit, 171 children (58.8%) had recurrent episodic and 120 (41.2%) had chronic wet cough. At follow-up at a median age of 82 months, 57.0% in both groups were symptom-free, and 9.4% with episodic cough and 13.3% with chronic cough had more than mild symptoms. During the last 12 months prior to the survey, 27.2% with episodic cough and 18.6% with chronic cough had used inhaled corticosteroids.

27,2019,23788413,"Wet cough is a common feature of many disease processes affecting children. Our aim was to examine the relationships between cough nature, lower airway infection (bacterial, viral, and viral-bacterial) and severity of neutrophilic airway inflammation. We hypothesized that viral-bacterial co-infection of the lower airway would be associated with wet cough and heightened neutrophilic airway inflammation. We prospectively recruited 232 children undergoing elective flexible bronchoscopy. Participants were grouped using a cough nature symptom-based approach, into wet, dry or no cough groups. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and clinical data, including presence, nature, and duration of cough and key demographic factors, were collected. Children with wet cough (n = 143) were more likely to have lower airway bacterial infection (OR 2.6, P = 0.001), viral infection (OR 2.04, P = 0.045) and viral-bacterial co-infection (OR 2.65, P = 0.042) compared to those without wet cough. Wet cough was associated with heightened airway neutrophilia (median 19%) as compared to dry or no cough. Viral-bacterial co-infection was associated with the highest median %neutrophils (33.5%) compared to bacteria only, virus/es only and no infection (20%, 18%, and 6%, respectively, P 0.0001). Children with wet cough had higher rates of lower airway infection with bacteria and viruses. Maximal neutrophilic airway inflammation was seen in those with viral-bacterial co-infection.

Selection criteria: All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough were included in the systematic review. Data collection and analysis: At least three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial. Main results: Twelve trials with 1,720 participants met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials investigated treatment regimens and two investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. Results showed that short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three days, clarithromycin for seven days, or erythromycin estolate for seven days) were equally effective with long-term antibiotic treatment (erythromycin estolate or erythromycin for 14 days) in the microbiological eradication of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx. The relative risk (RR) was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05). Side effects were fewer with short-term treatment (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). There were no differences in clinical improvement or microbiological relapse between short and long-term treatment regimens. Contact prophylaxis (of contacts older than six months of age) with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases that developed culture positive B. pertussis.

In Peru, actual public health programs indicate that vaccination against B. pertussis must be mandatory and generalized, besides all detected cases must be reported. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of B. pertussis among children under five years of age with a presumptive diagnosis of whopping cough in Cajamarca, a region located in northern Peru. Materials and methods: The population of this cross-sectional study were children under 5 years old hospitalized as presumptive cases of pertussis during December 2017 to December 2018. The nasopharyngeal samples were analyzed by real-time PCR for the detection of B. pertussis. Results: B. pertussis was identified as PCR + in 42.3% of our sample (33/78). The clinical presentation that was observed most frequently includes paroxysmal coughing (97%), difficulty breathing (69.7%), cyanosis (72.7%) and post-tussive emesis (60.6%). Additionally, pneumonia was the most observed complication (33.3%). Four of the patients with PCR+ for B. pertussis presented only lymphocytosis, five only leukocytosis, two patients with decreased leukocytosis and lymphocytes and only one patient with leukopenia and relative lymphocytosis. There was a percentage of 84.8% of unvaccinated children in the PCR+ group. Finally, the mother was the most frequent symptom carrier (18.2%). Conclusion: In conclusion, in the studied population there is a high rate of PCR+ cases for B. pertussis . Laboratory values may show leukopenia or lymphopenia in patients with pertussis. It is necessary to use appropriate laboratory diagnostic tests in all infants with respiratory symptoms for B. pertussis.

Little is reported about the antibiotic resistance patterns and mechanism of drug resistance of Bordetella parapertussis. The objective of this study has been to investigate antimicrobial resistance, distribution of integrons and presence of gene cassettes to quinolones (qnr) and sulfonamides (sul) among B. parapertussis strains' isolated from Pakistan. Thirty-five (35) samples were collected from various hospitals of Pakistan from children (median age 3 years) with pertussis-like symptoms, all were tested and confirmed to be B. Parapertussis. Resistance profile of Ampicillin, Cephalexin, Sulphamethoxazole, Chloramphenicol, Ofloxacin, Nalidixic acid, Gentamycin and Erythromycin were investigated through all samples. Majority of the isolates were found to be resistant to the afore-mentioned antibiotics except erythromycin. All isolates were resistant to quinolones phenotypically, but qnr genes were detected in only 25.7% (9/35) of isolates. On the other hand, 71.4% (25/35) isolates were resistant to sulfonamides phenotypically. From these 71% strains showing phenotypical resistance, 96% (24/25) were found to possess sul genes. Only two isolates were carrying class 1 integrons, which also harbored sul gene and qnr gene cassettes.

28,2019,21034844,"Pertussis (whooping cough) is one of the commonest vaccine preventable diseases in the UK, despite vaccination coverage being maintained for the last 15 years at over 90% among infants and the addition of a pre-school booster to the UK national immunisation programme in 2001. However, it is known that pertussis vaccine does not confer long-term immunity to clinical infection. Evidence of pertussis infection has been reported in 37% of children presenting in UK primary care and 20% of adolescents and adults presenting in Canadian health centres with persistent cough. In children and adults with persistent cough, paroxysmal coughing is the most sensitive indicator of pertussis, but has poor specificity and limited diagnostic value. Vomiting and whooping, particularly in combination, are stronger predictors of pertussis. Cough duration is longer in children than in adults with pertussis (median cough duration 112 days versus 42 days); individuals may take even longer to recover fully and regain previous levels of exercise tolerance. A diagnosis of pertussis may be confirmed by culture, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or serology. Single estimates of anti-pertussis toxin (PT) antibody titres in blood or oral fluid samples are highly specific. There are currently no proven efficacious treatments for pertussis-induced cough. Treatment with macrolide antibiotics reduces the duration of an individual's infectious period, but does not alter the duration of cough. Further research is needed to re-examine the epidemiology of pertussis in countries with different vaccination schedules, find efficacious treatments and develop methods of measuring cough frequency and severity in patients with pertussis-induced cough.",Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for whooping cough (pertussis)?,antibiotics whooping cough,1.0,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for whooping cough (pertussis)?,0.09517611563205719
28,2019,26837155,"Whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory disease which is caused predominantly by the gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Further Bordetella species such as B. parapertussis and the recently discovered species B. holmesii are also involved in whooping cough-like diseases. Depending on age, vaccination status and distance to pre-infection with B. pertussis, whooping cough shows a wide range of symptoms. The disease occurs at any age, leaving only short time immunity. During the last 15 years, in industrialized countries the number of reported pertussis cases has been increased markedly. The reason for this observation is still unclear Macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin are regarded as antibiotics of first choice. In Germany, combination vaccines containing acellular pertussis vaccines is the most important strategy of prevention.

The antibiotic agar dilution method was used. The minimum concentration of macrolides which inhibited growth of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis was calculated for 50% (MIC50) and 90% (MIC90) of isolates. The susceptibility to macrolides of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis strains isolated in the years 1968 and 1997-99 did not differ significantly. The MIC90 values of erythromycin were the same for B. pertussis (MIC90 = 0.125 mg/l) and B. parapertussis strains (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/l) recovered in 1968 as for those recovered in the years 1997-99. The most active antibiotic against all strains was azithromycin (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/l). The least active antibiotics were oleandomycin (MIC90 = 2-4 mg/l) and spiramycin (MIC90 = 8 mg/l).

The inoculated plates were cultured in an incubator at 35 degrees C for 3 to 7 days. During the period from 1990 to 1993, B. pertussis (43 strains) and B. parapertussis (1 strain) were isolated from 145 whooping cough patients and 34 relatives. B. pertussis were isolated sufficiently in June to December during the year. It was suggested that during this period epidemics of whooping cough occurred. All isolates of B. pertussis had K antigen consisting of 1, 3, and 6. The determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antibiotics to B. pertussis was carried out by the micro dilution technique modified from the standard methods. The Stainer-Scholte broth, supplemented with heptakis (2,6-O-dimethyl) beta-cyclodextrin, was used for dilution of the drug, and also for cultivation of bacteria. For determining susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics, twenty seven isolates of B. pertussis and one of B. parapertussis were precultured on CSM at 35 degrees C for 2 days. The turbidity of broth cultures was adjusted to that of McFarland no. 0.5, and diluted to the concentration of 10(6) CFU/ml. One hundred microliters of these suspensions were added to 25 microliters of each antibiotic solution. After incubation for 3 days at 35 degrees C, the turbidity of the bacteria was read macroscopically for determining the MICs.

29,2019,32179662,"Background and objectives: Antibiotic therapy is often prescribed for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children despite a lack of knowledge of causative pathogen. Our objective in this study was to investigate the association between antibiotic prescription and treatment failure in children with suspected CAP who are discharged from the hospital emergency department (ED). Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of children (ages 3 months-18 years) who were discharged from the ED with suspected CAP. The primary exposure was antibiotic receipt or prescription. The primary outcome was treatment failure (ie, hospitalization after being discharged from the ED, return visit with antibiotic initiation or change, or antibiotic change within 7-15 days from the ED visit). The secondary outcomes included parent-reported quality-of-life measures. Propensity score matching was used to limit potential bias attributable to treatment selection between children who did and did not receive an antibiotic prescription. Results: Of 337 eligible children, 294 were matched on the basis of propensity score. There was no statistical difference in treatment failure between children who received antibiotics and those who did not (odds ratio 1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.45-2.2). There was no difference in the proportion of children with return visits with hospitalization (3.4% with antibiotics versus 3.4% without), initiation and/or change of antibiotics (4.8% vs 6.1%), or parent-reported quality-of-life measures.

We aimed to estimate the proportion of children receiving antibiotics for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that were likely to have a bacterial infection. Furthermore, we described antibiotic use in relation to guidelines. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study from a paediatric department in Norway. During 2017, all admitted children aged 0-17 years receiving antibiotics for CAP were enrolled in the study. We collected relevant data and defined likely CAP as one or more of the following: radiologically confirmed pneumonia, c-reactive protein of at least 100 mg/L, positive bacterial culture from blood or pleura, detection of bacteria from the nasopharynx associated with atypical pneumonia. Results: In total, 70 episodes of suspected CAP were included. Median age was 41.5 months, and 36 (51%) were girls. Of all treatments, 38 (54%) fulfilled our criteria for likely CAP. Median duration of treatment was 10 days. Of empirical treatments, 36 (57%) only involved penicillin. None of the children had neutropenia or complications, and only two needed intensive care.

29,2019,22100740,"Background: Although antibiotics are recommended for the primary care management of community-acquired pneumonia, a recent UK study reported that most children admitted to hospital had not received antibiotics. Objective: To describe primary care antibiotic use for children subsequently hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia. Design/methods: A case series of 280 children 5 years old hospitalised with pneumonia in Auckland, New Zealand. Pneumonia was defined as an acute illness with cough or respiratory distress, the presence of tachypnoea or indrawing and an abnormal chest radiograph. Receipt of antibiotics was determined by parental report and medical record review. Results: Fewer than half (108, 39%) of the children had received an antibiotic before hospital admission. For 60 children (21%) there had been no opportunity to prescribe because the illness evolved rapidly, resulting in early hospital admission. For the remaining 112 children (40%) an opportunity to receive antibiotics was missed. The parent failed to obtain the antibiotic prescribed for 23 children (21% of 112), but in 24 children (21%) pneumonia was diagnosed but no antibiotic prescribed and in a further 28 children (25%) the diagnosis was not made despite parental report of symptoms suggesting pneumonia. Missed opportunities to prescribe were not associated with increased overall severity of symptoms at hospital presentation but were associated with an increased risk of: focal chest radiological abnormalities (rate ratio (RR)=2.14; 95% CI 1.49 to 2.83), peripheral leucocytosis &gt;15×10(9)/l (RR=2.29; 95% CI 1.61 to 2.98) and bacteraemia (RR=6.68, 95% CI 1.08 to 58.44). Conclusions: Young children with community-acquired pneumonia may not receive an antibiotic before hospital admission because the illness evolves rapidly or the prescribed medicine is not given by parents.

29,2019,35094614,"Introduction: Despite availability of several official guidelines, not all the problems related to the most effective and safe use of antibiotics in children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) have been solved. Presently, too many children receive unneeded antibiotics or, when antibiotics are mandatory, the choice of the drug is not appropriate. Areas covered: In this paper, the authors discuss the remaining unsolved problems for rational antibiotic therapy use in pediatric community-acquired pneumonia and provide their expert perspectives. Expert opinion: Further improvement in pediatric CAP management could be derived from physician education on antibiotic use and a larger use, particularly in office practice, of point of care testing or new technologies (i.e. artificial intelligence) to define etiology of a lower respiratory infection. However, recommendations regarding the duration of antibiotic therapy vary largely because of the absence of reliable data on the optimal CAP treatment according to the bacterial etiology of the disease, its severity, and child characteristics. Available evidence seems to confirm that a short course of antibiotics, approximately 5 days, can be effective and lead to results not substantially different from those obtained with prolonged-course antibiotic therapy, at least in patients with mild to moderate disease.",Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,antibiotics children pneumonia,1.0,Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,0.15971624851226807

Study design: We performed a retrospective cohort study from 2010-2016 using the IBM Watson MarketScan Medicaid Database, a claims database of publicly insured patients from 11 states. We included children 1-18 years old with outpatient CAP who filled a prescription for oral antibiotics (n = 121 846 encounters). We used multivariable logistic regression to determine associations between the duration of prescribed antibiotics (5-9 days vs 10-14 days) and subsequent hospitalizations, new antibiotic prescriptions, and acute care visits. Outcomes were measured during the 14 days following the end of the dispensed antibiotic course. Results: The most commonly prescribed duration of antibiotics was 10 days (82.8% of prescriptions), and 10.5% of patients received short-duration therapy. During the follow-up period, 0.2% of patients were hospitalized, 6.2% filled a new antibiotic prescription, and 5.1% had an acute care visit. Compared with the prolonged-duration group, the aORs for hospitalization, new antibiotic prescriptions, and acute care visits in the short-duration group were 1.16 (95% CI 0.80-1.66), 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-1.01), and 1.06 (95% CI 0.98-1.15), respectively. Conclusions: Most children treated for CAP as outpatients are prescribed at least 10 days of antibiotic therapy.

However, there are no validated guidelines for pneumonia management in older children and data to support their development are limited. We sought to understand risk factors for mortality among children aged 5-14 years hospitalised with pneumonia in district-level health facilities in Kenya. Methods: We did a retrospective cohort study using data collected from an established clinical information network of 13 hospitals. We reviewed records for children aged 5-14 years admitted with pneumonia between 1 March 2014 and 28 February 2018. Individual clinical signs were examined for association with inpatient mortality using logistic regression. We used existing WHO criteria (intended for under 5s) to define levels of severity and examined their performance in identifying those at increased risk of death. Results: 1832 children were diagnosed with pneumonia and 145 (7.9%) died. Severe pallor was strongly associated with mortality (adjusted OR (aOR) 8.06, 95% CI 4.72 to 13.75) as were reduced consciousness, mild/moderate pallor, central cyanosis and older age (&gt;9 years) (aOR &gt;2). Comorbidities HIV and severe acute malnutrition were also associated with death (aOR 2.31, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.84 and aOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.21, respectively). The presence of clinical characteristics used by WHO to define severe pneumonia was associated with death in univariate analysis (OR 2.69). However, this combination of clinical characteristics was poor in discriminating those at risk of death (sensitivity: 0.56, specificity: 0.68, and area under the curve: 0.62). Conclusion: Children &gt;5 years have high inpatient pneumonia mortality. These findings also suggest that the WHO criteria for classification of severity for children under 5 years do not appear to be a valid tool for risk assessment in this older age group, indicating the urgent need for evidence-based clinical guidelines for this neglected population.",Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,antibiotics children pneumonia,1.0,Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,0.15702009201049805

One of the known mechanisms in the tinnitus area with unknown reason is oxidative events. Based on the prevalence and economic costs and physical- psychological side effects caused by tinnitus and the importance of finding a suitable solution for its prevention and treatment, the need for further studies becomes more obvious in this context. This review article aimed to review studies on the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba as a medicinal plant on patients with tinnitus. Evidence acquisitions: Google Scholar, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), PubMed, LISTA (EBSCO) and Web of Science have been searched. Results: There are many studies on the therapeutic effect of Ginkgo biloba on patients with tinnitus. Most findings are in contrast with each other so that some of studies reported that Ginkgo biloba is effective in the treatment of tinnitus and other studies referred to it as ineffective herbal medicine. Generally, according to the previous studies and the present study, it can mention that the Ginkgo biloba may somewhat improve tinnitus.

At present no specific therapy for tinnitus is acknowledged to be satisfactory in all patients. There are a number of reports in the literature suggesting that Ginkgo biloba may be effective in the management of tinnitus. However, there also appears to be a strong placebo effect in tinnitus management. Objectives: To assess the effect of Ginkgo biloba in patients who are troubled by tinnitus. Search strategy: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library Issue 4 2003), MEDLINE (1966 - 2003), EMBASE (1974 - 2003), and reference lists of identified publications. Date of the most recent search was December 2003. Selection criteria: Adults (18 years and over) complaining of tinnitus. Adults with a primary complaint of cerebral insufficiency where tinnitus forms part of the syndrome. Data collection and analysis: Both reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. Main results: Twelve trials were identified from the search as being relevant to the review. Ten trials were excluded on methodological grounds. No trials of tinnitus in cerebral insufficiency reached a satisfactory standard for inclusion in the review. There was no evidence that Ginkgo biloba was effective for the primary complaint of tinnitus. The incidence of side effects was small. Reviewers' conclusions: The limited evidence did not demonstrate that Ginkgo biloba was effective for tinnitus which is a primary complaint.

A meta-analysis of randomized placebo controlled double blind trials. Participants included 66 adult patients with tinnitus and six (including our study) randomized placebo controlled double blind trials were meta-analysed. The main outcome measures were the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Glasgow Health Status Inventory (GHSI) and average of hearing threshold at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz. In the meta-analysis the proportion of patients gaining benefit and an overall odds ratio were determined. The results showed the mean difference in change of the THI, GHSI and hearing between Ginkgo biloba (n = 31) and placebo group (n = 29) was 2.51 (CI -10.1, 5.1, P = 0.51), 0.58 (CI-4.8, 3.6, P = 0.38) and 0.68 db (CI -4.13, 2.8, P = 0.69).

32,2019,30339143,"Introduction: Multiple interventions have been postulated for the treatment of tinnitus, but none has been established as clearly effective. Ginkgo biloba has been proposed among the alternatives. Methods: To answer this question we used Epistemonikos, the largest database of systematic reviews in health, which is maintained by screening multiple information sources, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, among others. We extracted data from the systematic reviews, reanalyzed data of primary studies, and generated a summary of findings table using the GRADE approach. Results and conclusions: We identified three systematic reviews including four primary studies, all corresponding to randomized trials. We concluded the use of Ginkgo biloba probably does not decrease the severity of tinnitus.

32,2019,23543524,"Background: This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 2, 2004 and previously updated in 2007 and 2009.Tinnitus can be described as the perception of sound in the absence of external acoustic stimulation. At present no specific therapy for tinnitus is acknowledged to be satisfactory in all patients. There are a number of reports in the literature suggesting that Ginkgo biloba may be effective in the management of tinnitus. However, there also appears to be a strong placebo effect in tinnitus management. Objectives: To assess the effect of Ginkgo biloba in patients who are troubled by tinnitus. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; AMED; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 12 March 2012. Selection criteria: Adults (18 years and over) complaining of tinnitus or adults with a primary complaint of cerebral insufficiency, where tinnitus forms part of the syndrome. Data collection and analysis: Both original authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. For the 2012 update two authors determined trial eligibility, extracted data, analysed data and updated the contents of the review. Main results: Four trials with a total of 1543 participants were included in the review; we assessed all the included studies as having a low risk of bias. Three trials (1143 participants) included patients with a primary complaint of tinnitus and one (400 participants) included patients with mild to moderate dementia, some of whom had tinnitus.There was no evidence that Gingko biloba was effective in patients with a primary complaint of tinnitus. In the study of patients with dementia, mean baseline levels of tinnitus were low (1.7 to 2.5 on a 10-point subjective symptom rating scale). A small but statistically significant reduction of 1.5 and 0.7 points was seen in patients taking Gingko biloba with vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease respectively. The practical clinical significance of this is unclear. The incidence of side effects was low. Authors' conclusions: The limited evidence does not demonstrate that Ginkgo biloba is effective for tinnitus when this is the primary complaint.",Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,ginkgo biloba tinnitus,0.0,Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,0.37645336985588074
32,2019,21857784,"Tinnitus is a symptom frequently encountered by ear, nose, and throat practitioners. A causal treatment is rarely possible, and drug and nondrug treatment options are limited. One of the frequently prescribed treatments is Ginkgo biloba extract. Therefore, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of Ginkgo biloba extract preparations were searched for and reviewed systematically. There is evidence of efficacy for the standardized extract, EGb 761(®) (Dr Willmar Schwabe GmbH &amp; Co KG Pharmaceuticals, Karlsruhe, Germany), in the treatment of tinnitus from three trials in patients in whom tinnitus was the primary complaint. Supportive evidence comes from a further five trials in patients with age-associated cognitive impairment or dementia in whom tinnitus was present as a concomitant symptom. As yet, the efficacy of other ginkgo preparations has not been proven, which does not necessarily indicate ineffectiveness, but may be due to flawed clinical trials. In conclusion, EGb 761(®), a standardized Ginkgo biloba extract, is an evidence-based treatment option in tinnitus.",Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,ginkgo biloba tinnitus,0.0,Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,0.9577143788337708
32,2019,21765586,"Subjective tinnitus, the phantom ringing or buzzing sensation that occurs in the absence of sound, affects 12-14% of adults; in some cases the tinnitus is so severe or disabling that patients seek medical treatment. However, although the economic and emotional impact of tinnitus is large, there are currently no FDA-approved drugs to treat this condition. Clinical trials are now underway to evaluate the efficacy of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and dopamine D(2) antagonists, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists and zinc dietary supplements. Previous off-label clinical studies, while not definitive, suggest that patients with severe depression may experience improvement in their tinnitus after treatment with antidepressants such as nortriptyline or sertraline. A small subpopulation of patients with what has been described as ""typewriter tinnitus"" have been shown to gain significant relief from the anticonvulsant carbamazepine. Preliminary studies with misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue, and sulpiride, a dopamine D(2) antagonist, have shown promise. Animal behavioral studies suggest that GABA transaminase inhibitors and potassium channel modulators can suppress tinnitus. Additionally, improvements in tinnitus have also been noted in patients taking melatonin for significant sleep disturbances. Like other complex neurological disorders, one drug is unlikely to resolve tinnitus in all patients; therapies targeting specific subgroups are likely to yield the greatest success.",Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,ginkgo biloba tinnitus,0.0,Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,0.9561501145362854
32,2019,11154618,"Objective: To determine whether Ginkgo biloba is effective in treating tinnitus. Design: Double blind, placebo controlled trial using postal questionnaires. Participants: 1121 healthy people aged between 18 and 70 years with tinnitus that was comparatively stable; 978 participants were matched (489 pairs). Intervention: 12 weeks' treatment with either 50 mg Ginkgo biloba extract LI 1370 three times daily or placebo. Main outcome measures: Participants' assessment of tinnitus before, during, and after treatment. Questionnaires included items assessing perception of how loud and how troublesome tinnitus was. Changes in loudness were rated on a six point scale. Changes in how troublesome were rated on a five point scale. Results: There were no significant differences in primary or secondary outcome measures between the groups. 34 of 360 participants receiving active treatment reported that their tinnitus was less troublesome after 12 weeks of treatment compared with 35 of 360 participants who took placebo. Conclusions: 50 mg Ginkgo biloba extract LI 1370 given 3 times daily for 12 weeks is no more effective than placebo in treating tinnitus.",Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,ginkgo biloba tinnitus,0.0,Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,0.3734329640865326
33,2019,10796583,"Background: Hypnotherapy is widely promoted as a method for aiding smoking cessation. It is proposed to act on underlying impulses to weaken the desire to smoke or strengthen the will to stop. Objectives: The objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register. Selection criteria: We considered randomised trials of hypnotherapy which reported smoking cessation rates at least six months after the beginning of treatment. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers extracted data on the type of subjects, the type and duration of the hypnotherapy, the nature of the control group,the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. Subjects lost to follow-up were counted as smokers. Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model. Main results: Nine studies compared hypnotherapy with 14 different control interventions. There was significant heterogeneity between the results of the individual studies, with conflicting results for the effectiveness of hypnotherapy compared to no treatment or to advice. We therefore did not attempt to calculate pooled odds ratios for the overall effect of hypnotherapy. There was no evidence of an effect of hypnotherapy compared to rapid smoking or psychological treatment.

This study examines the impact of a smoke-free policy and the effectiveness of an accompanying hypnotherapy smoking cessation program. Participants in the 90-minute smoking cessation seminar were surveyed 12 months after the program was implemented (n = 2642; response rate = 76%). Seventy-one percent of the smokers participated in the hypnotherapy program. Fifteen percent of survey respondents quit and remained continuously abstinent. A survey to assess attitudes toward the policy was conducted 1 year after policy implementation (n = 1256; response rate = 64%).

Neither immediate quitting nor continued abstinence correlated with hypnotizability.

33,2019,24559809,"Background: The efficacy of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is well documented. However, due to relapse rates and side effects, hypnotherapy is gaining attention as an alternative treatment option. The aim of this one-center randomized study was to compare the efficacy of hypnotherapy alone, as well as hypnotherapy with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), to conventional NRT in patients hospitalized with a cardiac or pulmonary illness. Methods: We evaluated self-reported and biochemically verified 7-day prevalence smoking abstinence rates at 12 and 26 weeks post-hospitalization. Patients (n=164) were randomized into one of three counseling-based treatment groups: NRT for 30 days (NRT; n=41), a 90-min hypnotherapy session (H; n=39), and NRT with hypnotherapy (HNRT; n=37). Treatment groups were compared to a ""self-quit"" group of 35 patients who refused intervention. Results: Hypnotherapy patients were more likely than NRT patients to be nonsmokers at 12 weeks (43.9% vs. 28.2%; p=0.14) and 26 weeks after hospitalization (36.6% vs. 18.0%; p=0.06). Smoking abstinence rates in the HNRT group were similar to the H group. There was no difference in smoking abstinence rates at 26 weeks between ""self quit"" and participants in any of the treatment groups. In multivariable regression analysis adjusting for diagnosis and demographic characteristics, H and HNRT were over three times more likely than NRT participants to abstain at 26-weeks post-discharge (RR=3.6; p=0.03 and RR=3.2; p=0.04, respectively).

The most recent search was performed on 18 July 2018. Selection criteria: We considered randomized controlled trials that recruited people who smoked and implemented a hypnotherapy intervention for smoking cessation compared with no treatment, or with any other therapeutic interventions. Trials were required to report smoking cessation rates at least six months after the beginning of treatment. Study eligibility was determined by at least two review authors, independently. Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors independently extracted data on participant characteristics, the type and duration of hypnotherapy, the nature of the control group, smoking status, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. These authors also independently assessed the quality of the included studies. In undertaking this work, we used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months' follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated abstinence rates where available. Those lost to follow-up were considered to still be smoking. We summarized effects as risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. We also noted any adverse events reported. Main results: We included three new trials in this update, which brings the total to 14 included studies that compared hypnotherapy with 22 different control interventions. The studies included a total of 1926 participants. Studies were diverse and a single meta-analysis was not possible. We judged only one study to be at low risk of bias overall; we judged 10 studies to be at high risk of bias and three at unclear risk. Studies did not provide reliable evidence of a greater benefit from hypnotherapy compared with other interventions or no treatment for smoking cessation. Most individual studies did not find statistically significant differences in quit rates after six months or longer, and studies that did detect differences typically had methodological limitations.Pooling small groups of relatively comparable studies did not provide reliable evidence for a specific effect of hypnotherapy relative to controls. There was low certainty evidence, limited by imprecision and risk of bias, that showed no statistically significant difference between hypnotherapy and attention-matched behavioural treatments (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.61; I<sup>2</sup> = 36%; 6 studies, 957 participants). Results were similarly imprecise, and also limited by risk of bias, when comparing hypnotherapy to intensive behavioural interventions (not matched for contact time) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.82; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 211 participants; very low certainty evidence). Results from one small study (40 participants) detected a statistically significant benefit of hypnotherapy compared to no intervention (RR 19.00, 95% CI 1.18 to 305.88), but this evidence was judged to be of very low certainty due to high risk of bias and imprecision. No significant differences were detected in comparisons of hypnotherapy with brief behavioural interventions (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.69; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 269 participants), rapid/focused smoking (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.33; I<sup>2</sup> = 65%; 2 studies, 54 participants), and pharmacotherapies (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.20; I<sup>2</sup> = 5%; 2 studies, 197 participants). When hypnotherapy was evaluated as an adjunct to other treatments, the pooled result from five studies showed a statistically significant benefit in favour of hypnotherapy (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.35; I² = 62%; 224 participants); however, this result should be interpreted with caution due to the high risk of bias across studies (four had a high risk or bias, one had an unclear risk), and substantial statistical heterogeneity.Most studies did not provide information on whether data specifically relating to adverse events were collected, and whether or not any adverse events occurred. One study that did collect such data did not find a statistically significant difference in the adverse event 'index' between hypnotherapy and relaxation. Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to determine whether hypnotherapy is more effective for smoking cessation than other forms of behavioural support or unassisted quitting. If a benefit is present, current evidence suggests the benefit is small at most. There is very little evidence on whether hypnotherapy causes adverse effects, but the existing data show no evidence that it does.

33,2019,24365274,"Background: Despite the popularity of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation, the efficacy of this method is unclear. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of a single-session of group hypnotherapy for smoking cessation compared to relaxation in Swiss adult smokers. Methods: This was a cluster-randomised, parallel-group, controlled trial. A single session of hypnosis or relaxation for smoking cessation was delivered to groups of smokers (median size = 11). Participants were 223 smokers consuming ≥ 5 cigarettes per day, willing to quit and not using cessation aids (47.1% females, M = 37.5 years [SD = 11.8], 86.1% Swiss). Nicotine withdrawal, smoking abstinence self-efficacy, and adverse reactions were assessed at a 2-week follow-up. The main outcome, self-reported 30-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence, was assessed at a 6-month follow up. Abstinence was validated through salivary analysis. Secondary outcomes included number of cigarettes smoked per day, smoking abstinence self-efficacy, and nicotine withdrawal. Results: At the 6-month follow up, 14.7% in the hypnosis group and 17.8% in the relaxation group were abstinent. The intervention had no effect on smoking status (p = .73) or on the number of cigarettes smoked per day (p = .56). Smoking abstinence self-efficacy did not differ between the interventions (p = .14) at the 2-week follow-up, but non-smokers in the hypnosis group experienced reduced withdrawal (p = .02). Both interventions produced few adverse reactions (p = .81).

Aim: To evaluate the long-term effect of treatment of female incontinence by the general practitioner (pelvic floor exercises, and bladder training) in female urinary incontinence. Method: A total of 88 women, aged between 20 and 65, who had participated in a controlled trial between 1987 and 1990, were contacted to participate in a five-year follow-up study. Stress incontinence and urge incontinence were treated by means of pelvic floor exercises and bladder training respectively, while a mixed incontinence was treated by bladder training followed by pelvic floor exercises. The outcome measures were a constructed scale for the severity of the incontinence, a seven-day bladder chart, and a questionnaire concerning patients' opinions. All patients were evaluated by an independent researcher. Results: Compared with the one-year follow-up, the number of continent women remained the same, but a significantly greater number of patients worsened. Forty per cent of the women stayed in the same category of severity, while 45% moved into the contiguous categories. The weekly frequency of wet episodes increased significantly, with a mean increase of 2.65 episodes. Women with mixed incontinence were especially prone to relapse in the long-term. Compliance with the exercises had a positive influence on the outcomes, with 67% of the women expressing satisfaction with the results.

34,2019,19170835,"Introduction: Coital urinary incontinence is a frequently underreported symptom, with a relevant impact on women's sexuality and quality of life. Aim: This article will review the available evidence on incidence, pathophysiology, and treatment of coital urinary incontinence with the attempt to present the current state of the art. Methods: PubMed was searched for reports about coital urinary incontinence that were published from 1970 to 2008, and the most relevant articles were reviewed. Main outcome measures: Review on epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of coital incontinence. Results: The incidence of coital incontinence in incontinent women has been reported to range between 10% and 27%. At present, some evidence suggests an association between urinary leakage at penetration and urodynamic stress (USI) incontinence as well as urinary leakage during orgasm and detrusor overactivity (DO). When treatment for these conditions are based upon urodynamic findings, pelvic floor muscle training, surgery, and pharmacotherapy show satisfactory cure rates. Conclusions: Coital urinary incontinence deserves much more attention in clinical practice: women should be specifically interviewed for this disturbance because it has a very negative impact on their sexuality. If a reliable urodynamic diagnosis is made, coital urinary incontinence at penetration can be cured in more than 80% of cases by surgery in the presence of USI. The form of coital incontinence during orgasm is curable by antimuscarinic treatment in about 60% of cases when associated with DO.",How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,exercises for female incontinence,1.0,How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,0.9381269216537476
34,2019,12707876,"Aim: Although research has demonstrated the efficacy of pelvic floor exercises (PFXs) for the prevention and treatment of female urinary incontinence (FUI), adherence to PFX regimens is commonly poor. There is some evidence that this finding is in part due to a lack of knowledge about how to perform PFXs correctly and misconceptions about the required frequency and duration of PFX regimens. Methods: By using a sample of 720 postpartum women, this study investigates women's PFX regimens both before and during pregnancy and postpartum. Results: Findings demonstrated that most women were aware of the required frequency for PFXs (at least every second day): just over half had done them this often during pregnancy and 91% intended to do so postpartum. However, few had done them at this level before pregnancy and less than half knew that PFXs should be carried out indefinitely throughout the lifetime. Moreover, only two thirds were confident that they were doing PFXs correctly. Conclusion: The findings suggest that, despite good knowledge of the required frequency of PFXs, few women practise them regularly over their lifetime, many apparently perceiving PFXs as relevant only to the childbirth years. Implications for health professionals in addressing these gaps in women's knowledge and practises are discussed.",How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,exercises for female incontinence,1.0,How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,0.28044670820236206

Our aim was to assess the utilisation and effectiveness of our supervised pelvic floor muscle training service and assess the impact of incontinence scores before physiotherapy on the subsequent results of physiotherapy. Methods: All 271 patients referred to physiotherapy for symptoms of incontinence filled out the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire-Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms before starting treatment. Depending on pelvic floor muscle assessment, plans for exercises and follow up were made. If the strength of pelvic floor muscles was poor, electrical stimulation was offered. If awareness of the pelvic floor muscle contraction was poor, bio feedback was offered. Group sessions and vaginal cones were also used. Depending on the response to the treatment; patients were either discharged, referred to Urogynaecology clinic or continued physiotherapy. All patients who were discharged or referred for surgery were given a post treatment questionnaire to fill out. Results: 79 (56 %) of 132 women with stress, 49 (51 %) of 98 with mixed and 27 (66 %) of 41 with urge incontinence reported successful control of symptoms (overall success 54 %). However, 65 % of women with incontinence scores of 0-5 before physiotherapy, 64 % with 6-10, 42 % with 11-15 and mere 28 % with 16-20 achieved success with physiotherapy. 27 (10 %) were lost to follow up. Conclusion: 1 in 2 women referred to physiotherapy for incontinence, achieved successful control of symptoms without the need for invasive investigations or surgery. However, poor incontinence scores before the start of physiotherapy is a poor prognostic indicator for success. 90 % women utilised the service.",How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,exercises for female incontinence,1.0,How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,0.28349536657333374
36,2019,11787581,"Despite the availability of highly effective measures for primary prevention, dental caries (tooth decay) remains one of the most common childhood chronic diseases. When properly placed, dental sealants are almost 100% effective in preventing caries on the chewing surfaces of first and second permanent molarteeth. However, sealants remain underused, particularly among children from low-income families and from racial/ethnic minority groups. Schools traditionally have been a setting for both dental disease prevention programs and for oral health status assessment. To determine the prevalence of dental sealant use among third grade students from schools with and without sealant programs, during the 1998-99 school year, the Ohio Department of Health conducted an oral health survey among schoolchildren. This report summarizes the results of this survey, which indicate that targeted, school-based dental sealant programs can substantially increase prevalence of dental sealants. Providing sealant programs in all eligible, high-risk schools could reduce or eliminate racial and economic disparities in the prevalence of dental sealants.",Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,0.9471712708473206

A small proportion of Florida's low-income children receive any preventive dental services, including sealants. The authors conducted a cross-sectional study to assess whether Florida's dentists provide sealants as a preventive measure in their practices, their attitudes and their levels of evidence-based clinical knowledge about appropriate sealant use according to the American Dental Association (ADA) recommendations. The authors also assessed whether the number of years since graduation and reliance on peers or colleagues for regular clinical information were associated with dentists' knowledge. Methods: The authors administered a 25-item pretested questionnaire to a convenience sample of general and pediatric dentists (n = 163) at the 2013 Florida National Dental Convention in Kissimmee, Fla. The authors conducted multivariate linear regression modeling to predict dentists' levels of evidence-based clinical knowledge. Results: Years since graduation (P = .2) and reliance on peers or colleagues for regular clinical information (P = .6) did not predict higher knowledge. Male dentists (P = .003) and those who accepted children enrolled in Medicaid as new patients (P = .01) had significantly more knowledge compared with their counterparts. Conclusions: Most participating dentists used sealants in their practices and had high levels of positive attitudes about using sealants. Overall knowledge regarding the appropriate use of sealants, however, was low. Practical implications: For practicing dental professionals, the authors recommend disseminating evidence-based recommendations for the use of dental sealants via continuing education courses and other possible modalities.

Materials and methods: A self-administrated questionnaire were distributed to 192 private dental practitioners in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India by using simple random sampling. A convenience sampling technique was employed. The questionnaire consisted of 28 items, which included information about knowledge, value, opinion, and practice regarding dental sealants. The questionnaire was obtained from the study by San Martin et al. 2013 and Kailash Asawa et al. 2014. Frequency distribution was tabulated. For frequency distribution strongly, strongly agree, and agree were combined as ""agree"" and strongly disagree and disagree were combined as ""disagree."" There were no changes in ""neutral.""

Data were collected on 2,711 Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy recruits at one recruit in-processing center per service. Women and minorities were oversampled. Both bivariate and logistic regression analysis were done on the need for at least one dental sealant and the prevalence of at least one dental sealant in recruits. Weighted data (101,072) were used for the bivariate analyses; unweighted data were used in the regressions. Results show that 8.7% of recruits need dental sealants and that 14.8% have dental sealants.

36,2019,21888778,"Purpose: The lack of access to preventive dental services, such as dental sealants, can be a major barrier to optimal dental health. School-based dental sealant programs can serve as programs to improve access to preventive dental services. Methods: This school-based dental sealant program managed by a Boston dental school with collaborating partners in the metro west area of Massachusetts provides free dental sealants to second grade children. The number of second grade children having dental sealants was tracked for 6 school years and compared with the Healthy People 2010 objective of 50% of all children aged 8 years to have at least 1 dental sealant. Results: From school years 2003 to 2004 through 2008 to 2009, 1,609 dental screenings were provided for second grade children. Of those, 1,189 received dental sealants. To determine whether or not the Healthy People 2010 objective was met, the number of children who received dental sealants from the school-based program was added to the number of children who already had their permanent first molars sealed by their own dentist at the time of the dental screening, plus children with sealants per parent report. In total, the aggregate second grade enrollment having sealants during the designated school years was 54%. Conclusion: The specific Healthy People 2010 objective was achieved over the designated time period.

Methods: Of 21 full-text articles examined, a total of 13 were included in this study. These studies are grouped by the type of intervention as follows: (i) sealants compared with no sealants; (ii) sealants compared with other forms of caries prevention; (iii) resin-based sealants compared with glass-ionomer sealants; (iv) different sealing strategies in primary teeth; (v) different sealing strategies in permanent teeth; and (vi) sealants based on school- or clinic-based setting of delivery. All currency is reported in constant 2010 US$. Results: Cost-effectiveness analyses differed due to varying study designs, assumptions, sealant delivery settings, outcomes, caries risk assessment and study durations. Findings varied on the cost-effectiveness of sealants compared with other caries-preventive strategies. Under the assumption of equal caries risk, always sealing primary molars appeared to be the most effective strategy, whereas risk-based sealing was the optimal strategy with differing caries risk. Studies that assessed sealing strategies in permanent teeth reported that risk-based sealing was more cost-effective than not sealing, but they differed on the cost-effectiveness of risk-based seal compared with non-risk-based seal. Sealants delivered in school settings had mixed results on costs but were as equally effective as sealants delivered in private practices. Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness of sealants is dependent on the conditions of delivery. The list of cost-effectiveness ratios for each intervention can support policy makers to estimate expected returns on their investments in dental sealants.",Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,0.9176812767982483
37,2019,16235372,"Background: Symptomatic hemorrhoids are a common medical condition, which increase in prevalence in women during pregnancy and postpartum. Although the evidence appears to be inconclusive, narrative reviews and clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of laxatives (and fiber) for the treatment of hemorrhoids and relief of symptoms. This is due to their safety and low cost. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of laxatives on a wide range of symptoms in people with symptomatic hemorrhoids. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1980 to 2005), CINAHL (1982 to 2005), BIOSIS, and AMED (Allied and Alternative Medicine Database), for eligible trials (including conference proceedings). We sought missing and additional information from authors, industry, and experts in the field. Selection criteria: We selected all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials that compared any type of laxative to placebo or no therapy in any patient population. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion and retrieved all potentially relevant studies. Data were extracted from studies that met our selection criteria on study population, intervention used, pre-specified outcomes, and methodology. We extracted methodological information for the assessment of internal validity: existence and method of generation of the randomization schedule, and method of allocation concealment; blinding of caregivers and outcomes assessors; numbers of and reasons for participants lost to follow up; and use of validated outcome measures. Main results: Seven randomised trials enrolling a total of 378 participants to fiber or a non-fiber control were identified. Meta-analyses using random-effects models showed that laxatives in the form of fiber had a beneficial effect in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids. The risk of not improving hemorrhoids and having persisting symptoms decreased by 53% in the fiber group (risk reduction (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.68). These results are compatible with large treatment effects regarding prolapse, pain, itching, although the pooled analyses showed a tendency toward no-effect for these parametres. The effect on bleeding showed a significant difference in favour of the fiber (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89). Studies including data on multiple follow ups (usually after six weeks and three months) showed consistent results over time. However, we have to stress two possible limitations of this review: the risk of publication bias, and only moderate study quality.

After one week, crossover treatment was administered according to the same methodology. Other treatments and foods potentially related with anorectal symptoms were discontinued during the study periods. Results: Patients assigned low scores to their hemorrhoidal symptoms before the study and the scores remained unchanged during the 48 hours after both placebo and chili pepper treatment, the latter showing no statistically significant effects.

37,2019,7973276,"Main symptoms associated with hemorrhoids are anal bleeding, pruritus as well as weeping and superficial wounds of the rima ani and, finally, hemorrhoidal prolapse. The reason for the symptoms described is a relative anal incontinence due to hemorrhoidal knots prolapsing into the anal channel. There is evidence of an increased sphincteric pressure following increase of intraluminal pressure in colon and rectum in patients whose volumes of stool are too little because of small amounts of dietary fiber or regular use of laxatives. The stop of venous blood flow leads to a constant swelling of the vascular bed in the anal channel, which herniates during defection with variable intensity. Almost half of the patients suffering from hemorrhoids of grade 1 or grade 2 are treated successfully and conservatively (regulation of bowel habits by intake of large quantities of dietary fiber, change of life style and training of sphincter ani). Although injection therapy is used mostly, ligation of the prolapsing knots is the most physiological form of treatment: in retaining the vascular bed, the patient is able to keep complete continence.

38,2019,30237870,"Background: Previous systematic reviews have concluded that lumbar traction is not effective for patients with low back pain (LBP), yet many clinicians continue to assert its clinical effectiveness. Objective: To systematically identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of traction and explore the variability of traction interventions used in each RCT. Method: A literature search started in September 2016 to retrieve systematic reviews and individual RCTs of lumbar traction. The term ""lumbar traction"" and other key words were used in the following databases: Cochrane Registry, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. The retrieved systematic reviews were used to extract individual RCTs. The most current systematic review included RCTs from inception until August 2012. We performed an additional literature search to update this systematic review with newer RCTs published between September 2012 and December 2016. All of the identified RCTs were combined and summarized into a single evidence table. Results: We identified a total of 37 traction RCTs that varied greatly in their method of traction intervention. The RCTs included several types of traction: mechanical (57%), auto-traction (16%), manual (10.8%), gravitational (8.1%) and aquatic (5.4%). There was also great variability in the types of traction force, rhythm, session duration and treatment frequency used in the RCTs. Patient characteristics were a mixture of acute, subacute and chronic LBP; with or without sciatica. Conclusion: There is wide variability in the type of traction, traction parameters and patient characteristics found among the RCTs of lumbar traction. The variability may call into question the conclusion that lumbar traction has little no or value on clinical outcomes. Also, this variability emphasizes the need for targeted delivery methods of traction that match appropriate dosages with specific subgroups of patients with LBP.",Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,0.8194696307182312

Subjects: For this purpose, randomized clinical trials comparing traction with other treatments were selected. Methods: A computer-aided search of the literature was conducted for relevant articles, followed by blinded assessment of the methods of the studies. The main outcome measures were (1) scoring for quality of the designated conduct of studies (based on a methodological checklist with four main categories: study population, interventions, measurement of effect, and data presentation) and the main conclusions of author(s) with regard to traction and (2) calculation of confidence intervals and power of the studies. Results: Only three studies scored more than 50 points (maximum score = 100 points), suggesting that most of the selected studies were of poor quality. None of these three studies showed favorable results for traction. Only four studies, of which one scored more than 50 points, had an acceptable power (1- beta &gt; 80%). Conclusion and discussion: The available reports of studies on the efficacy of traction for back and neck pain do not allow clear conclusions due to the methodological flaws in their design and conduct. Most studies lacked power (1-beta) due to small sample sizes. To date, no conclusions can be drawn about whether a specific traction modality for back or neck pain is effective, or more efficacious than other treatments.

38,2019,18164471,"The management of chronic low back pain (CLBP) has proven to be very challenging in North America, as evidenced by its mounting socioeconomic burden. Choosing among available nonsurgical therapies can be overwhelming for many stakeholders, including patients, health providers, policy makers, and third-party payers. Although all parties share a common goal and wish to use limited health-care resources to support interventions most likely to result in clinically meaningful improvements, there is often uncertainty about the most appropriate intervention for a particular patient. To help understand and evaluate the various commonly used nonsurgical approaches to CLBP, the North American Spine Society has sponsored this special focus issue of The Spine Journal, titled Evidence-Informed Management of Chronic Low Back Pain Without Surgery. Articles in this special focus issue were contributed by leading spine practitioners and researchers, who were invited to summarize the best available evidence for a particular intervention and encouraged to make this information accessible to nonexperts. Each of the articles contains five sections (description, theory, evidence of efficacy, harms, and summary) with common subheadings to facilitate comparison across the 24 different interventions profiled in this special focus issue, blending narrative and systematic review methodology as deemed appropriate by the authors. It is hoped that articles in this special focus issue will be informative and aid in decision making for the many stakeholders evaluating nonsurgical interventions for CLBP.",Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,0.9975201487541199

Summary of background data: The available studies on the efficacy of lumbar traction do not allow clear conclusions because of severe methodologic flaws. The current trial aimed to overcome these shortcomings. Methods: Patients with at least 6 weeks of nonspecific low back pain were selected. High-dose traction was compared with sham (or low-dose) traction. Sham traction was given with a specially developed brace that becomes tighter in the back during traction. This was experienced as if real traction were exerted. The patients and the outcome assessor were unaware of treatment allocation. Outcome measures were: patient's global perceived effect, severity of main complaints, functional status, pain, range of motion, work absence, and medical treatment. Results for the outcome measures at 12 weeks and 6 months after randomization are presented. Results: One hundred and fifty-one patients were randomly allocated to one of the two treatment methods. Intention-to-treat analysis of the 12-week and 6-month results showed no statistically significant differences between the groups on all outcome measures: all 95% confidence intervals included the value zero.

38,2019,24913413,"Traction therapy is one of the most common conservative treatments for low back pain. However, the effects of traction therapy on lumbar spine biomechanics are not well known. We investigated biomechanical effects of two-step traction therapy, which consists of global axial traction and local decompression, on the lumbar spine using a validated three-dimensional finite element model of the lumbar spine. One-third of body weight was applied on the center of the L1 vertebra toward the superior direction for the first axial traction. Anterior translation of the L4 vertebra was considered as the second local decompression. The lordosis angle between the superior planes of the L1 vertebra and sacrum was 44.6° at baseline, 35.2° with global axial traction, and 46.4° with local decompression. The fibers of annulus fibrosus in the posterior region, and intertransverse and posterior longitudinal ligaments experienced stress primarily during global axial traction, these stresses decreased during local decompression. A combination of global axial traction and local decompression would be helpful for reducing tensile stress on the fibers of the annulus fibrosus and ligaments, and intradiscal pressure in traction therapy.

38,2019,23959683,"Background: Traction has been used to treat low-back pain (LBP), often in combination with other treatments. We included both manual and machine-delivered traction in this review. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1995, and previously updated in 2006. Objectives: To assess the effects of traction compared to placebo, sham traction, reference treatments and no treatment in people with LBP. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Back Review Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (January 2006 to August 2012), EMBASE (January 2006 to August 2012), CINAHL (January 2006 to August 2012), and reference lists of articles and personal files. The review authors are not aware of any important new randomized controlled trial (RCTs) on this topic since the date of the last search. Selection criteria: RCTs involving traction to treat acute (less than four weeks' duration), subacute (four to 12 weeks' duration) or chronic (more than 12 weeks' duration) non-specific LBP with or without sciatica. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. As there were insufficient data for statistical pooling, we performed a descriptive analysis. We did not find any case series that identified adverse effects, therefore we evaluated adverse effects that were reported in the included studies. Main results: We included 32 RCTs involving 2762 participants in this review. We considered 16 trials, representing 57% of all participants, to have a low risk of bias based on the Cochrane Back Review Group's 'Risk of bias' tool.For people with mixed symptom patterns (acute, subacute and chronic LBP with and without sciatica), there was low- to moderate-quality evidence that traction may make little or no difference in pain intensity, functional status, global improvement or return to work when compared to placebo, sham traction or no treatment. Similarly, when comparing the combination of physiotherapy plus traction with physiotherapy alone or when comparing traction with other treatments, there was very-low- to moderate-quality evidence that traction may make little or no difference in pain intensity, functional status or global improvement.For people with LBP with sciatica and acute, subacute or chronic pain, there was low- to moderate-quality evidence that traction probably has no impact on pain intensity, functional status or global improvement. This was true when traction was compared with controls and other treatments, as well as when the combination of traction plus physiotherapy was compared with physiotherapy alone. No studies reported the effect of traction on return to work.For chronic LBP without sciatica, there was moderate-quality evidence that traction probably makes little or no difference in pain intensity when compared with sham treatment. No studies reported on the effect of traction on functional status, global improvement or return to work.Adverse effects were reported in seven of the 32 studies. These included increased pain, aggravation of neurological signs and subsequent surgery. Four studies reported that there were no adverse effects. The remaining studies did not mention adverse effects. Authors' conclusions: These findings indicate that traction, either alone or in combination with other treatments, has little or no impact on pain intensity, functional status, global improvement and return to work among people with LBP. There is only limited-quality evidence from studies with small sample sizes and moderate to high risk of bias. The effects shown by these studies are small and are not clinically relevant. Implications for practice To date, the use of traction as treatment for non-specific LBP cannot be motivated by the best available evidence. These conclusions are applicable to both manual and mechanical traction. Implications for research Only new, large, high-quality studies may change the point estimate and its accuracy, but it should be noted that such change may not necessarily favour traction. Therefore, little priority should be given to new studies on the effect of traction treatment alone or as part of a package.",Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,0.3793443441390991
38,2019,18091473,"Study design: Randomized Clinical Trial. Objective: To identify a subgroup of patients with low back pain who are likely to respond favorably to an intervention including mechanical traction. Summary of background data: Previous research has failed to find evidence supporting traction for patients with low back pain. Previous studies have used heterogeneous samples, although clinical experts tend to recommend traction for a more limited subgroup of patients with low back pain. Methods: Sixty-four subjects (mean age 41.1 year, 56.3% female) with low back and leg pain and signs of nerve root compression were randomized to receive a 6-week extension-oriented intervention with or without mechanical traction during the first 2 weeks. Between-group comparisons were conducted for changes in pain, disability, and fear-avoidance beliefs. Baseline variables were explored for potential as subgrouping criteria defining a subgroup of subjects likely to benefit from traction. Results: The group receiving traction showed greater improvements in disability (adjusted mean difference in Oswestry change 7.2 points) and fear-avoidance beliefs (adjusted mean difference in FABQPA change 2.6 points) after 2 weeks. There were no between-group differences after 6 weeks. Two baseline variables were associated with greater improvements with traction treatment; peripheralization with extension movements and a crossed straight leg raise. Conclusion: A subgroup of patients likely to benefit from mechanical traction may exist. The results of this study suggest this subgroup is characterized by the presence of leg symptoms, signs of nerve root compression, and either peripheralization with extension movements or a crossed straight leg raise.

39,2019,34233900,"Objective: To investigate the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for low back pain. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Data sources: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, clinicialtrialsregister.eu, and WHO ICTRP from inception to 23 February 2021. Eligibility criteria for study selection: Randomised controlled trials of muscle relaxants compared with placebo, usual care, waiting list, or no treatment in adults (≥18 years) reporting non-specific low back pain. Data extraction and synthesis: Two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and certainty of the evidence using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations, respectively. Random effects meta-analytical models through restricted maximum likelihood estimation were used to estimate pooled effects and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Outcomes included pain intensity (measured on a 0-100 point scale), disability (0-100 point scale), acceptability (discontinuation of the drug for any reason during treatment), and safety (adverse events, serious adverse events, and number of participants who withdrew from the trial because of an adverse event). Results: 49 trials were included in the review, of which 31, sampling 6505 participants, were quantitatively analysed. For acute low back pain, very low certainty evidence showed that at two weeks or less non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics were associated with a reduction in pain intensity compared with control (mean difference -7.7, 95% confidence interval-12.1 to-3.3) but not a reduction in disability (-3.3, -7.3 to 0.7). Low and very low certainty evidence showed that non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics might increase the risk of an adverse event (relative risk 1.6, 1.2 to 2.0) and might have little to no effect on acceptability (0.8, 0.6 to 1.1) compared with control for acute low back pain, respectively. The number of trials investigating other muscle relaxants and different durations of low back pain were small and the certainty of evidence was reduced because most trials were at high risk of bias. Conclusions: Considerable uncertainty exists about the clinical efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants. Very low and low certainty evidence shows that non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics might provide small but not clinically important reductions in pain intensity at or before two weeks and might increase the risk of an adverse event in acute low back pain, respectively. Large, high quality, placebo controlled trials are urgently needed to resolve uncertainty.

Objectives: To determine the characteristics of patients who take muscle relaxants for back pain after seeking care and to determine the relationship of muscle relaxant use with recovery from the episode of low back pain. Summary of background data: Low back pain is a common condition with a generally favorable short-term prognosis. Physicians in the acute setting commonly prescribe muscle relaxants. The indications for use and outcomes are not clear. Methods: We performed a secondary data analysis of a cohort of 1633 patients who sought care from a variety of practitioners (primary care, physician of chiropractic, orthopedic surgeon, Health Maintenance Organization) for low back pain. Patients were enrolled in the physician's office and interviewed at baseline, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. Pain, functional status, medication use, health care utilization, and satisfaction with care were assessed. Results: Muscle relaxants were used by 49% of patients; among those who sought care from doctors, 64% used muscle relaxants. Muscle relaxant users were more impaired at baseline. Over time, among patients with greater functional status impairment (Roland disability score &gt; 12) at baseline, muscle relaxant users had somewhat slower recovery from the episode of back pain. This finding persisted after controlling for baseline functional status, age, worker's compensation status, and use of nonsteroidal inflammatory agents.

39,2019,27329976,"Muscle relaxants are commonly prescribed for low back pain (LBP); however, there is limited evidence of their clinical efficacy and tolerability. This review evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of muscle relaxants in people with LBP. We searched online databases including Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL and PsycINFO (inception to end October 2015) and performed citation tracking for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of randomized controlled trials of muscle relaxants. Pain outcomes were converted to a common 0-100 scale. Data were pooled using a random effects model with strength of evidence assessed using GRADE. Fifteen trials (3362 participants) were evaluated in this review. A total of five trials (496 participants) provide high quality evidence that muscle relaxants provide clinically significant pain relief in the short term for acute LBP; MD -21.3, [-29.0, -13.5]. There was no information on long-term outcomes. The median adverse event rate in clinical trials for muscle relaxants was similar to placebo 14.1% IQR (7.0-28.7%) and 16.0% (4.1-31.2%); p = 0.5, respectively. There is no evidence for the efficacy of benzodiazepines in LBP. For people with acute LBP, muscle relaxants provide clinically significant short-term pain relief. For chronic LBP, the efficacy of muscle relaxants is largely unknown. There was no eligible RCT evidence to support the efficacy of benzodiazepines in LBP. Prolonged use of these medicines in LBP cannot be guided by trial evidence. WHAT DOES THIS REVIEW ADD?: Muscle relaxants provide clinically significant pain relief for acute low back pain.

Summary of background data: Despite a long history of use for back pain and musculoskeletal disorders, national prevalence patterns of prescription muscle relaxant use have not been defined. Methods: NHANES III (1988-1994) is an in-person health examination survey of the U.S. civilian population, based on a complex, multistage probability sample design. Results: An estimated 2 million American adults reported muscle relaxant use (1-month period prevalence 1.0%; 95% confidence interval 0.8-1.3%). While virtually all (94%) used individual muscle relaxants rather than fixed combination muscle relaxant analgesics, two thirds took an additional prescription analgesic. Men and women had similar usage. Median user age was 42 years, but 16% of users were older than 60 years. Eighty-five percent of users took muscle relaxants for back pain or muscle disorders. Two thirds of muscle relaxant users had histories of recent back pain; however, only 4% of all those with a recent history of back pain reported any muscle relaxant use. Mean length of use was 2.1 years (95% confidence interval 1.6-2.6), with 44.5% taking medication longer than a year (95% confidence interval 35.7-53.3). Muscle relaxant use in the elderly, among older persons with ambulatory impairments, and in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease appeared undiminished compared with general population use.

39,2019,12804507,"Background: The use of muscle relaxants in the management of non-specific low back pain is controversial. It is not clear if they are effective, and concerns have been raised about the potential adverse effects involved. Objectives: The aim of this review was to determine if muscle relaxants are effective in the treatment of non-specific low back pain. Search strategy: A computer-assisted search of the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 up to October 2001) and EMBASE (1988 up to October 2001) was carried out. These databases were searched using the algorithm recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. References cited in the identified articles and other relevant literature were screened. Selection criteria: Randomised and/or double-blinded controlled trials, involving patients diagnosed with non-specific low back pain, treated with muscle relaxants as monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutic modalities, were included for review. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently carried out the methodological quality assessment and data extraction of the trials. The analysis comprised not only a quantitative analysis (statistical pooling) but also a qualitative analysis (""best evidence synthesis""). This involved the appraisal of the strength of evidence for various conclusions using a rating system based on the quality and outcomes of the studies included. Evidence was classified as ""strong"", ""moderate"", ""limited"", ""conflicting"" or ""no"" evidence. Main results: Thirty trials met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-three trials (77%) were of high quality, 24 trials (80%) were on acute low back pain. Four trials studied benzodiazepines, 11 non-benzodiazepines and two antispasticity muscle relaxants in comparison with placebo. Results showed that there is strong evidence that any of these muscle relaxants are more effective than placebo for patients with acute LBP on short-term pain relief. The pooled RR for non-benzodiazepines versus placebo after two to four days was 0.80 [95% CI; 0.71 to 0.89] for pain relief and 0.49 [95% CI; 0.25 to 0.95] for global efficacy. Adverse events, however, with a relative risk of 1.50 [95% CI; 1.14 to 1.98] were significantly more prevalent in patients receiving muscle relaxants and especially the central nervous system adverse effects (RR 2.04; 95% CI; 1.23 to 3.37). The various muscle relaxants were found to be similar in performance. Reviewer's conclusions: Muscle relaxants are effective in the management of non-specific low back pain, but the adverse effects require that they be used with caution.

If there is a component of neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia, then a trial of one of the gabapentinoids is appropriate. If these steps are inadequate, then an opioid analgesic may be added.

A comprehensive overview of the evidence on pharmacological treatment options for chronic low back pain is lacking. This review evaluates the evidence for the benefits and risks of currently available pharmacological treatments for chronic low back pain. Areas covered: The authors focus on the recent (Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials covering paracetamol (acetaminophen), NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, opioids, and other (new) drugs. Expert opinion: The overall impression of the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for patients with chronic low back pain is rather sobering. The effects on pain reduction and improvement of function are commonly small to moderate and short lasting when compared to placebo. At the same time, the various types of drugs are not without side-effects. This holds especially true for serious side-effects associated with (prolonged) use of strong opioids.

The mechanism and etiology of CLBP are frequently unclear, and treatment choices vary. Materials and methods: The scientific literature, including expert-generated treatment guidelines, was reviewed and evaluated for data regarding CLBP prevalence and predictors and for evidence of outcomes from pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies. Results: Evidence is inconclusive as to superior treatments for CLBP. Even therapies with literature support, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids administered short term, do not work for every patient, and combination therapies are frequently beneficial. Early intervention with acute pain may stop the progression to chronicity in predisposed patients; however, much acute back pain resolves spontaneously. Predictors of chronicity include continuing poor function, unwillingness to remain active, psychiatric comorbidities, general poor health, and maladaptive coping strategies. Indefinite diagnoses and genetic vulnerabilities are likely factors in variable patient outcomes.

The current literature review aims to discuss the evidence of cinnamon administration regarding its hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering effects, summarizing clinical recommendations. Methods: Electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane library, Science Direct and Web of Science were searched with the scientific name of the plant as well as the common name. The search for articles was based on following keywords: ""cinnamon diabetes"", ""cinnamon diabetes type 2"", ""cinnamon and diabetes type 2"", ""Cinnamomum aromaticum"", ""Cinnamomum cassia"", ""Cinnamomum verum"", ""Cinnamomum zeylanicum"". We carried out inclusion criteria between 2003 and 2018 focusing on human studies. Results: Concerning glycemic profile, in individuals with type II diabetes mellitus the fasting blood glucose reduced from 12.9 to 52.2 mg/dL and HbA1c from 0.27 to 0.83%, whereas serum insulin decreased in few studies. Research papers ranged from 6 to 17 weeks in duration. The lipid lowering potential, in turn, is most controversial compared to anti-hyperglycemic potential. Also cinnamon administration has been claimed to reduce fat mass and raise serum antioxidants, but the studies used inaccurate methods. Two species are most investigated, C. cassia/aromaticum, and C.zeylanicum/verum.

Cinnamon significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) level compared to placebo with weighted mean difference (WMD) of -0.545 (95% CI: -0.910, -0.18) mmol/L, I<sup>2</sup> = 83.6% and -0.714(-1.388, -0.04), I<sup>2</sup> = 84.4% respectively. There was no significant change in weighted mean difference of glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) % and lipid profiles (mmol/L). Meta-regression did not show any factor significantly affecting the treatment response. Conclusion: Cinnamon reduced FBG and HOMA-IR, level in T2DM and pre-diabetes patients compared to placebo. High heterogeneity observed among included studies warrants further clinical trials after standardization of cinnamon formulation.",Can cinnamon help people with diabetes?,cinnamon diabetes,0.0,Can cinnamon help people with diabetes?,0.9997209906578064
40,2019,33341863,"Diabetes is on the rise, and has become a major public health issue. In view of limitations of available glucose lowering therapy, there is a need to explore and develop natural remedies with anti-diabetic properties. Spices such as cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, and turmeric display insulin-enhancing activity in vitro. Cinnamon or Dalchini is popularly use as a spice for its fragrance and flavour in wide variety of traditional foods. Among various types of cinnamon, C. zeylanicum is well known as effective substitute for diabetes. Cinnamaldehyde is one of the major constituents (65-80%) of bark oil extracted from C. Zeylonicum which seems to reduce plasma blood glucose concentration more effectively when it is compared with metformin.

40,2019,17381386,"Diabetes mellitus is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and most patients with the disease have type 2 diabetes. The effectiveness of cinnamon supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes has received a great deal of media attention after a study was published in 2003. Although the efficacy of cinnamon in patients with diabetes has not been established, many patients seek other therapies and supplement their prescribed pharmacologic therapy with cinnamon. We conducted a literature search, limited to English-language human studies, using MEDLINE (1966-August 2006), EMBASE (1980-August 2006), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-August 2006), and Iowa Drug Information Service (1966-August 2006). References from articles and clinical trials were reviewed for additional sources; no abstracts were reviewed. We found two prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, peer-reviewed clinical trials and one prospective, placebo-controlled, peer-reviewed clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of cinnamon supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes; a total of 164 patients were involved in these trials. Two of the studies reported modest improvements in lowering blood glucose levels with cinnamon supplementation in small patient samples. One trial showed no significant difference between cinnamon and placebo in lowering blood glucose levels. Overall, cinnamon was well tolerated. These data suggest that cinnamon has a possible modest effect in lowering plasma glucose levels in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.

Quality of evidence: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from January 1966 to August 2008 using the term type 2 diabetes in combination with each of the following terms for specific therapies selected by the authors: cinnamon, fenugreek, gymnema, green tea, fibre, momordica, chromium, and vanadium. Only human clinical trials were selected for review. Main message: Chromium reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels in a large meta-analysis. Gymnema sylvestre reduced HbA(1c) levels in 2 small open-label trials. Cinnamon improved FBG but its effects on HbA(1c) are unknown. Bitter melon had no effect in 2 small trials. Fibre had no consistent effect on HbA(1c) or FBG in 12 small trials. Green tea reduced FBG levels in 1 of 3 small trials. Fenugreek reduced FBG in 1 of 3 small trials. Vanadium reduced FBG in small, uncontrolled trials. There were no trials evaluating microvascular or macrovascular complications or other clinical end points. Conclusion: Chromium, and possibly gymnema, appears to improve glycemic control. Fibre, green tea, and fenugreek have other benefits but there is little evidence that they substantially improve glycemic control. Further research on bitter melon and cinnamon is warranted.

41,2019,26556055,"Background: High-dose benzodiazepine (BZD) dependence is associated with a wide variety of negative health consequences. Affected individuals are reported to suffer from severe mental disorders and are often unable to achieve long-term abstinence via recommended discontinuation strategies. Although it is increasingly understood that treatment interventions should take subjective experiences and beliefs into account, the perceptions of this group of individuals remain under-investigated. Methods: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 41 adult subjects meeting criteria for (high-dose) BZD-dependence, as defined by ICD-10. One-on-one in-depth interviews allowed for an exploration of this group's views on the reasons behind their initial and then continued use of BZDs, as well as their procurement strategies. Mayring's qualitative content analysis was used to evaluate our data. Results: In this sample, all participants had developed explanatory models for why they began using BZDs. We identified a multitude of reasons that we grouped into four broad categories, as explaining continued BZD use: (1) to cope with symptoms of psychological distress or mental disorder other than substance use, (2) to manage symptoms of physical or psychological discomfort associated with somatic disorder, (3) to alleviate symptoms of substance-related disorders, and (4) for recreational purposes, that is, sensation-seeking and other social reasons. Subjects often considered BZDs less dangerous than other substances and associated their use more often with harm reduction than as recreational. Specific obtainment strategies varied widely: the majority of participants oscillated between legal and illegal methods, often relying on the black market when faced with treatment termination. Conclusions: Irrespective of comorbidity, participants expressed a clear preference for medically related explanatory models for their BZD use. We therefore suggest that clinicians consider patients' motives for long-term, high-dose BZD use when formulating treatment plans for this patient group, especially since it is known that individuals are more compliant with approaches they perceive to be manageable, tolerable, and effective.",Can benzos (benzodiazepines) help with alcohol withdrawal?,benzos alcohol withdrawal,1.0,Can benzos (benzodiazepines) help with alcohol withdrawal?,0.8170033693313599
41,2019,12065157,"A benzoflavone moiety has been reported recently to be responsible for the multifarious CNS effects of Passiflora incarnata Linneaus. In the light of the established usefulness of the benzoflavone moiety in counteracting the withdrawal effects of substances like morphine, cannabinoids and nicotine by the authors, the bioactive benzoflavone moiety (BZF) has been tested in mice treated with an addictive dose (2 g/kg, bid for 6 days) of ethyl alcohol, in order to evaluate its effectiveness in countering alcohol dependence. In a 7-day regimen, different groups of mice were administered vehicle, alcohol and alcohol+three doses (10, 20 and 50 mg/kg of the benzoflavone moiety) of P. incarnata; all treatments (chronic) being administered orally, twice daily for 6 days. Similarly, three other groups of mice were rendered addicts upon alcohol by administration of the addictive dose (2 g/kg, bid for 6 days) of ethyl alcohol, and a single acute administration of 10, 20 and 50 mg/kg dose of benzoflavone moiety was given on the 7th day. In both, chronic and acute administrations, the benzoflavone moiety prevented significantly the expression of withdrawal effects of alcohol as there was a significant decrease in anxiety oriented behavior in mice that received benzoflavone moiety of P. incarnata.

41,2019,18188105,"Background: Although benzodiazepines are the recommended first-line therapy for the prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), the administration of intravenous ethanol as an alternative prophylactic agent persists in many surgical ICUs. Advocates of this therapy argue that ethanol provides effective prophylaxis against AWS without the excessive sedation observed with benzodiazepine therapy. No study to date, however, has compared the two therapies with regard to their sedative effects. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of intravenous ethanol compared with benzodiazepines for the prevention of AWS with particular emphasis on the sedative effects of each therapy. Methods: During a 15-month period, trauma patients admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic daily alcohol consumption greater than or equal to five beverage equivalents per day were prospectively randomized to one of two 4-day prophylactic regimens: intravenous ethanol infusion (EtOH) versus scheduled-dose diazepam (BENZO). Patients were evaluated with the Riker sedation-agitation scale, a 7-point instrument for the subjective assessment of both sedation (1 = unarousable) and agitation (7 = dangerous agitation). According to protocol, regimens were titrated to achieve and maintain a Riker score of 4 (calm and cooperative). Deviation from a score of 4 during the course of treatment was compared between groups. Results: Fifty patients met study criteria and were randomized after obtainment of informed consent (EtOH, n = 26; BENZO, n = 24). Overall, the EtOH group had a significantly greater proportion of patients who deviated from a score of 4 during the course of treatment (p = 0.020). In both groups, the majority of deviation from a score of 4 reflected periods of under-sedation rather than over-sedation. One patient in the EtOH group failed treatment, requiring diazepam and haloperidol for control of AWS symptoms as per protocol, whereas no patient in the BENZO group failed treatment (p = NS). Conclusion: Concerning the prophylaxis of AWS, intravenous ethanol offers no advantage over diazepam with respect to efficacy or adverse sedative effects. The purported benefit of intravenous ethanol as a prophylactic agent against AWS was not evident.",Can benzos (benzodiazepines) help with alcohol withdrawal?,benzos alcohol withdrawal,1.0,Can benzos (benzodiazepines) help with alcohol withdrawal?,0.8761301636695862

In American literature the severity of withdrawal is recorded using the CIWA-A scale (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment--Alcohol). The pathophysiological causes lie in an imbalance between the inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters after giving up alcohol. This results in predomination by the excitatory system. Therapeutic intervention is possible here. Clomethiazole has effective sedative actions, stabilises the autonomic nervous system, and is an anticonvulsant. It is the drug of choice for autonomic withdrawal and predelirium. The benzodlazepines have a similar effect, but cannot be controlled so accurately.

Infants were exclusively breast-fed during the first 3 months, and were subsequently fed with breastmilk or cow's milk formula from 4 to 6 months of age. Clinical symptoms of the infants were monitored until 1 yr of age, when the total and specific IgE against common food allergens were measured. A total of 68 infants completed the study. The prevalence of eczema at 1 yr in the probiotic group was significantly lower than in the placebo group (18.2% vs. 40.0%, p=0.048).

42,2019,30480774,"Background: Eczema is a common chronic skin condition. Probiotics have been proposed as an effective treatment for eczema; their use is increasing, as numerous clinical trials are under way. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2008, which suggested that probiotics may not be an effective treatment for eczema but identified areas in which evidence was lacking. Objectives: To assess the effects of probiotics for treating patients of all ages with eczema. Search methods: We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, the Global Resource of Eczema Trials (GREAT) database, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also handsearched a number of conference proceedings. We updated the searches of the main databases in January 2018 and of trials registries in March 2018, but we have not yet incorporated these results into the review. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of probiotics (live orally ingested micro-organisms) compared with no treatment, placebo, or other active intervention with no probiotics for the treatment of eczema diagnosed by a doctor. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. We recorded adverse events from the included studies and from a separate adverse events search conducted for the first review. We formally assessed reporting bias by preparing funnel plots, and we performed trial sequential analysis for the first primary outcome - eczema symptoms at the end of active treatment.We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome (in italic font). Main results: We included 39 randomised controlled trials involving 2599 randomised participants. We included participants of either gender, aged from the first year of life through to 55 years (only six studies assessed adults), who had mild to severe eczema. Trials were undertaken in primary and secondary healthcare settings, mainly in Europe or Asia. Duration of treatment ranged from four weeks to six months, and duration of follow-up after end of treatment ranged from zero to 36 months. We selected no standard dose: researchers used a variety of doses and concentrations of probiotics. The probiotics used were bacteria of the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria species, which were taken alone or combined with other probiotics, and were given with or without prebiotics. Comparators were no treatment, placebo, and other treatments with no probiotics.For all results described in this abstract, the comparator was no probiotics. Active treatment ranged from six weeks to three months for all of the following results, apart from the investigator-rated eczema severity outcome, for which the upper limit of active treatment was 16 weeks. With regard to score, the higher the score, the more severe were the symptoms. All key results reported in this abstract were measured at the end of active treatment, except for adverse events, which were measured during the active treatment period.Probiotics probably make little or no difference in participant- or parent-rated symptoms of eczema (13 trials; 754 participants): symptom severity on a scale from 0 to 20 was 0.44 points lower after probiotic treatment (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.22 to 0.33; moderate-quality evidence). Trial sequential analysis shows that target sample sizes of 258 and 456, which are necessary to demonstrate a minimum mean difference of -2 and -1.5, respectively, with 90% power, have been exceeded, suggesting that further trials with similar probiotic strains for this outcome at the end of active treatment may be futile.We found no evidence suggesting that probiotics make a difference in QoL for patients with eczema (six studies; 552 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.03, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.42; low-quality evidence) when measured by the participant or the parent using validated disease-specific QoL instruments.Probiotics may slightly reduce investigator-rated eczema severity scores (24 trials; 1596 participants). On a scale of 0 to 103 for total Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), a score combining investigator-rated eczema severity score and participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss was 3.91 points lower after probiotic treatment than after no probiotic treatment (95% CI -5.86 to -1.96; low-quality evidence). The minimum clinically important difference for SCORAD has been estimated to be 8.7 points.We noted significant to extreme levels of unexplainable heterogeneity between the results of individual studies. We judged most studies to be at unclear risk of bias; six studies had high attrition bias, and nine were at low risk of bias overall.We found no evidence to show that probiotics make a difference in the risk of adverse events during active treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.63; seven trials; 402 participants; low-quality evidence). Studies in our review that reported adverse effects described gastrointestinal symptoms. Authors' conclusions: Evidence suggests that, compared with no probiotic, currently available probiotic strains probably make little or no difference in improving patient-rated eczema symptoms. Probiotics may make little or no difference in QoL for people with eczema nor in investigator-rated eczema severity score (combined with participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss); for the latter, the observed effect was small and of uncertain clinical significance. Therefore, use of probiotics for the treatment of eczema is currently not evidence-based. This update found no evidence of increased adverse effects with probiotic use during studies, but a separate adverse events search from the first review revealed that probiotic treatment carries a small risk of adverse events.Results show significant, unexplainable heterogeneity between individual trial results. Only a small number of studies measured some outcomes.Future studies should better measure QoL scores and adverse events, and should report on new probiotics. Researchers should also consider studying subgroups of patients (e.g. patients with atopy or food allergies, adults) and standardising doses/concentrations of probiotics given.",Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,0.23682203888893127
42,2019,19573037,"Background: Probiotics have been proposed as a treatment for eczema, but the results of intervention trials have been mixed. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of probiotics for treating eczema by performing a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Design: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, LILACS, ISI Web of Science, the reference lists of articles, ongoing clinical trial registers and conference proceedings. RCTs of live orally ingested microorganisms for the treatment of eczema were eligible for inclusion. Results: Twelve trials (781 participants) were identified. Meta-analysis of data from five of these trials showed that there was no significant reduction in eczema symptoms with probiotic treatment compared with placebo (mean difference -0.90 points on a 20-point visual analogue scale; 95% confidence interval -2.84, 1.04). Meta-analysis of data from seven trials showed no significant difference in investigator rated eczema severity between probiotic and placebo treatments. Subgroup analysis by eczema severity or presence of atopy did not identify a specific population in which probiotic treatment was effective. There was significant heterogeneity between studies; however, the results of three studies that used the same probiotic strain were concordant. The adverse events search identified case reports of sepsis and bowel ischaemia caused by probiotics. Conclusions: Currently, probiotics cannot be recommended for treating eczema. The heterogeneity between studies may be attributable to probiotic strain-specific effects, which means that novel probiotic strains may still have a role in eczema management.",Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,0.28484591841697693
42,2019,17349686,"Background: An altered microbial exposure may underlie the increase of allergic diseases in affluent societies. Probiotics may alleviate and even prevent eczema in infants. Objective: To prevent eczema and sensitization in infants with a family history of allergic disease by oral supplementation with the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri. Methods: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, which comprised 232 families with allergic disease, of whom 188 completed the study. The mothers received L reuteri ATCC 55730 (1 x 10(8) colony forming units) daily from gestational week 36 until delivery. Their babies then continued with the same product from birth until 12 months of age and were followed up for another year. Primary outcome was allergic disease, with or without positive skin prick test or circulating IgE to food allergens. Results: The cumulative incidence of eczema was similar, 36% in the treated versus 34% in the placebo group. The L reuteri group had less IgE-associated eczema during the second year, 8% versus 20% (P = .02), however. Skin prick test reactivity was also less common in the treated than in the placebo group, significantly so for infants with mothers with allergies, 14% versus 31% (P = .02). Wheeze and other potentially allergic diseases were not affected. Conclusion: Although a preventive effect of probiotics on infant eczema was not confirmed, the treated infants had less IgE-associated eczema at 2 years of age and therefore possibly run a reduced risk to develop later respiratory allergic disease. Clinical implication: Probiotics may reduce the incidence of IgE-associated eczema in infancy.",Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,0.9209202527999878
42,2019,19298231,"A reduced microbial load early in life has been suggested to be linked to the increasing prevalence of allergic diseases in the industrialized world. Some studies have indicated that probiotics may be effective in the prevention of eczema. In vitro studies indicate that probiotics have immunomodulatory effects. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of feeding Lactobacillus F19 during weaning on the incidence of eczema and Th1/Th2 balance. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized intervention trial, infants were fed cereals with (n = 89) or without Lactobacillus F19 (n = 90) from 4 to 13 months of age. We assessed the cumulative incidence of eczema at 13 months of age. The ratio of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to interleukin 4 (IL4) mRNA expression levels in polyclonally stimulated peripheral blood T cells was used as a proxy for immune balance. Total and specific IgE serum levels were also assessed. The cumulative incidence of eczema at 13 months was 11% (4-17%, 95% CI) and 22% (13-31%, 95% CI) in the probiotic and placebo groups, respectively (p 0.05). The number needed to treat was 9 (6.5-11.5, 95% CI). At 13 months of age, the IFN-gamma/IL4 mRNA ratio was higher in the probiotic compared with the placebo group (p 0.05). In contrast, there were no differences between groups in serum concentrations of IgE. In summary, feeding Lactobacillus F19 during weaning could be an effective tool in the prevention of early manifestation of allergy, e.g., eczema. The higher Th1/Th2 ratio in the probiotic compared with the placebo group suggests enhancing effects of Lactobacillus F19 on the T cell-mediated immune response.",Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,0.9274279475212097
42,2019,23574636,"The increasing prevalence of allergic disease has been linked to reduced microbial exposure in early life. Probiotics have recently been advocated for the prevention and treatment of allergic disease. This article summarises recent publications on probiotics in allergic disease, focusing on clinical studies of prevention or treatment of allergic disease. Studies employing the combined administration of pre-natal and post-natal probiotics suggest a role for certain probiotics (alone or with prebiotics) in the prevention of eczema in early childhood, with the pre-natal component of treatment appearing to be important for beneficial effects. On the other hand, current data are insufficient to support the use of probiotics for the treatment of established allergic disease, although recent studies have highlighted new hope in this area.

42,2019,23594506,"Purpose of review: To describe the current literature on clinical trials of probiotics for eczema and food allergy prevention in view of recent new approaches and long-term follow-ups. Recent findings: Attempting allergy prevention by probiotic administration has been most successful when assessing atopic eczema, the most prevalent allergic disease at an early age. More than half of the published studies demonstrate a decrease in eczema prevalence until 2 years, whereas the remaining studies fail to show an effect. Effects have been most consistent with combined prenatal and direct postnatal supplementation of the infant and appear strain-specific, with Lactobacillus rhamnosus most often showing an effect. Prenatal-only and postnatal-only studies often fail to show effects. Recent long-time follow-ups have shown promising but not consistent results. A very recent follow-up of a large well conducted cohort shows that long-term effects of eczema prevention persists until age 4 and prevention of respiratory allergies might also be possible. Summary: Prevention of eczema with probiotics seem to work until age 2 years and extended effects until 4 years have been shown in high-risk for allergy cohorts. Effects are strain-specific, with L. rhamnosus showing the most consistent effects especially when combining pre and postnatal administration.",Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,0.999758780002594
42,2019,18206506,"Background: Prenatal and postnatal probiotic supplementation for prevention and treatment of pediatric atopic dermatitis (PAD) has been studied in clinical trials, but results have been mixed and hindered by heterogeneity of study design. Objectives: To summarize and interpret quantitatively clinical trial findings on the efficacy of probiotics for PAD and to define key trial features correlating with high methodologic quality. Methods: PubMed and Cochrane database searches yielded 21 trials (n = 1898; age 0-13 y) published between February 1997 and May 2007 for review and quality assessment. Ten double-blind randomized controlled clinical trials were meta-analyzed by using RevMan. Data from the 6 prevention studies (n = 1581) and 4 treatment trials (n = 299) were pooled by using fixed-effects and random-effects models of relative risk ratios and of weighted mean difference, respectively. Results: Prevention corresponded with summary effect sizes of 0.69 (0.57, 0.83) and 0.66 (0.49, 0.89), respectively, supporting probiotics' PAD prevention potential, which decreased further to 0.61 after exclusion of the 1 trial of postnatal-only probiotics. The clinical significance of the treatment trial findings of intergroup Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (quantification of PAD severity) score reduction by -6.64 points (-9.78, -3.49) and -8.56 (-18.39, 1.28), and intragroup change of -1.06 (-3.86, 1.73) and -1.37 (-4.81, 2.07), is questionable.

44,2019,15846704,"Background: Vitamins have been reported to be effective in controlling certain types of seizures and to prevent some of the harmful effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In this review we will summarize evidence from randomized controlled trials. Objectives: To assess if vitamins improve seizure control, reduce adverse effects of AEDs or improve the quality of life in people with epilepsy. Search strategy: We searched MEDLINE from 1966 to 2004, the Cochrane Epilepsy Group trials register (December 2004), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register) (TheCochraneLibrary Issue 4, 2004), and cross-references from identified studies. Selection criteria: Randomized or quasi-randomized studies investigating the effects of one or more vitamins given alone or in addition to AEDs to people of any age with any type of epilepsy. Data collection and analysis: Both reviewers assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted the data. Outcomes assessed included seizure frequency, gingival hyperplasia, neuropathy, changes in bone mineral content, serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, hemogram, serum levels of AEDs, neuropsychological and quality of life outcomes. Primary analyses were by intention to treat. Main results: Fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria and were of poor methodological quality. None described randomization methods and most enrolled small numbers of participants. Nine studies (331 participants) investigated folic acid. Two studies (75 participants) found no effect for the outcome 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.32 to 2.29). Also, no evidence was found for an effect on gingival health, intelligence, behavior, mental health or personality, or measures of red blood volume and hemoglobin content. Folic acid was not associated with any consistent changes in serum phenytoin or phenobarbitone levels or improvement in the mean motor conduction velocities of peripheral nerves. One small study (72 participants) found that thiamine improves neuropsychological functions related to psychomotor speed, visuospatial abilities, selective attention and verbal abstracting ability. One study (226 participants) found a significantly higher bone mineral content (BMC) among patients with epilepsy taking AEDs with vitamin D supplementation compared to controls who were not given supplementation (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.48 to 4.72; p 0.00001). The studies found no significant effects on serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase or general well-being. One small study (24 participants) found a significant decrease in seizure frequency in those treated with vitamin E compared to placebo (p = 0.00005; Peto OR 26.73; 95% CI 5.46 to 130.92). Authors' conclusions: In view of methodological deficiencies and limited number of individual studies, we have found no reliable evidence to support the routine use of vitamins in patients with epilepsy. Further trials are needed, especially to assess the utility of vitamin D supplementation to prevent osteomalacia and the role of vitamin E on seizures and thiamine in improving cognitive functions.",Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,vitamins epilepsy,0.0,Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,0.7888781428337097

These EEG changes were detected incidentally and were not associated with any clinical manifestation; they disappeared progressively within several weeks after discontinuation of vitamin therapy. In our opinion, it is likely that the treatment with B vitamins was entirely responsible for the EEG changes, as one of the patients did not receive any other drug, while the other did not show any significant change of PB and CBZ plasma levels during vitamin therapy.

44,2019,33748042,"Objective: To characterize the electro-clinical presentation of patients with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent epilepsy in order to determine whether some of them could be diagnosed as de novo West syndrome, i. e., West syndrome that starts after the age of 2 months without other types of seizures (focal seizures for instance) before the onset of epileptic spasms. Methods: We analyzed data from an unpublished cohort of 28 genetically confirmed cases of PDE with antiquitine (ATQ) deficiency and performed a review of the literature looking for description of West syndrome in patients with either PDE with ATQ deficiency or PLP-dependent epilepsy with Pyridox(am)ine phosphate oxidase (PNPO) deficiency. Results: Of the 28 cases from the ATQ deficiency French cohort, 5 had spasms. In four cases, spasms were associated with other types of seizures (myoclonus, focal seizures). In the last case, seizures started on the day of birth. None of these cases corresponded to de novo West syndrome. The review of the literature found only one case of PNPO deficiency presenting as de novo West syndrome and no case of ATQ deficiency. Significance: The presentation of PDE- and PLP-dependent epilepsy as de novo West syndrome is so exceptional that it probably does not justify a systematic trial of pyridoxine or PLP. We propose considering a therapeutic trial with these vitamins in West syndrome if spasms are associated with other seizure types or start before the age of 2 months.",Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,vitamins epilepsy,0.0,Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,0.6445425748825073
44,2019,35320056,"Introduction: Antiseizure medications (ASMs) are the primary treatment option for epilepsies of wide etiologies, however, about 10-20% of children do not gain sustained seizure control and in this case, it is worth investigating 'alternative' therapeutic approaches aside from ASMs. Nowadays, non-pharmacological strategies for epilepsy treatment encompass dietary interventions, neurostimulation-based techniques, and biobehavioral approaches. Areas covered: A search on PubMed database was conducted. Experimental and clinical studies, as well as meta-analysis and structured reviews on the latest non-pharmacological treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) in children, were included. Special attention is given to the efficacy and tolerability outcomes, trying to infer the role novel approaches may have in the future. Expert opinion: The large heterogeneity of primary clinical outcomes and the unavoidable subjective response of each patient to treatments prevents Researchers from the identification of a single, reliable, approach to treat DRE. The understanding of fine pathophysiologic processes is giving the way to the use of alternative therapies, such as the well-known ketogenic diet, in a 'personalized' view of treatment.

The goal of this cross-sectional study was to compare the nutrient intake of children 1 to 8 years of age with intractable epilepsy to healthy children of the same age from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001 to 2002 (N=1,718) and with the Dietary Reference Intakes. Children with intractable epilepsy were divided into two age groups: 1.0 to 3.9 and 4.0 to 8.9 years, to correspond with the Dietary Reference Intakes. Forty-three children with intractable epilepsy, mean age=4.7+/-2.2 years, had significantly lower intakes (P 0.05) of total energy; protein; carbohydrate; fat; dietary fiber; vitamins A, E, B-6, and B-12; riboflavin; niacin; folate; calcium; phosphorus; magnesium; zinc; copper; and selenium compared with healthy children. Thirty percent or more of the children with intractable epilepsy in both age groups had intakes below the Recommended Dietary Allowance or Adequate Intake for vitamins D, E, and K; folate; calcium; linoleic acid; and alpha-linolenic acid.

44,2019,20201711,"Importance of the field: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder associated with several comorbidities, one of them being reduced bone health. As the bone loss most often is insidious and asymptomatic, they are usually not recognized, and thus untreated. The key message of this paper is to make clinicians aware of the problem. Areas covered in this review: This article reviews data from basic and clinical studies of bone loss associated with usage of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) within the last 4 decades. What the reader will gain: The reader will learn that there is accumulating evidence of biochemical abnormalities indicating a disturbed bone metabolism, a decreased bone density and a 2 - 6 times increased risk of fractures among those with epilepsy compared to the general population. These findings most likely have many causes, both internal and external, but long-term use of AEDs seems to play an important role. Enzyme-inducing drugs, such as phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine, but also the enzyme inhibitor valproate, appear to have bone-depleting properties. Reduced bone density may be detected during the first 1 - 5 years of treatment. Although many theories have been launched, the exact mechanisms by which the the drugs affect bone architecture are not fully understood. Take home message: We recommend clinicians to promote osteoprotective behavior among their epilepsy patients; that is, sunlight exposure and weight-bearing exercise as well as avoidance of risk factors such as bone-depleting drugs other than AEDs, smoking and heavy alcohol consumption. Enzyme inducing drugs should be avoided, if possible. Bone mineral density screening should be assessed on an individual basis, taking risk factors for bone loss into account. All patients taking AEDs on long-term basis ought to have adequate amounts of dietary calcium and vitamin D, and those who have developed bone loss should in addition be given specific antiosteoporotic treatment.",Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,vitamins epilepsy,0.0,Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,0.9013240933418274

Methods: This prospective study included 490 patients receiving care at a university epilepsy clinic. A number of variables, including demographics, characteristics of epilepsy and its treatment, comedication as well as data related to supplements intake were collected from medical records and a dedicated questionnaire. Results: Overall 247 patients (50.4%) took at least one dietary supplement; nearly half (111, 44.9%) of this group took &gt;1 products. Multivitamins and magnesium were the most prevalent supplements. Most of the patients used supplements for general health rather than their epilepsy condition. The average number of supplements and prescription medications used per person was 5.4. Ten percent (25 of 247) of subjects used dietary supplements which could have proconvulsive effect or potential for interaction with prescription medications. Multivariate analysis revealed two independent variables associated with supplements intake, younger age and female sex. Conclusion: Dietary and herbal supplements use is common in patients with epilepsy, adding to the burden of overmedication.

Methods: MEDLINE and Scopus from inception to August 25, 2020 were searched for related published manuscripts. The search keywords included ""vitamin or folate or folic acid or biotin or thiamine or carnitine or zinc or manganese or selenium or omega-3 fatty acid or linoleic acid or micronutrient or trace element or supplementation"" AND ""epilepsy or seizure"". Results: We could identify 26 related articles. Seventeen studies provided class 2 of evidence and the rest provided class 3 of evidence. Eight studies investigated polyunsaturated fats, seven groups studied folic acid, four studies explored the effects of vitamin D, two investigated vitamin E, and three others studied multivitamin cocktails. There was one study on zinc and one on selenium. There is some evidence on the efficacy of polyunsaturated fats in treating seizures in PWE. The evidence on the efficacy of multivitamin cocktails in adults is promising. Conclusion: High quality data on the efficacy of nutritional (vitamins-minerals) supplementations in treating seizures in PWE is scarce; however, designing future clinical trials of polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for drug-resistant seizures in adults with focal epilepsy and in children, and also multivitamin supplementations in adults with focal epilepsy seems reasonable and promising.

45,2019,33407842,"Caffeine and catechin, contained in coffee and tea, are commonly consumed substances worldwide. Studies revealed their health promoting functions, such as anti-oxidant, anti-cancer and anti-bacterial properties. Additionally, studies also revealed their roles in ameliorating the symptoms of allergic disorders, indicating their anti-allergic properties. In the present study, using the differential-interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, we examined the effects of caffeine and catechin on the degranulation from rat peritoneal mast cells. Both caffeine and catechin dose-dependently decreased the numbers of degranulating mast cells. At concentrations equal to or higher than 25 mM, caffeine and catechin markedly suppressed the numbers of degranulating mast cells. In contrast, at relatively lower concentrations, both substances did not significantly affect the numbers of degranulating mast cells. However, surprisingly enough, low concentrations of catechin (1, 2.5 mM) synergistically enhanced the suppressive effect of 10 mM caffeine on mast cell degranulation. These results provided direct evidence for the first time that caffeine and catechin dose-dependently inhibited the process of exocytosis. At relatively lower concentrations, caffeine or catechin alone did not stabilize mast cells.

We examined the relation between urinary levels of caffeine or caffeine metabolites and asthma, lung function, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in adults. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 2,832 adults aged 18-79 years in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Multivariable logistic or linear regression was used for the analysis of urinary levels of caffeine or each of its three major metabolites (paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline) and current asthma, lung function, and FeNO. Results: Subjects with urinary paraxanthine levels in the fourth quartile (Q4) had 53% lower odds of current asthma than those whose urinary paraxanthine levels were in the first quartile (Q1; 95% confidence = 0.22 to 1.00). Among never and former smokers, subjects with urinary theophylline levels above Q1 had 49% lower odds of current asthma than those whose urinary theophylline level was in Q1 (95% CI = 0.31 to 0.85). Among subjects without current asthma, each log 10 -unit increment in paraxanthine level was associated with a 0.83% increment in percent predicted (%pred) FEV 1 and a 1.27% increment in %pred FVC, while each log 10 -unit in theophylline was associated with a 1.24% increment in %pred FVC.

45,2019,20091514,"Background: Caffeine has a variety of pharmacological effects; it is a weak bronchodilator and it also reduces respiratory muscle fatigue. It is chemically related to the drug theophylline which is used to treat asthma. It has been suggested that caffeine may reduce asthma symptoms and interest has been expressed in its potential role as an asthma treatment. A number of studies have explored the effects of caffeine in asthma, this is the first review to systematically examine and summarise the evidence. Objectives: To assess the effects of caffeine on lung function and identify whether there is a need to control for caffeine consumption prior to either lung function or exhaled nitric oxide testing. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and the reference lists of articles (August 2009). We also contacted study authors. Selection criteria: Randomised clinical trials of oral caffeine compared to placebo or coffee compared to decaffeinated coffee in adults with asthma. Data collection and analysis: Trial selection, quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers. Main results: Seven trials involving a total of 75 people with mild to moderate asthma were included. The studies were all of cross-over design .Six trials involving 55 people showed that in comparison with placebo, caffeine, even at a 'low dose' ( 5mg/kg body weight), appears to improve lung function for up to two hours after consumption. Forced expiratory volume in one minute showed a small improvement up to two hours after caffeine ingestion (SMD 0.72; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.20), which translates into a 5% mean difference in FEV1. However in two studies the mean differences in FEV1 were 12% and 18% after caffeine. Mid-expiratory flow rates also showed a small improvement with caffeine and this was sustained up to four hours.One trial involving 20 people examined the effect of drinking coffee versus a decaffeinated variety on the exhaled nitric oxide levels in patients with asthma and concluded that there was no significant effect on this outcome. Authors' conclusions: Caffeine appears to improve airways function modestly, for up to four hours, in people with asthma . People may need to avoid caffeine for at least four hours prior to lung function testing, as caffeine ingestion could cause misinterpretation of the results. Drinking caffeinated coffee before taking exhaled nitric oxide measurements does not appear to affect the results of the test, but more studies are needed to confirm this.",Can caffeine help people with asthma?,caffeine asthma,1.0,Can caffeine help people with asthma?,0.25999748706817627
45,2019,6700656,"We compared the bronchodilator effects and pharmacokinetics of orally administered caffeine (10 mg per kilogram of body weight) and theophylline (5 mg per kilogram) in a double-blind, single-dose study in asthmatic patients 8 to 18 years of age. After 48 hours of withdrawal of all methylxanthines, 13 patients received caffeine and 10 received theophylline. Significant improvements in forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced expiratory flow rates occurred from one to six hours after administration of either caffeine or theophylline. The bronchodilator effect of caffeine did not differ significantly from that of theophylline and was maximal two hours after ingestion of each drug. Peak serum levels of caffeine (13.5 +/- 2.9 mg per liter) occurred at one hour, and peak levels of theophylline (8.4 +/- 1.7 mg per liter) at 2.2 +/- 0.8 hours. The mean serum half-time for caffeine was 3.9 +/- 1.4 hours and that for theophylline was 5.8 +/- 1.7 hours. All patients receiving caffeine metabolized it to paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline. Mild, transient side effects were seen after both caffeine and theophylline. Vital signs did not change significantly after either drug. We conclude that caffeine, a commonly available chemical, is an effective bronchodilator in young patients with asthma.",Can caffeine help people with asthma?,caffeine asthma,1.0,Can caffeine help people with asthma?,0.8329476118087769

The patients received either placebo or 5 mg/kg of caffeine in solution orally, and FEV1, FVC, FEF25-75, Vmax25 and blood for caffeine concentrations were taken at several time points for as long as 8 h after the drink. Results: there was a significant difference between caffeine and placebo for percent change in FEV1 with peak change at 1.5 h. There was also a significant difference for percent change in FEF25-75 with peak occurring at 4 h. Percent change in Vmax25 was significantly different at 3.0 h only. Peak caffeine concentration of 8.7 +/- 1.7 micrograms/ml occurred at 1 h.

45,2019,21726992,"Background: The bronchoprotective effect of caffeine on histamine challenge testing (HCT) has been studied with equivocal results. Current guidelines for bronchoprovocation testing recommend exclusion of caffeine the day of testing. The effects of caffeine on methacholine challenge testing (MCT), now more commonly performed than histamine challenge, are unknown. Methods: Sixteen well-controlled asthmatics with a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) &gt; 65% predicted and methacholine provocation concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)) ≤ 16 mg/ml participated in a randomized single-blind crossover study. The two treatments included 16 ounces of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee given on two separate days. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and FEV(1) were measured before and 1 h after each treatment. One hour post treatment blood was drawn for serum caffeine level and the MCT was done. Results: Fourteen subjects completed the study; there were no adverse events. No significant bronchodilation was seen between the mean FEV(1) values before and after the caffeinated treatment (3.31 ± 0.75 L and 3.36 ± 0.74 L, respectively). No significant bronchoprotection was seen between the caffeinated and decaffeinated treatment's geometric mean PC(20) values (1.35 mg/ml and 1.36 mg/ml, respectively). Mean eNO values before and after caffeinated treatment were not significantly different (31.2 ± 19.6 ppb and 31.5 ± 20.4 ppb). Conclusion: The amount of caffeine in a normal dietary serving of a 16 oz cup of coffee is not enough to cause significant bronchoprotection, bronchodilation, or decrease eNO values.

The high incidence of back pain and the popularity of shoe insoles call for a systematic review of this practice. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of shoe insoles in the prevention and treatment of non-specific back pain compared to placebo, no intervention, or other interventions. Search strategy: We searched the following databases: The Cochrane Back Group Trials Register and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to March 2005, and MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to February 2007; reviewed reference lists in review articles, guidelines and in the included trials; conducted citation tracking; contacted individuals with expertise in this domain. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials that examined the use of customized or non-customized insoles, for the prevention or treatment of back pain, compared to placebo, no intervention or other interventions. Study outcomes had to include at least one of the following: self-reported incidence or physician diagnosis of back pain; pain intensity; duration of back pain; absenteeism; functional status. Studies of insoles designed to treat limb length inequality were excluded. Data collection and analysis: One review author conducted the searches and blinded the retrieved references for authors, institution and journal. Two review authors independently selected the relevant articles. Two different review authors independently assessed the methodological quality and clinical relevance and extracted the data from each trial using a standardized form.

47,2019,24053218,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between low back pain and lower extremity pain in a group of factory workers and determine the effect of cushioning insoles on low back pain and lower extremity pain. Data were gathered via questionnaire from 306 employees of an aircraft engine assembly factory. A subset of 40 workers who had reported significant levels of back or lower extremity pain were sampled for four consecutive 12-hour shifts wearing their normal footwear and then a week later for four consecutive shifts wearing cushioning insoles. High levels of low back pain and lower extremity pain were reported by workers on the plant floor, but low back pain was poorly correlated to lower extremity pain (r = 0.371). The effect of insoles on the subset of 40 workers was to lower low back pain by 38%, foot pain by 37%, and knee pain by 38% (p .001). The reduction in low back pain, however, was not correlated to the reduction in lower extremity pain; workers reporting a decrease in low back pain differed from those reporting less lower extremity pain.",Can insoles treat back pain?,insoles back pain,0.0,Can insoles treat back pain?,0.6806766390800476
47,2019,15668775,"The prevalence and incidence of low back pain in general society is high. Workers whose job involves walking long distances have an even higher tendency to suffer from low back pain. A positive effect of insoles in reducing low back pain was found in professional sports players. This was not examined on people whose job involves walking long distances. In this double blind prospective study we examined the effectiveness of insoles constructed in a computerized method to placebo insoles in 58 employees whose work entailed extensive walking and who suffered from low back pain. The evaluation was performed by the MILLION questionnaire, which is considered as a valid questionnaire for evaluation of low back pain. We calculated the differences of the pain intensity before and after the intervention, in the employees using the insoles manufactured by computer in comparison to the users of the placebo insoles. In each group, the analysis was performed in comparison to the baseline. A total of 81% of the employees preferred the real insoles as effective and comfortable in comparison to 19% of the users of the placebo insoles (P 0.05). The results of this study indicate a substantial improvement in the low back pain after the use of the true insoles. The average pain intensity according to the MILLION questionnaire before the use of the insoles was 5.46. However, after the use of the real insoles and the placebo insoles, the average pain intensity decreased to 3.96 and 5.11, respectively. The difference of the average pain intensity at the start of the study and after the use of the real insoles was significant: -1.49 (P=0.0001), whereas this difference after the use of the placebo insoles was not significant: -0.31 (P=0.1189). The reported severity of pain also decreased significantly: a level 5 pain and above was reported by 77% of the subjects at the start of the study. After the use of the real insoles only 37.9% of the subjects reported a similar degree of pain severity, and 50% of the subjects did so after the use of the placebo insoles (P 0.05). We did not find a link between low back pain and other variables such as gender, age, number of offspring, work seniority, smoking, previous use of insoles and previous medication.

Insoles are often prescribed to reduce the pain which, in turn, may promote return to normal activities. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of insoles on foot pain and daily activities, and to investigate the relationship between individuals' satisfaction with insoles and actual use of them. Study design: A 4-week pre-post intervention follow-up. Methods: Brief Pain Inventory, International Physical Activity Questionnaire and Lower Extremities Functional Status were used as outcome measures. Client Satisfaction with Device was used in the follow-up. Results: A total of 67 participants answered the questionnaires (81% women). Overall, a reduction in Pain Severity (p = 0.002) and Pain Interference (p = 0.008) was shown. Secondary analyses revealed a significant effect only in women. No changes in daily activities (Walking, p = 0.867; Total Physical Activity, p = 0.842; Lower Extremities Functional Status, p = 0.939) could be seen. There was no relation between Client Satisfaction with Device measures and duration of insole use. A difference in sex was shown; women scored higher than men on Pain Severity. Conclusion: Insoles reduce pain and pain interference with daily activities for women with foot pain. Satisfaction with the insoles is not a predictor of actual insole use. The effect of insoles on activity performance needs further study. Clinical relevance: This study provides evidence for prescribing insoles to people with foot pain.

Clinical trials with sulfasalazine have used an array of measures of disease activity, such as the number of tender and swollen joints, Ritchie articular index (RAI) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). In randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, sulfasalazine was associated with statistically significant benefits for various measures of disease activity, according to results of individual trials and/or meta-analysis. Sulfasalazine was associated with broadly similar efficacy to that of various other DMARDs in several randomised, double-blind, comparative trials. Promising results have also been demonstrated with sulfasalazine in combination with other DMARDs (e.g. methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine) in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis and in those with more established disease. Sulfasalazine was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse effects being adverse gastrointestinal effects, headache, dizziness and rash; myelosuppression can also occur. Sulfasalazine has a relatively short lag time until its onset of action and is often considered to be among the more efficacious traditional DMARDs.

49,2019,19458163,"Objectives: For pharmacological reasons, the effect of the combination of MTX and SSZ may be different in RA patients who are naïve to these drugs compared to patients with an insufficient response to one of them. Therefore, we compared the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the combination of MTX and SSZ in naïve patients and in patients with an insufficient response to SSZ. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed to identify RCTs that compared the MTX-SSZ combination to either drug alone. The databases MEDLINE and the Cochrane Clinical Trials registry were searched from 1966 up to April 2007. The efficacy of the single therapeutic agents or their combination was assessed using the mean change in the disease activity score (DAS) and the ACR improvement criteria. Results: Four RCTs were identified to compare the efficacy of the combination MTX-SSZ to the efficacy of either drug alone. Two parallel trials were performed with patients naïve to both drugs and two add-on trials were performed in SSZ failures. In the trials with naïve patients, the mean DAS changes for the combination MTX and SSZ pointed to a sub-additive efficacy. In the trials with patients who previously failed to SSZ, the mean DAS changes for the combination MTX and SSZ indicated additive efficacy. Conclusions: In RA, addition of MTX to SSZ is a therapeutic option in SSZ failures, whereas combination of MTX and SSZ in DMARD-naïve patients has no added value.",Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,0.5725980997085571

Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.",Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,0.8867030143737793

Black morbidly obese women in the general population were less obese than black women obesity surgery patients, showed less emotional distress, and had fewer abnormal eating behaviours; age and socio-economic status were similar. A greater proportion of morbidly obese surgery patients were white women than would be expected either on the basis of the prevalence of morbid obesity in the general population or on census data. It was hypothesized that black women and white men avoid obesity surgery until they are physically debilitated by their overweight, while white women elect for obesity surgery when the emotional distress associated with obesity becomes debilitating.",Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,0.7144559025764465

50,2019,21985121,"In light of the failure of psychological approaches to obesity some clinicians and patients are turning to surgery. The present qualitative study aimed to explore patients' experiences of having obesity surgery and in-depth interviews were carried out with 15 men and women, who had had surgery in the past four years. The data were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The patients described their experiences in terms of four broad themes: personal weight histories; the decision-making process, which involved general motivations such as worries about health and specific triggers such as symptoms; the impact of surgery on eating behaviour and their relationship with food; the impact of weight loss on health status, self-esteem and relationships with others. The central theme of control permeated all areas of the interviews. The current clinical climate highlights the importance of self-control and patient choice as the path to patient empowerment. Obesity surgery illustrates that in contrast to this perspective, imposed control and limited choice can sometimes paradoxically result in a renewed sense of control.",Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,0.22877894341945648
50,2019,29863119,"In recent years, both the actual number of overweight/obese individuals and their proportion of the population have steadily been rising worldwide and obesity-related diseases have become major health concerns. In addition, as obesity is associated with an increased incidence of gastroenterological cancer, the number of obese patients has also been increasing in the field of gastroenterological surgery. While the influence of obesity on gastroenterological surgery has been widely studied, very few reports have focused on individual organs or surgical procedures, using a cross-sectional study design. In the present review, we aimed to summarize the impacts of obesity on surgeries for the esophagus, stomach, colorectum, liver and pancreas. In general, obesity prolongs operative time. As to short-term postoperative outcomes, obesity might be a risk for certain complications, depending on the procedure carried out. In contrast, it is possible that obesity doesn't adversely impact long-term surgical outcomes. The influences of obesity on surgery are made even more complex by various categories of operative outcomes, surgical procedures, and differences in obesity among races. Therefore, it is important to appropriately evaluate perioperative risk factors, including obesity.",Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,0.9155978560447693
50,2019,14574339,"Objective: The objective of this study is to present a review of the psychosocial outcome of bariatric surgery with special consideration of psychiatric comorbidity, psychopathology, psychosocial functioning, econometric data, and general quality of life (QoL). Purpose: A review of all (non-) controlled trials of the last two decades both with a retrospective and prospective design and a follow-up period of at least 1 y. Research methods and procedures: The relevant literature was identified by a search of computerized databases. All articles published in English and German since 1980 were reviewed. Based on the requirements of the evidenced-based guidelines of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, each study was rated by a level of evidence. Results: In all, 171 publications were reviewed. Using the above inclusion/exclusion criteria, 63 articles including two systematic reviews were identified. A total of 40 studies focused on psychosocial outcome after obesity surgery. Conclusion: Mental health and psychosocial status including social relations and employment opportunities improve for the majority of people after bariatric surgery thus leading to an improved QoL. Psychiatric comorbidity, predominantly affective disorders, and psychopathologic symptoms decrease postsurgically. A substantial percentage of bariatric surgery patients suffer from binge eating disorder or binge eating symptoms. The effect of bariatric surgery on the outcome of binge eating symptoms largely depends on the type of operation. With the exception of patients with a severe psychiatric comorbidity, the concern that obesity surgery will reinforce psychic symptoms and lead to a reduction in the QoL seems to be unfounded.",Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,0.9994332194328308

As was mentioned at the IFSO Symposium in Cancun, very little is known about obesity surgery in Russia. Methods: The authors undertook a literature search and interviewed surgeons who are known to perform bariatric procedures. Results: Jejunoileal bypass (JIB) was used in the 1970s but has been abandoned by most surgeons. Since 1977, 334 JIBs, of a total of 360 bariatric operations, have been performed at I Saint Petersburg Medical University. The remaining 26 operations included 14 gastric bandings, 6 horizontal and 4 vertical gastroplasties, and 2 gastric bypasses. Since 1984, 545 gastric banding procedures have been done at the Moscow Medical Academy, where the current approach is the lap-band type of gastric banding. The laparoscopic technique of adjustable gastric banding is beginning to be used. Vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) was begun in the early 1990s. At the Russian Research Center of Surgery in Moscow, 48 Mason VBGs have been done. The other group in Moscow reported 28 VBGs without the creation of a window and including covering the stoma by polypropylene mesh. There are only a few known cases of gastric bypass procedures. No data on biliopancreatic diversion were found. Conclusions: Obesity surgery is not being performed enough to satisfy the requirements of the Russian population.

50,2019,10731247,"BACKGROUND: Early attempts to characterize personality in obese persons led to the conclusion that the severely obese are not homogeneous on personality measures. More recently, cluster analysis procedures have been applied to identify meaningful personality subtypes in populations of persons with severe obesity; some progress has been made in this effort, but researchers have indicated the need for replication in other settings. METHODS: In the present study, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was administered to 163 female candidates for intestinal bypass surgery. RESULTS: Eight clusters were identified. Of the MMPI profiles, 71% were in one of four normal limit clusters. The remainder were distributed across four clusters, all beyond normal limits. CONCLUSIONS: Present and previous results appear to converge on representative personality subtypes in severe obesity. Identification of such meaningful subgroups of candidates for obesity surgery may enhance the prediction of surgery outcomes, and yield a better understanding of personality in severely obese women.",Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,0.9964578747749329

Methods: Data were analyzed from the Hospital Episode Statistics covering all 9 goverment office regions with a total population of 49.1 million. The data analyzed covered 9 years 1996/97 - 2004/05. Results: 1,465 records were identified with a primary diagnostic code for obesity and an operation code for obesity surgery. The surgery was performed mostly in women (male to female ratio of 1:5), who were predominantly mid-aged (average 40.4 years +/- SD 9.00), the majority of whom reside in local authority districts ranked within the lowest two deprivation quintiles. The availability of obesity surgery varied considerably across the 9 different regions of England, although the number of operations increased nationally over time.

50,2019,30940524,"Background &amp; aims: Bariatric surgery might reduce overall mortality from obesity. We investigated whether the survival times of patients who have had bariatric surgery are similar to those of the general population and are longer than of obese individuals who did not receive surgery. Methods: We performed a population-based cohort study of persons with a diagnosis of obesity listed in nationwide registries from Nordic countries from 1980 through 2012. Bariatric surgery was analyzed in relation to all-cause mortality and the obesity-related morbidities cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and suicide. Poisson models provided standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariable Cox regression provided hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality in participants who did and did not have surgery. Results: Among 505,258 participants, 49,977 had bariatric surgery. Overall all-cause SMR was increased after surgery (1.94; 95% CI, 1.83-2.05) and increased with longer follow-up, to 2.28 (95% CI, 2.07-2.51) at ≥15 years after surgery. SMRs were increased for cardiovascular disease (2.39; 95% CI, 2.17-2.63), diabetes (3.67; 95% CI, 2.85-4.72), and suicide (2.39; 95% CI, 1.96-2.92) but not for cancer (1.05; 95% CI, 0.95-1.17); SMRs increased with time. In obese participants who did not have surgery, all-cause SMR was 2.15 (95% CI, 2.11-2.20), which remained stable during follow-up. Compared with obese participants who did not have surgery, patients who had bariatric surgery had decreased overall mortality from all causes (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.60-0.66), cardiovascular disease (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.52-0.63), and diabetes (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.49) but increased mortality from suicide (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.32-2.14). Cancer mortality was decreased overall (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76-0.93) but increased at ≥15 years of follow-up (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.42). Conclusions: In a study of persons with a diagnosis of obesity listed in nationwide registries of Nordic countries, we found that obese patients who have bariatric surgery have longer survival times than obese individuals who did not have bariatric surgery, but their mortality is higher than that of the general population and increases with time. Obesity-related morbidities could account for these findings.",Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,0.9391060471534729

51,2019,9150835,"Dehumidifiers (DH) are potentially effective appliances as coadjuvant therapy in the treatment of bronchial asthma caused by sensitization to house dust mites. The aims of this study were to analyze DH tolerance in asthmatic patients, to assess the parasitological effects and to analyze the environmental effects produced by the use of these appliances in the bedrooms of asthmatic patients sensitized to house dust mites. 10 stable asthmatic patients sensitized to house dust mites were studied. DH appliances (CD-300) were installed in their bedrooms. Each patient was given symptom scoring tables and a portable peak expiratory flow (P.E.F.) during a period of 5 months, 1 month before installing the DH and 4 months afterwards. To study the parasitological efficacy of the DHs, we analyzed dust samples from the bedrooms and determined the Der p I, Der f I and Der II allergens by means of a modified ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies. Dust samples were collected before installing the DHs and after they had been working for 2 and 4 months. Dry temperature and relative humidity measurements at three time intervals (7-9, 15-17 and 22-24 h) were carried out. The 1st measurement was done prior to installation of the DHs in the patients' bedrooms and the 2nd and 3rd were achieved 2 and 4 months respectively after the installation. Statistical analysis was done by comparison of paired means. No significant differences were detected in the patients' symptoms nor in the P.E.F. measurements in the course of the study. Decreases in the house dust mite allergens were observed in 4 bedrooms. A significant decrease in relative humidity in the bedrooms of mite asthma patients after use of dehumidifier appliances was observed (p 0.01). Significant differences between the measurements of the bedrooms with and without DH were detected (p 0.01).

51,2019,23760885,"Background: Humidity control measures in the home environment of patients with asthma have been recommended, since a warm humid environment favours the growth of house dust mites. However, there is no consensus about the usefulness of these measures. Objectives: To study the effect of dehumidification of the home environment on asthma control. Search methods: The clinical trials registers of the Cochrane Collaboration and Cochrane Airways Group were searched. Searches were current as of March 2013. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials on the use of humidity control measures in the home environment of patients with asthma were evaluated for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted independently using a pre-designed data extraction form by two review authors. Main results: A second trial has been added for the 2013 update of this review. The original open-label trial compared an intervention consisting of mechanical ventilation heat recovery system with or without high efficiency vacuum cleaner fitted in 40 homes of patients with asthma who had positive tests for sensitivity to house dust mite. The new double-blind trial also compared a mechanical ventilation heat recovery system with a placebo machine in the homes of 120 adults with allergy to house dust mite. The new trial, which was at low risk of bias, showed no significant difference in morning peak flow (mean difference (MD) 13.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.66 to 29.84), which was the primary outcome of the trial. However, there was a statistically significant improvement in evening peak flow only (MD 24.56; 95% CI 8.97 to 40.15). There was no significant difference in quality of life, rescue medication, requirement for oral corticosteroids, visits to the GP, emergency department (ED) or hospitalisations for asthma. There was no significant difference in the house dust mite count and the antigen levels in the new trial, in contrast to the previous trial.

A self-report survey questionnaire elicited experiences of respiratory symptoms, disease history, and characteristics of residential environmental factors from schoolchildren. The proportion of schoolchildren having physician-diagnosed asthma was 9.8% and suspected asthma was 16.1%. The proportions of having respiratory symptoms in the past 12 months ranged from 9.8% for wheezing without a cold to 40.5% for exercise-induced cough. Higher proportions of boys had non-exercise-induced respiratory symptoms, physician-diagnosed asthma, and suspected asthma than girls (p 0.05). Exposure to odoriferous chemical vapor was significantly associated with all seven respiratory symptoms considered in the study (p 0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors including residential districts, gender, diagnosed allergy, and parental history of respiratory symptoms, odoriferous chemical vapors, gas leaks, dehumidifier use, presence of cockroaches at home, and leaky water/water puddle at home were significantly associated with the proportions of physician-diagnosed asthma or suspected asthma of the schoolchildren. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of physician-diagnosed asthma was 2.35 (95% confidential interval = 1.45-3.82) for odoriferous chemical vapor.

There have been many trials of interventions aimed at reducing mite populations in the home, but most have been uncontrolled, too small, or too short to determine with confidence any beneficial effects. Of those which succeeded, very few used methods which reduced mite populations on a permanent basis. House dust mites are sensitive to humidity. Their geographical distribution is closely correlated to the availability of moisture. Very little work has been done on the effects of reducing humidity in the home environment in the long term, with a view to controlling dust mite populations. Two different methods which might reduce humidities to levels which could successfully reduce dust mite numbers are dehumidifiers, and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR).

51,2019,16268830,"Meteorological factors such as relative humidity directly correlate with airborne fungal levels outdoors and indoors. While dehumidification alone is effective at reducing moisture necessary for mold growth, it is inadequate as a single intervention as it does not remove viable and non-viable fungal spores that are potentially allergenic. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate whether dehumidification in combination with high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filtration is effective at reducing airborne mold spore levels in day care centers. Two day care centers within a 2-mile radius of each other were selected. Day care center A was 2 years old with eight rooms while day care center B was 15 years old with six rooms. A high efficiency Santa Fe dehumidification unit equipped with a HEPA filter was installed in half the rooms (intervention) of each day care facility. Electronic HOBO data loggers continuously measured outdoor and indoor room dew point and temperature every 2 h throughout the study. Dew point and airborne fungal spore measurements from selected rooms with controlled air conditions were analyzed by comparing baseline measurements to those obtained at subsequent time periods over 1 year. Regression models accounted for correlations between measurements in the same room over time. Intervention resulted in a lowered average dew point from baseline by 8.8 degrees C compared with a decrease of 7.1 degrees C in non-intervention rooms across all time periods in both facilities (P 0.001). Fungal analyses demonstrated lower baseline (P=0.06) and follow-up means in intervention rooms (P 0.05), however the change from baseline to end of follow-up differed between intervention and non-intervention rooms in the two facilities. Log transformation was applied to approximate normality of fungal measurements. Dehumidification with HEPA filtration was effective at controlling indoor dew point in both facilities and at reducing airborne culturable fungal spore levels in one of the two facilities. These preliminary results provide a scientific rationale for using this intervention in future studies designed to investigate the impact of indoor mold exposure on health outcomes. Practical implications: Poor indoor air quality is a recognized cause or contributing factor to health effects. Dampness and humidity have been linked to upper and lower respiratory symptoms in children and adults. This study indicates that reducing indoor relative humidity and airborne mold spore levels using high-efficiency dehumidification units equipped with HEPA filtration is feasible even in work facilities such as day care centers where traffic in and out of the building is difficult to regulate.

They are generally designed to protect against re-rupture by preventing undesired dorsiflexion and to prevent elongation by achieving plantarflexion in the ankle. There is limited knowledge of the biomechanical effects of different AFO designs and ankle angles on the tendon and lower leg muscles. Hypothesis: The hypothesis was that non-uniform displacement in the Achilles tendon, lower leg muscle activity, and plantar pressure distribution would be affected differently in different designs of AFO and by varying the degree of dorsiflexion limitation. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Ultrasound of the Achilles tendon, EMG of the lower leg muscles and plantar pressure distribution were recorded in 16 healthy subjects during walking on a treadmill unbraced and wearing three designs of AFO. Ultrasound speckle tracking was used to estimate motion within the tendon. The tested AFO designs were a rigid AFO and a dorsal brace used together with wedges and an AFO with an adjustable ankle angle restricting dorsiflexion to various degrees. Results: There were no significant differences in non-uniform tendon displacement or muscle activity between the different designs of AFO. For the rigid AFO and the adjustable AFO there was a significant reduction in non-uniform displacement within the tendon and soleus muscle activity as restriction in dorsiflexion increased. Conclusion: The degree of dorsiflexion allowed within an AFO had greater effects on Achilles tendon displacement patterns and muscle activity in the calf than differences in AFO design. AFO settings that allowed ankle dorsiflexion to neutral resulted in displacement patterns in the Achilles tendon and muscle activity in the lower leg which were close to those observed during unbraced walking.",Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,ankle brace achilles tendonitis,0.0,Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,0.4326736629009247
101,2021,19340434,"Introduction: There is a trend towards surgical treatment of acute ruptured Achilles tendon. While classical open surgical procedures have been shown to restore good functional capacity, they are potentially associated with significant complications like wound infection and paresthesia. Modern mini-invasive surgical techniques significantly reduce these complications and are also associated with good functional results so that they can be considered as the surgical treatment of choice. Nevertheless, there is still a need for conservative alternative and recent studies report good results with conservative treatment in rigid casts or braces. Patients/method: We report the use of a dynamic ankle brace in the conservative treatment of Achilles tendon rupture in a prospective non-randomised study of 57 consecutive patients. Patients were evaluated at an average follow-up time of 5 years using the modified Leppilahti Ankle Score, and the first 30 patients additionally underwent a clinical examination and muscular testing with a Cybex isokinetic dynamometer at 6 and 12 months. Results: We found good and excellent results in most cases. We observed five complete re-ruptures, almost exclusively in case of poor patient's compliance, two partial re-ruptures and one deep venous thrombosis complicated by pulmonary embolism. Conclusion: Although prospective comparison with other modern treatment options is still required, the functional outcome after early ankle mobilisation in a dynamic cast is good enough to ethically propose this method as an alternative to surgical treatment.",Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,ankle brace achilles tendonitis,0.0,Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,0.9933049082756042
101,2021,26261783,"Background: we investigated how ruptured Achilles tendons are loaded in a brace. There is an ongoing discussion whether patients should be recommended to bear weight on the injured limb. However, little is known about the effects of bracing on tensional loading of the healing Achilles tendon: it is uncertain if load-bearing actually stresses the Achilles tendon inside a brace. Methods: we measured plantar flexion moment inside the brace, in order to estimate tensional loading of the tendon, by use of an insole with pressure transducers. Results: after wearing the brace for 1 hour, young healthy individuals reduced their maximum flexion moment during gait by half. Patients with Achilles tendon rupture showed no measurable flexion moment during gait with the brace, 4 or 7 weeks after injury. Only when specifically instructed, they could produce a considerable plantar flexion moment. We noted that gait speed with the brace at 4 weeks correlated with a heel-raise functional test at 1 year: the higher the spontaneous gait speed, the less the functional difference between the injured and the uninjured leg (r(2)=0.68; p=0.002). Conclusion: the correlation with gait speed suggests that the patients' general physical aptness has an impact on the end result.",Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,ankle brace achilles tendonitis,0.0,Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,0.6589468121528625
101,2021,27440563,"Background: An infected Achilles tendon after tendon repair is particularly difficult to treat because of the poor vascularity of the tendon as well as the thin surrounding soft tissue. For treatment of an infected Achilles tendon following tendon repair, we first focused on complete debridement and then promoted fibrous scar healing of the Achilles tendon using functional treatment. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all of the medical records of 15 tertiary referral patients with postoperative infection of the Achilles tendon occurring between 2007 and 2012. The mean follow-up time was 33 months (range, 22 to 97 months). The infected tissue and the necrotic tendon were debrided, and the ankle was placed in a short leg splint for 2 weeks. The splint was then replaced with an ankle brace for the next 4 weeks. Partial weight-bearing was allowed immediately, and full weight-bearing was allowed at 2 weeks postoperatively. We assessed and recorded the physical parameters such as the range of motion, calf circumference, ability to perform a single-limb heel rise, patient satisfaction, and Arner-Lindholm scale. Laboratory tests, postoperative ultrasonography, and isokinetic plantar flexion power tests were also performed. Results: At a mean time of 17 days (range, 8 to 30 days) after debridement, infection signs such as discharge from the wound, redness, and local warmth resolved. The wound had healed and the stitches were removed at a mean of 17 days following the wound repair. At the time of the latest follow-up, there were no signs of active infection. Achilles tendon continuity recovered in all patients by fibrous scar healing. Compared with the contralateral side, there was no difference in the ankle range of motion in 8 patients. According to the Arner-Lindholm scale, 9 of the 15 results were excellent and 6 were good. Ten patients were able to perform a single-limb heel rise. Eleven of 15 patients returned to their pre-injury recreational activities. Diffuse homogeneous echotexture of the Achilles tendon with continuity was observed on the ultrasonographic examination. Conclusions: In this retrospective series, radical debridement, combined with antibiotic therapy and functional rehabilitation, was successful in eradicating infection and maintaining function in patients with postoperative infection following Achilles tendon repair.

101,2021,27746496,"Background: Transfer of a flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon can not only reconstruct the Achilles tendon but also provide ischemic tendinous tissues with a rich blood supply to enhance wound healing. This retrospective study aims to investigate clinical outcomes in patients who underwent repair of Kuwada grade IV chronic Achilles tendon rupture with long hallucis longus tendons harvested using a minimally invasive technique. Materials and methods: 35 patients who were treated for Kuwada grade IV Achilles tendon injuries from July 2006 to June 2011 were included in this retrospective study. The age ranged between 23 and 71 years. The duration from primary injury to surgery ranged from 29 days to 34 months (mean value, 137.6 days). All 35 patients had difficulties in lifting their calves. Thirty two were followed up for a mean 32.2 months (range 18-72 months), whereas three were lost to followup. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the tendon rupture gap ranged from 6.0 to 9.2 cm. During surgery, a 2.0 cm minor incision was made vertically in the medial plantar side of the midfoot, and a 1.5 cm minor transverse incision was made in the plantar side of the interphalangeal articulation of the great toe to harvest the FHL tendon, and the tendon was fixed to the calcaneus with suture anchors. Postoperative appearance and function were evaluated by physiotherapists based American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society-ankle and hindfoot score (AOFAS-AH), and Leppilahti Achilles tendon ratings. Results: Results were assessed in 32 patients. Except for one patient who suffered complications because of wound disruption 10 days after the operation, all other patients had primary wound healing, with 28 of 32 able to go up on their toes at last followup. The AOFAS-AH score was increased from preoperative (51.92 ± 7.08) points to (92.56 ± 6.71) points; Leppilahti Achilles tendon score was increased from preoperative (72.56 ± 7.43) to (92.58 ± 5.1). There were statistically significant differences. The result of the total excellent and good rate was 93.8% (30/32).

101,2021,27000133,"Background When Achilles tendon ruptures become chronic, a defect often forms at the rupture site. There is scant literature regarding the treatment of chronic Achilles ruptures with defects of 6 cm or larger. We examined outcomes from combining a turndown of the proximal, central Achilles with a flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon transfer to treat this condition. Materials Between September 2002 and December 2013, 32 patients presented with a chronic Achilles rupture and a defect of 6 cm or more. Twenty patients were male and 12 were female. Patient age was between 20 and 74 years, with a mean of 53.3 years. Eighteen and 14 patients had their right and left Achilles tendon affected, respectively. The number of days between injury and surgery ranged from 30 to 315 days, with a mean of 102 days. Reconstruction of the Achilles involved a turndown of the proximal, central tendon and FHL augmentation. Final patient follow-up ranged from 18 to 150 months, with a mean of 62.3 months. Results: At surgery, the gap between the ruptured ends of the Achilles ranged from 6 to 12 cm, with a mean gap of 7.5 cm. Full healing was achieved in all 32 patients (100%) by 5 months postoperatively. Mean Foot and Ankle Ability Measures scores increased from 36.3% to 90.2% between initial and latest follow-up (P .05). Mean visual analogue scales of pain decreased from 6.6 to 1.8 of 10 between first and last encounter (P .05). Postoperative complications occurred in 5 patients (15.6%), including 3 (9.4%) superficial wound problems, 1 (3.1%) deep wound infection, and 1 (3.1%) deep vein thrombosis. Discussion Outcomes from treating chronic Achilles ruptures with large defects are scant within the orthopaedic literature. Our method of Achilles reconstruction results in a high rate of improved function and pain relief.

101,2021,19825776,"Conservative management of acute Achilles tendon ruptures in a plantarflexed short leg cast or functional brace is a viable alternative to surgery. The ideal plantarflexion angle to allow the free ends of the tendon to oppose one another has not been clearly defined. The purpose of this cadaveric study was to define a plantarflexion angle where the free Achilles tendon ends reliably oppose one another. Ten cadaveric legs amputated at the distal femur were obtained. A laceration of the Achilles tendon was made 4 cm above the calcaneal insertion. A joint-spanning external fixator was placed across the knee. With differing degrees of knee flexion (0, 45, and 90 degrees), the diastasis between the free ends of the Achilles tendon was measured as the ankle was moved from 20 degrees of dorsiflexion to 30 degrees of plantarflexion (-20, -10, neutral, 10, 20, and 30 degrees). Regardless of knee flexion angle, the ankle plantarflexion angle where the free ends of the Achilles tendon opposed one another was 28.0 (95% confidence interval: 25.0-33.6) degrees.

This discomfort occurs when there is a difference between the thermal informations coming from the body and the central thermoregulator set point. It triggers crying when the child has no way to escape. Considering the little effectiveness (0.3 degree C on average) of the association bath cooling and antipyretic treatment versus antipyretic treatment, and the preservation of the child comfort, bathing in tepid water is not useful in current care of children fever.",Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,tepid sponge bath reduce fever children,0.0,Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,0.10888119041919708

Seventy-five children aged between 6 and 53 months who attended the casualty department of the Children's Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, with fever (rectal temperature &gt; or = 38.5 degrees C) of presumed viral origin were randomized to received either tepid sponging and oral paracetamol (sponged group) or paracetamol alone (control group). Rectal temperature and the occurrence of crying, irritability, and shivering were recorded over the following 2 hours. A greater and more rapid fall in mean rectal temperature occurred in the sponged group than in the control group. Temperature fell below 38.5 degrees C sooner in children in the sponged group than in control children (P 0.001).

We did not find any studies reporting on the effectiveness of tepid sponging in addition to dipyrone. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of tepid sponging plus dipyrone with dipyrone alone for reducing fever. Design and setting: A randomized clinical trial was undertaken at Instituto Materno-Infantil Professor Fernando Figueira, Recife, Pernambuco. Methods: Children from six months to five years old with axillary temperature greater than 38 masculineC in the emergency ward between January and July 2006 were eligible. One hundred and twenty children were randomly assigned to receive oral dipyrone (20 mg/kg) or oral dipyrone and tepid sponging for 15 minutes. The primary outcome was mean temperature reduction after 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Secondary outcomes were crying and irritability. Results: 106 children finished the study. After the first 15 minutes, the fall in axillary temperature was significantly greater in the sponged group than in the control group (p 0.001). From 30 to 120 minutes, better fever control was observed in the control group. Crying and irritability were observed respectively in 52% and 36% of the sponged children and in none and only two of the controls. Conclusions: Tepid sponging plus dipyrone cooled faster during the first 15 minutes, but dipyrone alone presented better fever control over the two-hour period.

102,2021,34138848,"Introduction: Divergent attitudes towards fever have led to a high level of inconsistency in approaches to its management. In an attempt to overcome this, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the symptomatic management of fever in children have been produced by several healthcare organizations. To date, a comprehensive assessment of the evidence level of the recommendations made in these CPGs has not been carried out. Methods: Searches were conducted on Pubmed, google scholar, pediatric society websites and guideline databases to locate CPGs from each country (with date coverage from January 1995 to September 2020). Rather than assessing overall guideline quality, the level of evidence for each recommendation was evaluated according to criteria of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM). A GRADE assessment was undertaken to assess the body of evidence related to a single question: the threshold for initiating antipyresis. Methods and results are reported according to the PRISMA statement. Results: 74 guidelines were retrieved. Recommendations for antipyretic threshold, type and dose; ambient temperature; dress/covering; activity; fluids; nutrition; proctoclysis; external applications; complementary/herbal recommendations; media; and age-related treatment differences all varied widely. OCEBM evidence levels for most recommendations were low (Level 3-4) or indeterminable. The GRADE assessment revealed a very low level of evidence for a threshold for antipyresis. Conclusion: There is no recommendation on which all guidelines agree, and many are inconsistent with the evidence-this is true even for recent guidelines. The threshold question is of fundamental importance and has not yet been answered. Guidelines for the most frequent intervention (antipyresis) remain problematic.",Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,tepid sponge bath reduce fever children,0.0,Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,0.4165765047073364

Currently, there is no effective treatment of these diseases and, therefore, it seems justified to develop the principles of prevention, taking into account the elimination of risk factors. Among them folic acid deficiency may play an important role. The aim of the study: To evaluate possible relationship of folate deficiency with the development of selected dementia diseases: vascular dementia (VaD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), mixed dementia (MD). Material and methods: The study involved 166 people, including 47 people with the diagnosis of AD, 41 with VaD and 36 with MD. The control group consisted of 42 persons without cognitive impairment. All patients underwent a general physical, neurological, psychiatric and extensive neuropsychological examination, as well as routine blood and biochemical screening tests and neuroimaging. The level of serum folate (Fol) was measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. To assess the correlation of Fol level with the cognitive impairment neuropsychometric scales: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) were used. Results: In patients with dementia, compared with the control group, there were significantly lower levels of folic acid (p = 0.04). There was no difference in the concentration of Fol in groups of patients (p = 0.0889). In people without cognitive impairment (CDR 0) levels of folic acid were significantly higher compared to the group with moderate dementia (CDR 2, p = 0.0475). Conclusions: The results may suggest that folic acid deficiency is one of the possible causes of dementia, but does not determine its type.

We aimed to characterize elderly, community-dwelling, newly admitted patients to a large urban psychiatric hospital who are suffering from untreated folic acid deficiency in comparison with elderly inpatients who do not suffer from this deficiency. During a 2-year period, all subjects aged 65 years or older admitted to the large psychiatric center were tested for levels of serum folic acid levels. Subjects suffering from folic acid deficiency were compared (unpaired t-test) with matched patients with normal serum levels. Of the 293 newly admitted elderly patients 45 (15.7%) suffered from folic acid deficiency. Mean age for the folic acid deficient group was 77.3+/-8.1 years, 38% were diagnosed as suffering from dementia, 22% were depressed and 51% were living alone. In the comparison group mean age was 77.3+/-6.3 years, 33% were diagnosed as suffering from dementia, 24% were suffering from depression and 57% were living alone.

103,2021,16774490,"Folic acid supplementation has drawn much attention in recent years for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline. In this review, the authors describe how current evidence does not support the use of folic acid supplements to protect against cognitive decline. Although a few studies suggest that folic acid supplementation may provide neuroprotection among persons who are folate deficient, there is also data to indicate that supplementation in persons without folate deficiency may pose a risk to neurological function. Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in old age and may not be easy to recognise. Folic acid supplementation may mask the anaemia associated with vitamin B12 deficiency and, therefore, may delay treatment while allowing progression of neurological symptoms. Whether or not folic acid supplementation exacerbates neurological symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency is not clear.

103,2021,34791275,"Background: As the life expectancy of elderly people has drastically increased, the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in this population has proportionally grown. Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) refers to all forms of cognitive disorder associated with cerebrovascular disease. Homocysteine has recently been recognized as a contributor to the pathomechanisms involved in cognitive impairment. B vitamins, such as folic acid, are known to be effective in lowering homocysteine levels. Aim of the study: To evaluate the efficacy of folic acid in patients with VCI. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of research on folic acid treatments for VCI. Only randomized controlled trials studies that compared the efficacy of folic acid to placebo or other interventions were considered, irrespective of publication status, year of publication, and languages. Two independent reviewers searched the Medline via Ovid, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central) journal databases up to July 2021 and independently appraised the included studies. We used mean difference outcome with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to calculate the change of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), cognitive function domain, and concentration of homocysteine. Results: We found three studies comparing folic acid with placebo and one study comparing folic acid with other interventions. There is only slight evidence that the MMSE score in patients who received Folic Acid increased 0.3 point higher compared to the placebo group after 24 months (95% CI:-0.12-0.37; p=0.31). There is very strong evidence that the concentration of Homocysteine in the Folic Acid group became 6.16 μmol/L lower compared to the placebo group after 6 months (95% CI:2.32-8.21 lower; p 0.001). Conclusions: Our review shows the effectiveness of folic acid in lowering plasma homocysteine concentration after 6 months period compared to placebo.

103,2021,18054217,"Low blood folate and raised homocysteine concentrations are associated with poor cognitive function. Folic acid supplementation improves cognitive function. Folic acid enhances the plasma concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid (AA) are of benefit in dementia and Alzheimer's disease by up-regulating gene expression concerned with neurogenesis, neurotransmission and connectivity, improving endothelial nitric oxide (eNO) generation, enhancing brain acetylcholine levels, and suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. EPA, DHA, and AA also form precursors to anti-inflammatory compounds such as lipoxins, resolvins, and neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) that protect neurons from the cytotoxic action of various noxious stimuli. Furthermore, various neurotrophins and statins enhance the formation of NPD1 and thus, protect neurons from oxidative stress and prevent neuronal apoptosis Folic acid improves eNO generation, enhances plasma levels of EPA/DHA and thus, could augment the formation of NPD1.

103,2021,14584018,"Background: Folates are vitamins essential to the development of the central nervous system. Insufficient folate activity at the time of conception and early pregnancy can result in congenital neural tube defects. In adult life folate deficiency has been known for decades to produce a characteristic form of anaemia (""megaloblastic""). More recently degrees of folate inadequacy, not severe enough to produce anaemia, have been found to be associated with high blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine. Such degrees of folate inadequacy can arise because of insufficient folates in the diet or because of inefficient absorption or metabolic utilisation of folates due to genetic variations. Conventional criteria for diagnosing folate deficiency may be inadequate for identifying people capable of benefiting from dietary supplementation. High blood levels of homocysteine have been linked with the risk of arterial disease, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. There is therefore interest in whether dietary supplements of folic acid (an artificial chemical analogue of naturally occurring folates) can improve cognitive function of people at risk of cognitive decline associated with ageing or dementia, whether by affecting homocysteine metabolism or through other mechanisms. There is a risk that if folic acid is given to people who have undiagnosed deficiency of vitamin B12 it may lead to neurological damage. Vitamin B12 deficiency produces both an anaemia identical to that of folate deficiency but also causes irreversible damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems. Folic acid will correct the anaemia of vitamin B12 deficiency and so delay diagnosis but will not prevent progression to neurological damage. For this reason trials of folic acid supplements may involve simultaneous administration of vitamin B12. Apparent benefit from folic acid given in the combination would therefore need to be ""corrected"" for any effect of vitamin B12 alone. A separate Cochrane review of vitamin B12 and cognitive function is being prepared. Objectives: To examine the effects of folic acid supplementation, with or without vitamin B12, on elderly healthy and demented people, in preventing cognitive impairment or retarding its progress. Search strategy: Trials were identified from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Specialized Register Group on 9 April 2003 using the terms: folic acid, folate, vitamin B9, leucovorin, methyltetrahydrofolate, vitamin B12, cobalamin, cyanocobalamin, dementia, cognitive function, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, mixed dementia and controlled trials. MEDLINE and EMBASE (both all years) were searched for additional trials on healthy people. Selection criteria: All double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials, in which supplements of folic acid with or without vitamin B12 were compared with placebo for elderly healthy people or people with any type of dementia or cognitive impairment. Data collection and analysis: The reviewers independently applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality. One reviewer extracted and analysed the data. In comparing intervention with placebo, weighted mean differences, and standardized mean difference or odds ratios were estimated. Main results: Four randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. One trial (Bryan 2002) enrolled healthy women, and three (Fioravanti 1997; Sommer 1998; VITAL 2003) recruited people with mild to moderate cognitive impairment or dementia with or without diagnosed folate deficiency. Fioravanti 1997 enrolled people with mild to moderate cognitive impairment or dementia as judged by scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Global Deterioration Scale and with serum folate level 3ng/l. One trial (VITAL 2003) studied the effects of a combination of vitamin B12 and folic acid on patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or mixed dementia. The analysis from the included trials found no benefit from folic acid with or without vitamin B12 in comparison with placebo on any measures of cognition and mood for healthy or cognitively impaired or demented people: Folic acid effect and healthy participants: there was no benefit from of oral 750 mcg folic acid per day for five weeks compared with placebo on measures of cognition and mood of 19 healthy women aged 65 to 92. Folic acid effect and people with mild to moderate cognitive decline or dementia: there were no statistically significant results in favour of folic acid with or without vitamin B12 on any measures of cognitive function. Scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) revealed no statistically significant benefit from 2 mg per day folic acid plus 1mg vitamin B12 for 12 weeks when compared with placebo (WMD 0.39, 95% CI -0.43 to 1.21, P=0.35). Cognitive scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Scale (ADAS-Cog) showed no statistically significant benefit from 2 mg /day folic acid plus 1 mg /day vitamin B12 for 12 weeks compared with placebo (WMD 0.41, 95% -1.25 to 2.07, P=4.63). The Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADL) revealed no benefit from 2mg per day of folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12 for 12 weeks in comparison with placebo (WMD -0.57, 95%CI -1.95 to 0.81, P=0.42). None of the sub tests of the Randt Memory Test (RMT) showed statistically significant benefit from 15 mg of folic acid orally per day for 9 weeks when compared with placebo. One trial (Sommer 1998) reported a significant decline compared with placebo in two cognitive function tasks in demented patients who had received high doses of folic acid (10 mg /day) for unspecified periods. One trial (VITAL 2003) showed that 2 mg folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12 daily for 12 weeks significantly lowered serum homocysteine concentrations (P 0.0001). Reviewer's conclusions: There was no beneficial effect of 750 mcg of folic acid per day on measures of cognition or mood in older healthy women. In patients with mild to moderate cognitive decline and different forms of dementia there was no benefit from folic acid on measures of cognition or mood. Folic acid plus vitamin B12 was effective in reducing the serum homocysteine concentrations. Folic acid was well tolerated and no adverse effects were reported.

103,2021,16332669,"Background: Low folate status is associated with poor cognitive function and dementia in the elderly. Since 1998, grain products in the United States have been fortified with folic acid, which has reduced the prevalence of folate deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia. Objective: We investigated whether folate status is associated with cognitive function and dementia in a cohort of elderly Latinos (aged &gt;or= 60 y; n = 1789) exposed to folic acid fortification. Design: Global cognitive function was assessed by the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) and specific cognitive functions by cross-culturally validated neuropsychological tests. Dementia was diagnosed according to the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition revised, and California Alzheimer Disease Diagnostic and Treatment criteria. Red blood cell (RBC) folate was measured by automated chemiluminescence and total plasma homocysteine by HPLC. Results: The prevalence of folate deficiency (RBC folate or= 160 ng/mL) was 1%. After control for confounding by homocysteine, vitamin B-12, creatinine, demographic variables, and depressive symptom score, RBC folate was directly associated with 3MSE (P = 0.005) and delayed recall (P = 0.007) scores. In addition, adjusted odds ratios for low 3MSE score ( or=78) and dementia diagnosis per unit increase in RBC folate were significantly below unity (P or= 0.008), which indicated that the relative risks of cognitive impairment and dementia decreased with increasing RBC folate concentration. In contrast, adjusted odds ratios for low 3MSE score and dementia diagnosis per unit increase in homocysteine were not significant. Conclusion: RBC folate is directly associated with cognitive function scores and is inversely associated with dementia in elderly Latinos despite folic acid fortification.",Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,folic acid dementia,0.0,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,0.8447175621986389

However, the patient and therapist perspective on how to improve the experience of wearing compression garments remains unexplored. Objective: To gain an understanding of the patient and therapist perspective of potential improvements to the provision of compression garments after burns. Method: A qualitative research design with an interpretive description approach was utilised in this study. Data was collected from patients through semi-structured interviews and a focus group and therapists by a focus group. Thematic analysis was completed to reveal the key themes across the data. Results: Two main themes were identified: ""what patients want"" and ""access to professional development"". The first theme ""what patients want"" described three suggested improvements including education, peer support, and increased participation in garment prescription.

106,2021,9394983,"The aim of this 2-year study was to test the hypothesis that folic acid, vitamin B12 and sun exposure could be helpful in treating vitiligo. One hundred patients with vitiligo were treated with oral folic acid and vitamin B12 after being informed that sun exposure might enhance repigmentation. They were requested to keep a record of sun exposure in summer and UVB irradiation in winter. The minimal treatment time suggested was 3-6 months but should be longer if improvement was achieved. Clear repigmentation occurred in 52 patients, including 37 who exposed their skin to summer sun and 6 who used UVB lamps in winter. Repigmentation was most evident on sun-exposed areas, where 38% of the patients had previously noted repigmentation during summer months. Total repigmentation was seen in 6 patients. The spread of vitiligo stopped in 64% of the patients after treatment. Folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation combined with sun exposure can induce repigmentation better than either the vitamins or sun exposure alone. Treatment should continue as long as the white areas continue to repigment.

Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency in some vitiligo patients has prompted researchers to investigate the efficacy of these vitamins in the treatment of vitiligo. In the present controlled study we investigated the value of narrow band UVB phototherapy in the treatment of vitiligo and the possible additive effect of vitamin B12 and folic acid. Twenty-seven patients with long-term stable vitiligo were included and randomized in a ""UVB only"" (UVB) or ""UVB combined with vitamin B12 and folic acid"" (UVB+) group. Patients were irradiated thrice weekly for one year, whilst repigmentation was carefully monitored. In 92% (25/27) of the patients up to 100% repigmentation was seen. Repigmentation was notable in lesions on the face, neck and throat, lower arm, chest, back and lower legs, whilst repigmentation on the hands, wrists, feet and ankles proved to be minimal. Maximum repigmentation rates did not differ significantly between the UVB group and the UVB+ group.

Results: While there are multiple publications on the use of nutritional supplements for amelioration of skin diseases, most of them are based on either associations or in vitro studies, but very few transcend the rigors of a clinical trial or the holey grail of a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. There seem to be some evidence in acne, psoriasis, telogen effluvium, urticaria &amp; vitiligo. Coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis have a strong link with diet. Rosacea has a strong link with certain foods, but the other disorders like melasma, aphthous stomatitis do not have any scientifically validated association with diet.

Relative deficiency of folic acid may occur in conditions such as pregnancy and hyperproliferative or chronic inflammatory disorders. Folic acid supplementation has been proven to be beneficial in the prevention of neural tube defects and in limiting methotrexate side effects, and may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Folate is a critical vitamin in determining plasma homocysteine levels, which in turn is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The results of large clinical trials with dietary supplementation of folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 have shown that this homocysteine-lowering therapy is effective in the secondary prevention of non-fatal strokes, but had no effect in the prevention of fatal cardiovascular diseases. Hyperhomocysteinemia has also been reported in age-related neurological conditions with cognitive impairment (e.g. dementia), and psychiatric disorders such as depression. Elevated homocysteine levels are frequent in patients with chronic immune-mediated disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, which have in common a tendency to an accelerated atherosclerosis leading to increased deaths from cardiovascular events.

Orally administered vitamins, acting as anti-oxidants and in combination with ultraviolet light have also demonstrated skin re-pigmentation. In our pilot study of seven patients, we injected skin affected with vitiligo intra-dermally with a complex of vitamins and minerals and assessed the outcome. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate a novel treatment modality for vitiligo. Methods: We present a pilot study of seven patients; each having been diagnosed with generalized progressive vitiligo. In all cases, multiple therapies had been previously attempted. All patients were subjected to intradermal injections of biorevitalizant NCTF 135 (3 mls) in the hypo-pigmented areas of skin, once a week for 5 weeks. A 30Gx13 mm needle was used for the 0.025 mls intradermal injections to create micro-papules with a 1 cm distance between the injection sites. The results were assessed at 2 weeks and 5 weeks and were considered successful if partial or complete repigmentation was achieved. Results: Partial or complete skin re-pigmentation post-treatment was observed in vitiligo macules of all patients (100%). No significant side effects, or exacerbation of vitiligo were observed during or after treatment with NCTF 135 in the following 6 months (five patients) and 12 months (two patients). Discussion: Increasing the armamentarium of new treatments of vitiligo is important. Previous studies showed the effectiveness of oral and intramuscularly injected multivitamins in the treatment of vitiligo, explaining the results by the antioxidative qualities of the above. Our study demonstrated that intradermal mesotherapy injections of NCTF135, rich with vitamins and other antioxidants are well tolerated and effective in achieving significant re-pigmentation of de-pigmented skin in all patients studied, including five who had been resistant to previous standard therapies.",Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo?,vitamin b12 sun exposure vitiligo,1.0,Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo?,0.8631160855293274

Narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) therapy, which was first used in vitiligo in 1997 by Westerhof and Nieuweboer-Krobotova, has emerged as one of the safest and most effective therapy for this dermatosis. The light source used for NB-UVB phototherapy is the TL-01 lamp, and the most common model of the NB-UVB phototherapy device is the upright in-office booth or chamber which has 24-48 such lamps. In recent years, there have been several advances in the understanding of the mechanism of action of NB-UVB and the use of combination treatments, many of which increase the efficacy of NB-UVB. In 2017, the Vitiligo Working Group made vital recommendations on the dosage, frequency, and safety of NB-UVB in vitiligo. Furthermore, home phototherapy devices are gaining popularity as they lead to an improved patient compliance.

107,2021,19643002,"Background: There is a substantial body of evidence on the efficacy of yoga in the management of bronchial asthma. Many studies have reported, as the effects of yoga on bronchial asthma, significant improvements in pulmonary functions, quality of life and reduction in airway hyper-reactivity, frequency of attacks and medication use. In addition, a few studies have attempted to understand the effects of yoga on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) or exercise tolerance capacity. However, none of these studies has investigated any immunological mechanisms by which yoga improves these variables in bronchial asthma. Methods: The present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted on 57 adult subjects with mild or moderate bronchial asthma who were allocated randomly to either the yoga (intervention) group (n = 29) or the wait-listed control group (n = 28). The control group received only conventional care and the yoga group received an intervention based on yoga, in addition to the conventional care. The intervention consisted of 2-wk supervised training in lifestyle modification and stress management based on yoga followed by closely monitored continuation of the practices at home for 6-wk. The outcome measures were assessed in both the groups at 0 wk (baseline), 2, 4 and 8 wk by using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) repeated measures followed by post-hoc analysis. Results: In the yoga group, there was a steady and progressive improvement in pulmonary function, the change being statistically significant in case of the first second of forced expiratory volume (FEV1) at 8 wk, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at 2, 4 and 8 wk as compared to the corresponding baseline values. There was a significant reduction in EIB in the yoga group. However, there was no corresponding reduction in the urinary prostaglandin D2 metabolite (11beta prostaglandin F2alpha) levels in response to the exercise challenge. There was also no significant change in serum eosinophilic cationic protein levels during the 8-wk study period in either group. There was a significant improvement in Asthma Quality of Life (AQOL) scores in both groups over the 8-wk study period. But the improvement was achieved earlier and was more complete in the yoga group. The number-needed-to-treat worked out to be 1.82 for the total AQOL score. An improvement in total AQOL score was greater than the minimal important difference and the same outcome was achieved for the sub-domains of the AQOL. The frequency of rescue medication use showed a significant decrease over the study period in both the groups. However, the decrease was achieved relatively earlier and was more marked in the yoga group than in the control group. Conclusion: The present RCT has demonstrated that adding the mind-body approach of yoga to the predominantly physical approach of conventional care results in measurable improvement in subjective as well as objective outcomes in bronchial asthma. The trial supports the efficacy of yoga in the management of bronchial asthma. However, the preliminary efforts made towards working out the mechanism of action of the intervention have not thrown much light on how yoga works in bronchial asthma.

108,2021,15823688,"Anorexia is a common symptom accompanying infections, but the teleology of the phenomenon remains unexplained. We hypothesize that anorexia may represent a prehistoric behavioral adaptation to fight infection by maintaining T helper (Th)2 bias, which is particularly vital in fighting bacterial pathogens. Specifically, we propose that anorexia may avert the reduction of Th2/Th1 ratio by preventing feeding-induced neurohormonal and vagal output from the gut. Emerging evidence suggests that the vagal and neurohormonal output of the gut during feeding promotes Th1 function, which is desirable in fighting viral infections. Since fever may be an adaptation to fight bacteria and ""colds"" are generally viral in origin, the adage ""starve a fever and feed a cold"" may reflect a sensible behavioral strategy to tilt autonomic and Th balance in directions that are optimal for fighting the particular type of infection. The ability to modulate T helper balance through the neurohormonal and autonomic axis by adjusting food intake may be the mechanism behind other unexplained clinical observations such as the improved outcomes of ICU patients after enteric versus parenteric feedings. Compared to the prehistoric period when bacterial infection was commonplace, the anorexic response may be less adaptive today when viruses and cancers have become common triggers of anorexia. By promoting host anorexia, cachexia, and insomnia, cancers and viruses can deter behaviors such as digestion and sleep that would raise vagal and Th1 activity against tumors and viruses. Hydration and sleep, unexplained but widely accepted recommendations for flu patients, may also work by promoting vagal and Th1 functions.

108,2021,22741032,"This review attempts to move beyond the traditional borders of antiangiogenesis and toward the dynamic, evolving strategies of vascular modulation. This repositioning entails a two-fold paradigm shift: conceptually, to a view of antiangiogenesis as only one part of a larger story, and therapeutically, to approaches which attempt to modulate tumor blood flow instead of simply inhibiting it. Three vascular modulation strategies-provascular, antivascular, and redistributive-are presented with representative compounds. These vascular modulation strategies are described in specific measurable characteristics (blood vessel maturity and type, effect on blood flow, microenvironmental target, molecular target, angiogenic biomarker, and imaging biomarkers) that will help define the tumor types that are more susceptible to a particular vascular modulation strategy thereby guiding therapeutic agent selection and enabling a personalized medicine approach.",Is starving a fever effective?,"starve a fever, feed a cold",0.0,Is starving a fever effective?,0.002081112004816532

We identified 69 studies and applied meta-analysis, meta-regression and dose-response analysis to obtain available evidence. The results indicated that high selenium exposure had a protective effect on cancer risk (pooled OR = 0.78; 95%CI: 0.73-0.83). The results of linear and nonlinear dose-response analysis indicated that high serum/plasma selenium and toenail selenium had the efficacy on cancer prevention. However, we did not find a protective efficacy of selenium supplement. High selenium exposure may have different effects on specific types of cancer.

109,2021,19514899,"Selenium is an essential trace element with antioxidative, antimutagenic, antiviral and anticarcinogenic properties. There is increasing evidence that the dietary selenium intakes are sub-optimal in the populations of many countries and that human cancer mortalities would significantly decline if additional selenium was made available either through supplementation or the fortification of certain foods. An important property of selenium is its interaction with other elements that may be present in foods, the water, the workplace and the environment, e.g. As, Cu, Ni, Co, Cr, Mn, Zn, Cd, Sn, Pb, Hg, Bi, Mo, Ag, Au, etc. The sequestration of elements by selenium represents an efficient natural detoxification mechanism for some of these elements but also results in the physiological inactivation of selenium. Animal experiments confirm that the chronic exposure to low levels of these elements abolishes the cancer-protective effect of selenium. Human cancer is likewise significantly determined by the interactions of selenium with other elements, as evidenced by epidemiological, ecological and case-control studies. Cadmium, for example, is a key risk-increasing element for prostate cancer; for breast cancer, Cd, Cr, Zn are mainly contributing; for bronchial cancer (in smelter workers), Cd, As, Cr, Sb, Co, La, all these elements are in a reciprocal relationship with Se. While selenium remains the key cancer-protective trace element, the interpretation of its mode of action necessitates consideration of the effects of selenium antagonistic elements.",Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,0.6628907918930054

The toxic effects of selenium are, however, strictly concentration and chemical species dependent. One class of selenium compounds is a potent inhibitor of cell growth with remarkable tumor specificity. These redox active compounds are pro-oxidative and highly cytotoxic to tumor cells and are promising candidates to be used in chemotherapy against cancer. Herein we elaborate upon the major forms of dietary selenium compounds, their metabolic pathways, and their antioxidant and pro-oxidant potentials with emphasis on cytotoxic mechanisms.

Selenium intake has been traditionally quantified as glutathioneperoxidase activity or selenium concentration in blood or tissues. However, these indexes do not reflect organic selenium intake. Effect of dietary supplementation of rats with selenomethylselenocysteine on the blood plasma proteome was investigated in order to detect protein abundance differences between experimental (supranutritional selenium supplementation) and control [minimum selenium dose and sodium selenate instead of selenomethylselenocysteine (SeMSeCys)] groups. Four experimental groups and six control groups consisting of six rats each were fed with base diet supplemented with SeMSeCys or sodium selenate in different concentrations for different periods of time. A proteomic approach, comprising two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, was used to assess protein abundance in blood plasma. Statistically significant differences in the abundance of some proteins were detected in all the experimental groups. Four proteins were found to increase their abundance in response to the experimental conditions: apolipoprotein E, haptoglobin and alpha-1-antitrypsin abundance was related to the extent of supplementation period and transthyretin in response to SeMSeCys dose. Apolipoprotein E and transthyretin were not differentially expressed when diets were supplemented with sodium selenate instead of SeMSeCys.

109,2021,23486107,"Selenium (Se³⁴₇₉) is a metalloid which is close to sulfur (S) in terms of properties. The Se concentration in soil varies with type, texture and organic matter content of the soil and with rainfall. Its assimilation by plants is influenced by the physico-chemical properties of the soil (redox status, pH and microbial activity). The presence of Se in the atmosphere is linked to natural and anthropogenic activities. Selenoproteins, in which selenium is present as selenocysteine, present an important role in many body functions, such as antioxidant defense and the formation of thyroid hormones. Some selenoprotein metabolites play a role in cancer prevention. In the immune system, selenium stimulates antibody formation and activity of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells. The mechanisms of intestinal absorption of selenium differ depending on the chemical form of the element. Selenium is mainly absorbed in the duodenum and caecum by active transport through a sodium pump. The recommended daily intake of selenium varies from 60 μg/day for women, to 70 μg/day for men. In growing ruminants the requirements are estimated at 100 μg/kg dry matter and 200 μg/Kg for pregnant or lactating females.

In the present study, untreated oral cancer cases (Gp II) were compared with radiation-treated groups with and without selenium (Gp IIa, IIb), forward to find the trace elements and cancer biomarkers status, at a follow-up of 6 months. Severe alteration in the trace elements levels of Se, Cu, Fe, Zn, Na, K, Ca, Cl, were noticed in Gp II. Though Gp IIa showed slight improvement, administration of selenium (Gp IIb) improved the level of all these elements to a greater extent (p 0.001). GpII and IIa showed increased level of bio markers 5’-nucleotidase, PschE, LAP, γ-GTP, LDH, SGOT, SGPT, ACP, ALP, CPK, TNF, CEA, AFP, Scc-Ag. The greater extent of restitution to near normalcy was observed in patients given selenium (Gp IIb) (p 0.001).

110,2021,15705922,"We describe the clinical course of three women with presumptive autoimmune oophoritis who developed multiple follicles but very low to undetectable estradiol levels. Multiple follicles developed spontaneously in all subjects and during pulsatile GnRH treatment for ovulation induction in subject 1. The development of multiple dominant follicles was accompanied by LH levels in the postmenopausal range and FSH levels at the upper limit for premenopausal women. Serum inhibin B levels were elevated appropriately in the setting of multifollicular development, but estradiol levels remained low. Measurement of estradiol precursors demonstrated androstenedione and estrone levels below the 95th percentile in normal women. Adrenal cortical antibodies, and antibodies to 21-hydroxylase and P450 side chain cleavage enzymes were identified in all subjects. All subjects met the criteria for premature ovarian failure during follow-up. Subject 1 later developed adrenal failure, whereas subject 3 had adrenal failure at the time of the study. These subjects elucidate the hormonal pattern in autoimmune oophoritis, before the full criteria for premature ovarian failure are met. The elevated inhibin A and B levels, which accompany the development of multiple small and dominant follicles in these women, suppress FSH relative to LH levels, virtually independent of estradiol. These data provide further evidence for an important role of inhibin B and inhibin A in the negative feedback control of FSH. In addition, the normal inhibin A and inhibin B production in the absence of estradiol precursors and estradiol provide insight into the selective dysfunction of the theca cells in autoimmune oophoritis.",Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,birth control pill ovarian cysts treatment,0.0,Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,0.7443995475769043

Methods: Eighty patients in whom ultrasonography revealed unilateral, mobile, unilocular, thin-walled ovarian cysts without internal echoes and greater than 30 mm but not exceeding 60 mm in diameter were enrolled into the study. Patients were randomized by stratification to receive a low-dose monophasic pill, a high-dose monophasic pill, a multiphasic pill or no therapy. Patients were re-evaluated after 5 weeks of therapy and at the end of therapy (10 weeks). Results: The mean ages and the mean cyst diameters of the patients for each group were not significantly different. We did not find a significant effect of oral contraceptive administration on the disappearance rate of functional ovarian cysts over that of expectant management.

Percentage zinc absorption was significantly lower than controls in fasting women receiving iron- containing prenatal supplements (20.5 +/- 6.4 vs. 20.2 +/- 4.6 vs. 47.0 +/- 12.6%, Fe, Fe + Zn and C groups, respectively, P: 0.0001, n = 40). Plasma zinc concentrations were also significantly lower in the Fe group compared to the C group (8.2 +/- 2.2 vs. 9.2 +/- 2.2 vs. 10.9 +/- 1. 8 micromol/L, Fe, Fe + Zn and C groups, respectively, P: = 0.002), and cord zinc concentrations were significantly related to maternal plasma Zn levels (y = 6.383 + 0.555x, r = 0.486, P: = 0.002). The inclusion of zinc in prenatal supplements may reduce the potential for iron supplements to adversely influence zinc status in populations at risk for deficiency of both these nutrients.",Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,zinc supplements pregnancy,0.0,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,0.6144036650657654
111,2021,34368474,"Zinc is an essential trace element involved in different physiological functions. During pregnancy, it plays a crucial role in healthy embryogenesis. This umbrella review, therefore, aimed to summarize the existing literature of meta-analyses evaluating the effect of maternal zinc supplementation or zinc status on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Two databases, PubMed and Scopus, were selected to search the available literature without any temporal restriction. The literature search was performed during October 2020 and a total of 192 records were identified through the literature search. After screening the titles and applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, finally, 15 articles were included in this umbrella review. This umbrella review showed that maternal zinc supplements reduce the risk of preterm birth. Although no substantial effect of zinc supplements was found for other feto-maternal outcomes. Also, we found a significant relationship between low maternal zinc status and risk of pregnancy complications. Zinc supplements reduce the risk of preterm birth. Long-term interventions and cohort studies are needed for future research directions.

111,2021,9810544,"Background: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether such supplementation impairs the zinc status of pregnant women or the zinc content of maternal milk. Material and methods: Fifty seven women were studied during pregnancy and lactation. Zinc, iron and folate intakes were monitored during the third trimester of pregnancy using a five day food record and by registering intake of the same in the form of dietary supplements. Zinc levels were determined, using flame-atomic-absorption spectrophotometry, in serum during the third trimester of pregnancy, in transition milk (day 13-14 of lactation), and in mature milk (day 40 of lactation). Results: 1.8% of pregnant women took zinc supplements whilst 7% took folate supplements. However, 100% of subjects showed zinc intakes (the sum of dietary and supplementary intakes) lower than those recommended. 87.7% showed the same for folate intake, 29.8% of pregnant women took iron supplements. When dietary and supplementary intakes were added, 26.3% of subjects showed iron intakes of over 200% of those recommended. Pregnant women with iron intakes in the third trimester of pregnancy of over 200% those recommended, showed lower serum zinc levels during the third trimester and, at a later date, lower mature milk zinc levels than did subjects with lower iron intakes. Conclusions: The combined dietary and supplementary intake of iron in some subjects provided total intakes of over 200% those recommended. Though this might be associated with an improvement in iron status it may impair those of zinc. Subjects with an intake of iron of over 200% of that recommended showed significantly lower serum and mature milk zinc levels than did those with lower iron intakes.

The women were randomized into either a control (C) or a zinc-supplemented (Z) group and received similar vitamin and mineral supplements except that 20 mg zinc was added to the Z group's capsules. At the final interview, women (C + Z) with low serum Zn levels (less than or equal to 53 micrograms/dl) had higher (p less than 0.01) mean ribonuclease activity and lower (p less than 0.01) mean delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity than women with acceptable serum zinc levels. The incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension was higher (p less than 0.003) in the C than in the Z group, but pregnancy-induced hypertension was not associated with low serum zinc levels at either the initial or final interview. The expected increase in serum copper levels was greater (less than 0.001) in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension (C + Z) than in normotensives.

Therefore, we compared the birth weights of neonates born to mothers who consumed zinc supplement during pregnancy with that of neonates born to mothers who did not. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we divided 200 pregnant mothers into two groups: case group (mothers receiving zinc supplement during pregnancy) and control group (mothers not receiving zinc supplement during pregnancy) Then, the neonate's cord zinc level and mother's serum level were measured and neonate's growth charts (weight, height and head circumference)were completed. Results: In this study, both groups of mothers were observed to have zinc deficiency; 35% of the mothers who consumed zinc supplements and 81% of the mothers who did not consume zinc supplements (P 0.001). Based on the results, maternal serum of zinc (P 0.001), neonatal birth weight (P = 0.008), maternal age (P 0.001) and parity (P 0.01) in zinc-supplemented group were higher. Neonatal birth weight was associated moderately with mother's zinc serum levels and poorly with neonatal serum zinc levels.

This study was designed to determine the effects of zinc supplementation on glucose homeostasis parameters and lipid concentrations in GDM women. Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed among 58 women diagnosed with GDM, primigravida and aged 18-40years old. Patients were randomly divided into two groups to receive 233mg zinc gluconate (containing 30mg zinc) supplements (n=29) or placebo (n=29) per day for 6weeks. Fasting blood samples were taken at the beginning and end of the trial to quantify glucose, insulin and lipid concentrations. Results: Patients who received zinc supplements had significantly higher serum zinc concentrations (+6.9±13.2 vs. -1.5±16.5mg/dL, P=0.03) than those received the placebo. In addition, zinc-supplemented patients had reduced fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (-6.6±11.2 vs. +0.6±6.7mg/dL, P=0.005), serum insulin levels (-1.3±6.6 vs. +6.6±12.2μIU/mL, P=0.003), homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (-0.5±1.6 vs. +1.5±2.7, P=0.001), homeostatic model assessment-Beta cell function (HOMA-B) (-0.7±25.0 vs. +26.5±49.5, P=0.01) and increased quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (+0.01±0.01 vs. -0.01±0.02, P=0.004) compared with the placebo.

111,2021,10357748,"Background: Maternal zinc deficiency during pregnancy may be widespread among women in developing countries, but few data are available on whether prenatal zinc supplementation improves maternal and neonatal zinc status. Objective: We studied whether maternal zinc supplementation improved the zinc status of mothers and neonates participating in a supplementation trial in a shantytown in Lima, Peru. Design: Beginning at gestation week 10-24, 1295 mothers were randomly assigned to receive prenatal supplements containing 60 mg Fe and 250 microg folate, with or without 15 mg Zn. Venous blood and urine samples were collected at enrollment, at gestation week 28-30, and at gestation week 37-38. At birth, a sample of cord vein blood was collected. We measured serum zinc concentrations in 538 women, urinary zinc concentrations in 521 women, and cord zinc concentrations in 252 neonates. Results: At 28-30 and 37-38 wk, mothers receiving zinc supplements had higher serum zinc concentrations than mothers who did not receive zinc (8.8 +/- 1.9 compared with 8.4 +/- 1.5 micromol/L and 8.6 +/- 1.5 compared with 8.3 +/- 1.4 micromol/L, respectively). Urinary zinc concentrations were also higher in mothers who received supplemental zinc (P 0.05). After adjustment for covariates and confounding factors, neonates of mothers receiving zinc supplements had higher cord zinc concentrations than neonates of mothers who did not receive zinc (12.7 +/- 2.3 compared with 12.1 +/- 2.1 micromol/L). Despite supplementation, maternal and neonatal zinc concentrations remained lower than values reported for well-nourished populations. Conclusion: Adding zinc to prenatal iron and folate tablets improved maternal and neonatal zinc status, but higher doses of zinc are likely needed to further improve maternal and neonatal zinc status in this population.",Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,zinc supplements pregnancy,0.0,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,0.9986045956611633
111,2021,10617955,"Background: Maternal zinc supplementation has been suggested as a potential intervention to reduce the incidence of low birth weight in developing countries. To date, placebo-controlled trials have all been performed in industrialized countries and the results are inconsistent. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether zinc supplementation in Bangladeshi urban poor during the last 2 trimesters of pregnancy was associated with pregnancy outcome. Design: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 559 women from Dhaka slums, stratified by parity between 12 and 16 wk of gestation, were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg elemental Zn/d (n = 269) or placebo (n = 290). Supplementation continued until delivery. Serum zinc was estimated at baseline and at 7 mo of gestation. Dietary intake was assessed at baseline and anthropometric measurements were made monthly. Weight, length, and gestational ages of 410 singleton newborns were measured within 72 h of birth. Results: At 7 mo of gestation, serum zinc concentrations tended to be higher in the zinc-supplemented group than in the placebo group (15.9 +/- 4.4 compared with 15.2 +/- 4.3 micromol/L). No significant effect of treatment was observed on infant birth weight (2513 +/- 390 compared with 2554 +/- 393 g; NS) or on gestational age, infant length, or head, chest, or midupper arm circumference. The incidence and distribution of low birth weight, prematurity, and smallness for gestational age also did not differ significantly after zinc supplementation. Conclusions: Supplementation with 30 mg elemental Zn during the last 2 trimesters of pregnancy did not improve birth outcome in Bangladeshi urban poor.

111,2021,2183334,"There seems to be a zinc deficiency during pregnancy in view of the low serum zinc levels, but especially low zinc levels in hair and leucocytes. The need for zinc supplements is still ill-defined but represents at least 5 mg per day which are not covered by the diet and taken from the maternal reserves. Therefore the risk of deficiency is real and its manifestations are numerous. There is a risk of spontaneous abortion, gravidic toxemia, treatment-resistant anemia, abnormally prolonged gestation and difficult delivery for the mother. As for the fetus, with zinc deficiency there is a risk of hypotrophism and malformations with potentialization of the teratogenic effect of alcohol and many medications. Besides, in animals, zinc deficiency during pregnancy results in late effects several months after birth: decrease immunity, learning or memory disorders. In view of all these consequences, administration of supplements is imperative and must be evaluated providing that it does not exceed 50 mg of zinc per day.

112,2021,23633319,"Background: Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition, which usually develops in early childhood. Many children outgrow this disorder as they reach secondary school age, and although It may improve with age, there is no cure. Constant itch makes life uncomfortable for those with this condition, no matter what age they are, so it may have a significant effect on a person's quality of life. Its prevalence seems to be increasing as populations move from rural locations to cities. Some people, who do not see an adequate improvement or fear side-effects of conventional medical products, try complementary alternatives to conventional treatment. This is a review of evening primrose oil (EPO) and borage oil (BO) taken orally (by mouth); these have been thought to be beneficial because of their gamma-linolenic acid content. Objectives: To assess the effects of oral evening primrose oil or borage oil for treating the symptoms of atopic eczema. Search methods: We searched the following databases up to August 2012: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), AMED (from 1985), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registers and checked the bibliographies of included studies for further references to relevant trials. We corresponded with trial investigators and pharmaceutical companies to try to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We performed a separate search for adverse effects of evening primrose oil and borage oil in November 2011. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled, parallel, or cross-over trials investigating oral intake of evening primrose oil or borage oil for eczema. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently applied eligibility criteria, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We pooled dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR), and continuous outcomes using the mean difference (MD). Where possible, we pooled study results using random-effects meta-analysis and tested statistical heterogeneity using both the Chi(²) test and the I(²) statistic test. We presented results using forest plots with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results: A total of 27 studies (1596 participants) met the inclusion criteria: 19 studies assessed evening primrose oil, and 8 studies assessed borage oil. For EPO, a meta-analysis of results from 7 studies showed that EPO failed to significantly increase improvement in global eczema symptoms as reported by participants on a visual analogue scale of 0 to 100 (MD -2.22, 95% CI -10.48 to 6.04, 176 participants, 7 trials) and a visual analogue scale of 0 to 100 for medical doctors (MD -3.26, 95% CI -6.96 to 0.45, 289 participants, 8 trials) compared to the placebo group.Treatment with BO also failed to significantly improve global eczema symptoms compared to placebo treatment as reported by both participants and medical doctors, although we could not conduct a meta-analysis as studies reported results in different ways. With regard to the risk of bias, the majority of studies were of low risk of bias; we judged 67% of the included studies as having low risk of bias for random sequence generation; 44%, for allocation concealment; 59%, for blinding; and 37%, for other biases. Implications for practice: Oral borage oil and evening primrose oil lack effect on eczema; improvement was similar to respective placebos used in trials. Oral BO and EPO are not effective treatments for eczema.In these studies, along with the placebos, EPO and BO have the same, fairly common, mild, transient adverse effects, which are mainly gastrointestinal.The short-term studies included here do not examine possible adverse effects of long-term use of EPO or BO. A case report warned that if EPO is taken for a prolonged period of time (more than one year), there is a potential risk of inflammation, thrombosis, and immunosuppression; another study found that EPO may increase bleeding for people on Coumadin® (warfarin) medication. Implications for research: Noting that the confidence intervals between active and placebo treatment are narrow, to exclude the possibility of any clinically useful difference, we concluded that further studies on EPO or BO for eczema would be hard to justify.This review does not provide information about long-term use of these products.",Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,evening primrose oil eczema,0.0,Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,0.2178991734981537

Evening primrose oil (EPO) as a source of GLA has been of interest in the management of AD. Objective: The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EPO in Korean patients with AD. Methods: Fifty mild AD patients with an Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) score of 10 or less were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups. The first group received an oval unmarked capsule containing 450 mg of EPO (40 mg of GLA) per capsule, while placebo capsules identical in appearance and containing 450 mg of soybean oil were given to the other group.

112,2021,1318129,"Recently a defect in the function of the enzyme delta-6-desaturase has been discussed as a major factor in the development of atopic eczema. Delta-6-desaturase is responsible for the conversion of linoleic acid to gamma linolenic acid. Several plants, including evening primrose, are known to be fairly rich in gamma linolenic acid. Hence, substitution of gamma linolenic acid in patients prone to developing atopic eczema seems like a feasible concept. During the last few years different clinical trials have been performed. Controlled trials following a parallel study design showed marked improvement in atopic eczema. Patients treated with the drug showed less inflammation, dryness, scaling and overall severity compared to controls. Although these findings have been supported by meta-analysis, there is still conflicting evidence in trials based on a crossover design alone, demonstrating a decrease in itching. At present, evening primrose oil in doses used for the treatment of atopic eczema is considered safe.

In addition, the optimal dose and duration of treatment with evening primrose oil have not yet been determined. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the dose-response treatment effects of evening primrose oil on clinical symptoms of AD and serum concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Methods: Forty AD patients were enrolled for the study and randomly divided into 2 groups: those who received evening primrose oil 160 mg daily for 8 weeks and those who received 320 mg of evening primrose oil twice daily for 8 weeks. We evaluated the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) scores of all AD patients at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 8. In addition, we measured the levels of serum fatty acids, including C16 : 0 (palmitic), C18 : 2n (linoleic), C18 : 3n (linolenic) and C20 : 4 (arachidonic acid) using gas chromatography. Results: The serum fatty acid levels C18 : 3n and C20 : 4 were higher in the 320 mg group than in the 160 mg group, with statistical significance. After evening primrose oil treatment, EASI scores were reduced in the 2 groups. The improvement in EASI scores was greater in the 320 mg group than in the 160 mg group. There were no side effects seen in either group during the study in the 2 groups.

113,2021,22157878,"Purpose: Ankle sprains are one of the most common injuries in competitive and recreational athletics. Studies have shown that the use of prophylactic ankle braces effectively reduces the frequency of ankle sprains in athletes. However, although it is generally accepted that the ankle braces are effective at reducing frontal plane motion, some researchers report that the design of the brace may also reduce ankle sagittal plane motion. The purpose of this study was to quantify lower extremity joint contributions to energy absorption during single-legged drop landings in three ankle brace conditions (no brace, boot brace, and hinged brace). Methods: Eleven physically active females experienced in landing and free of lower extremity injury (age = 22.3 ± 1.7 yr, height = 1.66 ± 0.04 m, mass = 58.43 ± 5.83 kg) performed 10 single-leg drop landings in three conditions (one unbraced, two braced) from a 0.33-m height. Measurements taken were hip, knee, and ankle joint impulse; hip, knee, ankle, and total work; and hip, knee, and ankle joint relative work. Results: Total energy absorption remained consistent across the braced conditions (P = 0.057).

113,2021,30651184,"Lateral ankle sprains are common injuries in quick, dynamic movements and are caused by rapid ankle inversion. Ankle braces are used to reduce ankle inversion, while allowing normal plantar and dorsiflexion ranges of motion. Knee injuries, such as anterior cruciate ligament injuries, are also common in dynamic movements. It is important to understand how ankle braces affect injury risk at other proximal joints. There is limited and conflicting results on how ankle braces affect knee mechanics during these types of movements. Additionally, it is unknown if sex differences exist when using an ankle brace. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a hinged ankle brace and sex during a 45° cutting movement. Three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction forces were collected using a motion capture system and force plate on ten men and eight women during cutting trials. 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVAs were used to detect differences in ground reaction forces, as well as knee and ankle kinematics between brace conditions and sex (p 0.05). The brace condition exhibited greater initial contact ankle dorsiflexion (p = 0.011), decreased peak ankle inversion (p 0.01), and increased vertical loading rate (p = 0.040). Females performed the cutting movement with less initial contact (p = 0.019) and peak knee flexion (p = 0.023) compared to males. Ankle bracing had no impact on the observed sex differences. Females exhibited decreased knee flexion compared to males, which has been well documented in the literature.

113,2021,30300098,"Context: The lateral ankle sprain is one of the most common lower-extremity injuries in sports. Previous research has found that some prophylactic ankle supports reduce the risk of recurrent ankle sprains and provide extra support to the joint. However, there is a continued concern that these supports may negatively influence performance. Objective: To determine if wearing an ankle brace influences athlete performance and ankle kinematics during functional performance tests. Design: Repeated measures. Setting: University gymnasium. Other participants: Male and female recreational or competitive athletes (n = 20). Intervention: Participants performed 3 trials of a standing long jump, vertical jump, 40-yard sprint, and T-drill under each of the following 3 conditions: wearing traditional lace-up brace (brace 1), modified lace-up brace (brace 2), and no-brace. Main outcome measures: A 2-dimensional motion capture camera was used to measure ankle range of motion (ROM) in the sagittal plane during the vertical and standing long jumps and in the frontal plane during the cutting phase of the T-drill. Performance of each test and ankle ROM were compared between each of the braced conditions. Results: Ankle braces did not influence performance in speed or agility functional performance tests (P &gt; .05). Ankle braces negatively affected performance of the standing long jump (P = .01) and vertical jump (P = .01). There was no significant difference between brace or no-brace conditions in ankle inversion ROM during the T-drill (P &gt; .05). Both brace conditions restricted ROM in the sagittal plane during the vertical and standing long jumps (P .05). Conclusions: Braced conditions restricted sagittal plane ROM during the vertical jump and long jump. This decrease in ROM explains the decline in functional performance also seen during these tests.",Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,ankle brace broken ankle,1.0,Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,0.5601860284805298
113,2021,31080818,"An ankle brace is commonly used by patients after they suffer from initial ankle sprains, reducing the incidents of recurrent sprain or limiting laxity in joints with functional ankle instability (FAI). However, whether the application of a semirigid ankle brace can improve the abnormal ankle gait kinematics of patients with FAI remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the effect of a semirigid ankle brace on the gait kinematics of ankle joints through 3D-2D fluoroscopy image registration. A total of 8 subjects with FAI (3 males and 5 females, 10 feet) as FAI group and 10 subjects without FAI (6 males and 4 females, 10 feet) as control group were enrolled in this study. Three-dimensional bone models created from computed tomography images were matched to fluoroscopic images to compute the 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) talocrural, subtalar, and ankle joints complex kinematics for control and FAI group with or without brace during the stance phase of walking. FAI patients had significantly less ROMs in inversion/eversion rotation of the talocrural and subtalar joint after wearing semirigid ankle brace. Laxity was observed in most of the displacements of the talocrural and subtalar joints in FAI group. The brace partly altered the ankle joints movement in opposite directions, especially joint rotation, and restricted the talocrural and subtalar joints in the dorsiflexion position during the touch down phase of walking.",Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,ankle brace broken ankle,1.0,Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,0.03670499101281166

Objective: To determine the effects of a prophylactic ankle brace on knee joint varus-valgus and internal-external rotation torque during a drop landing onto a slanted surface. Design: A repeated-measures design. Setting: Biomechanics research laboratory. Patients or other participants: Twenty-four physically active college students. Intervention(s): Participants were tested in a brace and no brace condition. Main outcome measure(s): We measured 3 dependent variables:(1) peak ankle inversion-eversion torque, (2) peak knee varus-valgus torque, and (3) peak knee internal-external rotation torque. A force plate was used to collect ground reaction force data, and 6 motion analysis cameras collected kinematic data during the unilateral drop landing. An adjustable bar was hung from the ceiling, and a slant board was positioned over the center of the force plate, so that the ankle of the participant's dominant leg would invert upon landing. Peak torque was measure din both the brace and no-brace conditions. The average of the peak values in 3 trials for both conditions was used for the statistical analysis. Results: Ankle eversion torque was significantly greater in the brace condition (F1,23 19.75, P .01). Knee external rotation torque was significantly greater in the brace condition(F1,23 4.33, P .05). Valgus knee torque was smaller in the brace condition, but the difference was not statistically significant(F1,23 3.45, P .08). Conclusions: This study provides an important first step in understanding the effects of prophylactic ankle bracing on other joints of the lower extremity.

113,2021,23948246,"Objectives: External ankle support has been successfully used to prevent ankle sprains. However, some recent studies have indicated that reducing ankle range of motion can place larger loads on the knee. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of external ankle support (braces and high-top shoes) on the ankle and knee joint loading during a netball specific landing task. Design: A repeated measure design. Methods: High performance netball players with no previously diagnosed severe ankle or knee injury (n=11) were recruited from NSW Institute of Sport netball programme. The kinematic and kinetic data were collected simultaneously using a 3-D Motion Analysis System and one Kistler force plate to measure ground reaction forces. Players performed a single leg landing whilst receiving a pass while wearing a standard netball shoe, the same shoe with a lace-up brace and a high-top shoe. Results: Only the brace condition significantly reduced the ankle range of motion in the frontal plane (in/eversion) by 3.95 ± 3.74 degrees compared to the standard condition. No changes were found for the knee joint loading in the brace condition. The high-top shoes acted to increase the peak knee internal rotation moment by 15%. Both the brace and high-top conditions brought about increases in the peak ankle plantar flexion moment during the landing phase.

113,2021,27872123,"Background: Despite the high prevalence of lower extremity injuries in female basketball players as well as a high proportion of athletes who wear ankle braces, there is a paucity of research pertaining to the effects of ankle bracing on ankle and knee biomechanics during basketball-specific tasks. Purpose: To compare the effects of a lace-up brace (ASO), a hinged brace (Active T2), and no ankle bracing (control) on ankle and knee joint kinematics and joint reaction forces in female basketball athletes during a cutting maneuver. Study design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Twenty healthy, semi-elite female basketball players performed a cutting task under both ankle brace conditions (lace-up ankle brace and hinged ankle brace) and a no-brace condition. The 3-dimensional kinematics of the ankle and knee during the cutting maneuver were measured with an 18-camera motion analysis system (250 Hz), and ground-reaction force data were collected by use of a multichannel force plate (2000 Hz) to quantify ankle and knee joint reaction forces. Conditions were randomized using a block randomization method. Results: Compared with the control condition, the hinged ankle brace significantly restricted peak ankle inversion (mean difference, 1.7°; P = .023). No significant difference was found between the lace-up brace and the control condition ( P = .865). Compared with the lace-up brace, the hinged brace significantly reduced ankle and knee joint compressive forces at the time of peak ankle dorsiflexion (mean difference, 1.5 N/kg [ P = .018] and 1.4 N/kg [ P = .013], respectively). Additionally, the hinged ankle brace significantly reduced knee anterior shear forces compared with the lace-up brace both during the deceleration phase and at peak ankle dorsiflexion (mean difference, 0.8 N/kg [ P = .018] and 0.9 N/kg [ P = .011], respectively). Conclusion: The hinged ankle brace significantly reduced ankle inversion compared with the no-brace condition and reduced ankle and knee joint forces compared with the lace-up brace in a female basketball population during a cutting task. Compared with the lace-up brace, the hinged brace may be a better choice of prophylactic ankle support for female basketball players from a biomechanical perspective. However, both braces increased knee internal rotation and knee abduction angles, which may be problematic for a population that already has a high prevalence of knee injuries.",Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,ankle brace broken ankle,1.0,Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,0.6896533966064453
113,2021,34957079,"Half-squat parachuting landing is a kind of activity with high impact force. Injuries on lower-extremity joints are common in half-squat parachuting landing and would be increased with a backpack. An ankle brace was used to prevent ankle injuries in landing. However, few quantitative studies reported about the protection of an ankle brace for lower-extremity joints in half-squat parachuting landing with a backpack. This study focused on evaluating the protective effects of an ankle brace in half-squat parachuting landing with a backpack. Seven male participants landed from 120 cm with a backpack and an ankle brace. Each participant performed three landing trials on every experimental condition. Kinetics and kinematics of the hip, knee, and ankle were analyzed. It was found that the ankle brace did not significantly affect the ground reaction force with backpack but increased the ground reaction force from 14.7 ± 2.0 bodyweight to 16.2 ± 1.9 bodyweight ( p = 0.017) without the backpack. The ankle brace significantly ( p 0.05) decreased the angular displacement, angular velocity, and angular acceleration of the ankle both without and with the backpack. In conclusion, the ankle brace could restrict ankle motion and significantly increase ground reaction force without the backpack. However, the ankle brace did not significantly influence ground reaction force and still restricted ankle motion with the backpack. Therefore, the ankle brace was more effective in half-squat parachuting landing with the backpack than no-backpack landing.",Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,ankle brace broken ankle,1.0,Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,0.438101589679718

The motion-capture system was adopted to capture the three-dimensional coordinates of the reflective markers. The coordinates of the reflective markers were used to compute the ankle kinematics during simulated ankle supination. A mechanical supination platform was used to simulate the sprain motions. Experimental results showed that the semi-rigid brace tested significantly reduced the ankle angular displacement and angular velocity compared with control conditions during sudden supination. In conclusion, the semi-rigid-type brace can provide significant restriction to reduce the magnitudes of the angular displacement and angular velocity of the ankle during sudden supination sprain.

114,2021,10417589,"Background: Vitamin E is a generic term for a group of tocol and tocotrienol derivatives. Since the discovery that vitamin E is the major lipid soluble antioxidant in skin, this substance has been tried for the treatment of almost every type of skin lesion imaginable. Anecdotal reports claim that vitamin E speeds wound healing and improves the cosmetic outcome of burns and other wounds. Many lay people use vitamin E on a regular basis to improve the outcome of scars and several physicians recommend topical vitamin E after skin surgery or resurfacing. Objective: We attempted to determine whether topically applied vitamin E has any effect on the cosmetic appearance of scars as suggested by multiple anectodal reports. Methods: Fifteen patients who had undergone skin cancer removal surgery were enrolled in the study. All wounds were primarily closed in 2 layers. After the surgery, the patients were given two ointments each labeled A or B. A was Aquaphor, a regular emollient, and the B was Aquaphor mixed with vitamin E. The scars were randomly divided into parts A and B. Patients were asked to put the A ointment on part A and the B ointment on part B twice daily for 4 weeks. The study was double blinded. The physicians and the patients independently evaluated the scars for cosmetic appearance on Weeks 1, 4, and 12. The criteria was simply to recognize which side of the scar looked better if there was any difference. The patients' and the physicians' opinions were recorded. A third blinded investigator was shown photographs of the outcomes and their opinion was also noted. Results: The results of this study show that topically applied vitamin E does not help in improving the cosmetic appearance of scars and leads to a high incidence of contact dermatitis. Conclusions: This study shows that there is no benefit to the cosmetic outcome of scars by applying vitamin E after skin surgery and that the application of topical vitamin E may actually be detrimental to the cosmetic appearance of a scar. In 90% of the cases in this study, topical vitamin E either had no effect on, or actually worsened, the cosmetic appearance of scars. Of the patients studied, 33% developed a contact dermatitis to the vitamin E.

Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of topical tocotrienol in preventing the development of hypertrophic scars. Methods: A prospective, randomised, double-blinded study was performed on 122 patients with recently healed ( 2 weeks) surgical scars, who were randomised into either a treatment group with 5% topical tocotrienol or a placebo group. The patients were required to apply the preparation to their scars twice a day for 6 weeks starting at 2 weeks after surgery. Assessments of the scars were performed at weeks 0, 2, 6 and 16 following the onset of topical application using three methods: a clinical assessment using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), a photographic scar assessment by two independent assessors using a visual analogue scale and laser Doppler imaging (LDI). Data analysis was performed on 85 patients (tocotrienol group: 45 patients; placebo group: 40 patients), who had completed four assessments. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in scar parameters between the tocotrienol and the placebo groups in the POSAS, photographic scar assessment or mean flux of LDI (p&gt;0.05) categories. The mean LDI flux showed a decreasing trend over time, which was positively correlated with vascularity (correlation coefficient=0.325, p=0.008) and total scores (correlation coefficient=0.248, p=0.034) of the observer scar assessment scale on week 0.

Hypertrophic scars are among the most common and frustrating problems after injury. As current aesthetic surgical techniques become more standardized and results more predictable, a fine scar may be the demarcating line between acceptable and unacceptable aesthetic results.

115,2021,26404370,"Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body. It has been recognized as a cofactor for more than 300 enzymatic reactions, where it is crucial for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) metabolism. Magnesium is required for DNA and RNA synthesis, reproduction, and protein synthesis. Moreover, magnesium is essential for the regulation of muscular contraction, blood pressure, insulin metabolism, cardiac excitability, vasomotor tone, nerve transmission and neuromuscular conduction. Imbalances in magnesium status-primarily hypomagnesemia as it is seen more common than hypermagnesemia-might result in unwanted neuromuscular, cardiac or nervous disorders. Based on magnesium's many functions within the human body, it plays an important role in prevention and treatment of many diseases.

Study design: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Electronic databases, namely EMBASE, PubMed, the Wanfang Data Chinese Database, and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database were searched from inception to February 24, 2015. Methods: This review was conducted according to the guidelines of the PRISMA. Only RCTs evaluating the effects of intravenous or oral magnesium on migraine compared with a control group were included. Results: A total of 21 studies were included. Of which, 11 studies investigated the effects of intravenous magnesium on acute migraine (948 participants) and 10 examined the effects of oral magnesium on migraine prophylaxis (789 participants). Intravenous magnesium significantly relieved acute migraine within 15 - 45 minutes, 120 minutes, and 24 hours after the initial infusion (Odd ratios [ORs] = 0.23, 0.20, and 0.25, respectively).

115,2021,22895810,"Given the conflicting results about the positive effects of magnesium and L-carnitine and as there is no report concerning concurrent supplementation of magnesium and L-carnitine on migraine prophylaxis, the effects of magnesium, L-carnitine, and concurrent magnesium-L-carnitine supplementation on migraine indicators were assessed. In this clinical trial, 133 migrainous patients were randomly assigned into three intervention groups: magnesium oxide (500 mg/day), L-carnitine (500 mg/day), and Mg-L-carnitine (500 mg/day magnesium and 500 mg/day L-carnitine), and a control group. After 12 weeks of supplementation, the checklist of migraine indicators including migraine attacks/month, migraine days/month, and headache severity was completed, and serum concentrations of magnesium and L-carnitine were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and enzymatic UV test, respectively. The results showed a significant reduction in all migraine indicators in all studied groups (p 0.05). The ANOVA results showed a significant reduction in migraine frequency across various supplemented and control groups (p = 0.008). By separating the effects of magnesium supplementation from other confounding factors such as routine treatments using the repeated measures and nested model, it was clarified that magnesium supplementation had a significant effect on all migraine indicators. Oral supplementation with magnesium oxide and L-carnitine and concurrent supplementation of Mg-L-carnitine besides routine treatments could be effective in migraine prophylaxis; however, larger trials are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.",Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,magnesium migraine prevention,1.0,Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,0.9998537302017212
115,2021,35086408,"Pain is one of the most complex and unpleasant sensory and emotional human experiences. Pain relief continues to be a major medical challenge. The application of systemic opioid and regional analgesia techniques has facilitated a decrease in the occurrence and gravity of pain. Magnesium has an evolving role in pain management. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), the pharmacological form of magnesium, is a physiological voltage-dependent blocker of N -methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-coupled channels. In terms of its antinociceptive role, magnesium blocks calcium influx, which inhibits central sensitization and decreases preexisting pain hypersensitivity. These properties have encouraged the research of magnesium as an adjuvant agent for intra- and post-operative analgesia. Moreover, the mentioned magnesium impacts are also detected in patients with neuropathic pain. Intravenous magnesium sulfate, followed by a balanced analgesia, decreases opioid consumption. This review has focussed on the existing evidence concerning the role of magnesium sulfate in pain management in situations including neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, migraine, and post-operative pain.

115,2021,29131326,"Objective: The primary objective was to systematically evaluate the existing evidence base on magnesium in migraine prophylaxis. Methods: The search for clinical trials published from 1990 to 2016 was separately conducted by AvL and FR using standard search terms as well as MeSh terms on PubMed and EMBASE. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating prophylactic magnesium administration in migraineurs aged 18-65 were considered eligible. In a mutual effort, the studies found were sorted and analyzed under consideration of the guidelines for controlled trials for drugs in migraine by the International Headache Society and using predefined eligibility criteria. The resulting clinical trials were jointly analyzed by FR and AvL applying the evidence classification scheme by the American Academy of Neurology and the Cochrane bias tool to assess the evidence-base. In accordance with the guidelines for controlled trials, the number of migraine days and number of migraine attacks were chosen as primary efficacy parameters. The present review was not registered. Results: Out of 204 search results, five clinical trials fulfilling the selection procedure were found. One out of two Class I evidence trials showed a significant reduction of the number of migraine attacks compared with placebo, while two out of three Class III trials evinced a statistically significant reduction of the primary efficacy parameters compared with placebo. Conclusion: This systematic review provides Grade C (possibly effective) evidence for prevention of migraine with magnesium. Prophylactic treatment of migraine by means of high levels of magnesium dicitrate (600 mg) seems to be a safe and cost efficient strategy in clinical use.",Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,magnesium migraine prevention,1.0,Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,0.9994398951530457
116,2021,21323815,"Diet and exercise form the foundation of a healthy lifestyle. These are especially important for people living with diabetes mellitus, as they are the most practical non-pharmacological means by which patients may significantly improve their blood glucose levels. Exercise increases insulin sensitivity (both short and long term), lowers blood sugar levels, reduces body fat and improves cardiovascular (CV) function. Because of this, exercise offers enormous benefit to patients with diabetes. Blood glucose levels can significantly drop during and after physical activities, due to the increased utilisation of glucose as a fuel during exercise and the up-regulation of glucose transport into working muscles. Therefore, patients (especially those with type 1 diabetes) must account for the effects of exercise and adjust their medications and nutrition accordingly. Improvements in real-time continuous glucose monitoring and optimisation of basal insulin dosing may offer significant benefit to preventing hypoglycaemia in patients with type 1 diabetes who regularly exercise. Diverse exercise programmes and devices can also assist patients in monitoring their activities as well as motivating them to achieve their exercise goals. For patients with type 1 diabetes, questions such as how much, how long, how strenuous and what kind of exercise must be addressed in order for healthcare professionals to offer maximum benefit to their patients. Additionally, since patients with type 2 diabetes often have other significant co-morbidities such as obesity and CV disease, care providers must evaluate each patient's risk factors before designing an exercise programme. Several publications in the last year have addressed these issues and may serve as a valuable resource to provide safe and effective recommendations to patients and their healthcare providers. To be included in the Exercise and Diabetes chapter for the 2010 YEARBOOK, we reviewed leading peer-reviewed manuscripts that were published in the period July 2009 to June 2010.

The mechanism of exercise therapy in the improvement of glycolipid metabolism of T2DM is very complex and not completely clear. Summary: Exercise training improves the whole body metabolic health in patients with T2DM, leading to an increase in glycolipid uptake and utilization, improved insulin sensitivity, optimized body mass index, and modulated DNA methylation, etc. Recent findings support that some cytokines such as irisin, osteocalcin, and adiponectin are closely related to exercise and metabolic diseases. This study briefly reviews the physiological mechanisms of exercise therapy in diabetes and the potential role of these cytokines in exercise.

116,2021,3289869,"As more is understood about the physiology of exercise, in both normal and diabetic subjects, its role in the treatment of diabetes is becoming better defined. Whereas people with diabetes may derive many benefits from regular physical exercise, there are also several hazards that make exercise difficult to manage. In type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes, there are risks of hypoglycemia during or after exercise or of worsening metabolic control if insulin deficiency is present. Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients treated with sulfonylureas are also at some increased risk of developing hypoglycemia during or after exercise, although this poses less of a problem than with insulin treatment. In individuals treated by diet alone, regulation of blood glucose during exercise is usually not a significant problem and exercise can be used as an adjunct to diet to achieve weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity. When obese type II diabetic patients are treated with very low calorie diets, adequate amounts of carbohydrate must be provided to ensure maintenance of normal muscle glycogen content, particularly if individuals wish to participate in high-intensity exercise that places a heavy workload on specific muscle groups. On the other hand, moderate-intensity exercise such as vigorous walking can be tolerated by individuals on very low calorie, carbohydrate-restricted diets after an appropriate period of adaptation. A number of strategies can be employed to avoid hypoglycemia in type I diabetic patients, and both type I and II diabetic patients should be examined carefully for long-term complications of their disease, which may be made worse by exercise. These considerations have led many diabetologists to consider exercise beneficial in the management of diabetes for some individuals but not recommended for everyone as a necessary part of diabetes treatment as in the past. The goals should be to teach patients to incorporate exercise into their daily lives if they wish and to develop strategies to avoid the complications of exercise. The rationale for the use of exercise as part of the treatment program in type II diabetes is much more clear than for type I diabetes; regular exercise may be prescribed as an adjunct to caloric restriction for weight reduction and as a means to improve insulin sensitivity in the obese insulin-resistant individual.",Does exercise help manage diabetes?,exercise diabetes,1.0,Does exercise help manage diabetes?,0.5286062955856323

The benefits of exercise for individuals with type 2 diabetes are indisputable. An in-depth understanding of energy metabolism has reasonably entailed exercise as a cornerstone in the lifestyle of almost all subjects with type 1 diabetes. Nevertheless, individuals with type 1 diabetes often fail in accomplishing exercise guidelines and they are less active than their peer without diabetes. Two major obstacles are feared by people with type 1 diabetes who wish to exercise regularly: management of blood glucose control and hypoglycemia. Nowadays, strategies, including glucose monitoring technology and insulin pump therapy, have significantly contributed to the participation in regular physical activity, and even in competitive sports, for people with type 1 diabetes. Novel modalities of training, like different intensity, interspersed exercise, are as well promising. The beneficial potential of exercise in type 1 diabetes is multi-faceted, and it has to be fully exploited because it goes beyond the insulin-mimetic action, possibly through immunomodulation.",Does exercise help manage diabetes?,exercise diabetes,1.0,Does exercise help manage diabetes?,0.9990257024765015
116,2021,29720185,"Background and aims: Exercise training is considered a cornerstone in the management of type 2 diabetes, which is associated with impaired endothelial function. However, the association of exercise training with endothelial function in type 2 diabetes patients has not been fully understood. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate their associations with focus on exercise types. Methods: Databases were searched up to January 2018 for studies evaluating the influences of exercise training with durations ≥ 8 weeks on endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) among type 2 diabetes patients or between type 2 diabetics and non-diabetics. Data were pooled using random-effects models to obtain the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Sixteen databases were included. Exercise training resulted in an overall improvement in FMD by 1.77% (95% CI 0.94-2.59%) in type 2 diabetes patients. Specifically, both aerobic and combined aerobic and resistance exercise increased FMD by 1.21% (95% CI 0.23-2.19%) and 2.49% (95% CI 1.17-3.81%), respectively; but resistance exercise only showed a trend. High-intensity interval aerobic exercise did not significantly improve FMD over moderate-intensity continuous exercise. Notably, the improvement in FMD among type 2 diabetes patients was smaller compared with non-diabetics in response to exercise training (WMD - 0.72%, 95% CI - 1.36 to - 0.08%) or specifically to aerobic exercise (WMD - 0.65%, 95% CI - 1.31 to 0.01%). Conclusions: Exercise training, in particular aerobic and combined exercise, improves endothelial function in type 2 diabetes patients, but such an improvement appears to be weakened compared with non-diabetics.

117,2021,30452697,"This review will explore the observational and mechanistic evidence supporting the hypothesis that fermented milk consumption has beneficial effects on metabolism. Live cultures in fermented dairy are thought to contribute to gut microbial balance, which is likely an instrumental mechanism that protects the host against gut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation associated with cardiometabolic diseases. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) release bioactive metabolites, such as exopolysaccharides and peptides, that have the potential to exert a wide range of metabolic and regulatory functions. In particular, peptides derived from fermented dairy products are likely to exert greater cardiometabolic and anti-inflammatory effects than nonfermented dairy. It is hypothesized that LAB-derived bioactive peptides have the potential to protect the host against cardiometabolic diseases through antimicrobial actions and to effect changes in gene expression of glucose regulatory and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. The peptides released through fermentation may explain some of the health effects of fermented dairy products on cardiometabolic disease risk observed in epidemiological studies, particularly type 2 diabetes; however, mechanisms have yet to be explored in detail.",Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,fermented milk blood pressure,0.0,Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,0.9989975094795227

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored weekly by tail-cuff method. The development of hypertension was significantly attenuated in both groups receiving fermented milk products, whereas skim milk did not affect blood pressure. The effect was detectable after 6 weeks of treatment. At the end of the experiment, the lowest blood pressure level was found in the group receiving fermented milk A: the SBP was 21 mm Hg lower than in the group receiving water and 10 mm Hg lower than in the group receiving fermented milk B.

117,2021,26923047,"Over the past decade, interest has risen in fermented dairy foods that promote health and could prevent diseases such as hypertension. This biological effect has mainly been attributed to bioactive peptides encrypted within dairy proteins that can be released during fermentation with specific lactic acid bacteria or during gastrointestinal digestion.

By inhibiting these processes, ACE inhibitors have antihypertensive effects. Peptides derived from milk proteins can have ACE-inhibiting properties and may thus be used as antihypertensive components. Objective: We evaluated the long-term blood pressure-lowering effect of milk fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus LBK-16H in hypertensive subjects. Design: In a randomized placebo-controlled study, 39 hypertensive patients received 150 mL/d of either L. helveticus LBK-16H fermented milk or a control product for 21 wk after a 2-wk run-in period.

118,2021,29537454,"Dupilumab (Dupixent, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi Genzyme) is a novel biologic medication recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults who have not achieved adequate control with topical medications. Dyshidrotic eczema is a distinct entity, often considered on the spectrum of atopic dermatitis, that primarily effects the palms and soles; it is often associated with considerable morbidity yet is frequently challenging to treat. We report two cases of recalcitrant dyshidrotic eczema treated successfully with dupilumab at standard dosing.

118,2021,28853956,"Purpose: This is a review of emerging targeted, systemic therapies for atopic dermatitis (AD). The information presented aims to provide dermatologists with updated therapeutic options, stimulate academic interest, and spark future research. Material and methods: Extensive search of ClinicalTrials.gov, the National Eczema Association, and PubMed was performed for clinical trials examining the effect of emerging targeted, systemic therapies in patients with AD. Results were included if they demonstrated efficacy in reversing AD symptoms. Studies that did not demonstrate clinical benefit were excluded. Results: A number of emerging systemic agents targeting specific mediators involved in the pathogenesis of AD were found. These targets include IL-4, IL-13, IgE, B-cells, IL-5, IL-31, JAK-STAT, SYK, IL-6, PDE-4, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, IL-22, H4R, NKR1, κOR, TSLP, PPAR-γ, and DGLA. Treatment of AD patients with these therapies has, in many cases, led to statistically significant improvements in clinical severity scores and patient-reported outcomes. Conclusions: While multiple agents have demonstrated efficacy, only dupilumab is currently approved for adults with AD. Large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials, especially in children, are needed. As we enter the dawn of targeted therapy for AD, a comprehensive clinical trial registry is needed to facilitate data pooling and comparison among international registries.",Can dupixent treat eczema?,dupixent eczema,1.0,Can dupixent treat eczema?,0.9611563086509705

118,2021,33393074,"Background: The Harmonising Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) initiative has established a core outcome set of domains for atopic eczema (AE) clinical trials. Previous consensus meetings have agreed on preferred instruments for clinician-reported signs (Eczema Area and Severity Index, EASI) and patient-reported symptoms (Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, POEM). This paper reports consensus decisions from the HOME VII meeting. Objectives: To complete the core outcome set for AE by agreeing on core outcome instruments for the domains of quality of life (QoL), long-term control and itch intensity. Methods: A face-to-face consensus meeting was held in Tokyo, Japan (8-10 April 2019) including 75 participants (49 healthcare professionals/methodologists, 14 patients, 12 industry representatives) from 16 countries. Consensus decisions were made by presentations of evidence, followed by whole and small group discussions and anonymous voting using predefined consensus rules. Results: It was agreed by consensus that QoL should be measured using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) for adults, the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) for children and the Infant's Dermatology Quality of Life Index (IDQoL) for infants. For long-term control, the Recap of Atopic Eczema (RECAP) instrument or the Atopic Dermatitis Control Test (ADCT) should be used. Consensus was not reached over the frequency of data collection for long-term control. The peak itch numerical rating scale (NRS)-11 past 24 h was recommended as an additional instrument for the symptom domain in trials of older children and adults. Agreement was reached that all core outcome instruments should be captured at baseline and at the time of primary outcome assessment as a minimum. Conclusions: For now, the core outcome set for clinical trials in AE is complete. The specified domains and instruments should be used in all new clinical trials and systematic reviews of eczema treatments.",Can dupixent treat eczema?,dupixent eczema,1.0,Can dupixent treat eczema?,0.6670224666595459
118,2021,31693426,"Importance: While dupilumab has emerged as an effective treatment for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) since its approval in 2017, interleukin-4 and 13 blockade has also demonstrated efficacy in off-label chronic dermatologic conditions. Objective: To identify chronic dermatologic conditions in which dupilumab has demonstrated efficacy. Findings: Thirty-three reports of dupilumab use in non-AD dermatologic conditions were identified through systematic literature review. Effective use of dupilumab has been reported in case reports and case series in the treatment of chronic pruritus, prurigo nodularis, eczematous eruption of aging, allergic contact dermatitis, chronic hand eczema, alopecia areata, urticaria, eosinophilic annular erythema, bullous pemphigoid and papuloerythroderma of Ofuji. Clinical trials are underway evaluating the efficacy of dupilumab in allergic contact dermatitis, chronic hand eczema, alopecia areata, chronic spontaneous urticaria and cholinergic urticaria. Conclusions and relevance: Overlap in immune signaling pathways between AD and chronic pruritus, eczematous eruption of aging, allergic contact dermatitis, chronic hand eczema, alopecia areata, urticaria, eosinophilic annular erythema, bullous pemphigoid and papuloerythroderma of Ofuji make these conditions candidates for dupilumab therapy when standard treatments have failed or are contraindicated.

118,2021,32489715,"Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD, eczema) is familial chronic inflammatory skin disease of complex etiology and increasing prevalence. Dupilumab is an IL-4 receptor subunit alpha (IL-4Rα) antagonist that is the first Food and Drug Administration-approved biological therapy for moderate-to-severe adult AD inadequately controlled with topical therapies. Adverse effects reported in the literature include injection site reactions, conjunctivitis, headache, and nasopharyngitis. Objective: We report the first cases of hyperhidrosis and bromhidrosis as side effects from dupilumab (Dupixent®) for the treatment of AD. Case reports: Case 1 is a 20-year-old woman with controlled allergic rhinitis and severe AD reported axillary hyperhidrosis with bromhidrosis, comparable to sweat from high-intensity exercise, with no relief from several different over-the-counter antiperspirants. Case 2 is a 61-year-old woman with history of chronic asthma, allergic contact dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and AD noticed markedly increased sweating with bromhidrosis that was reminiscent of her menopausal symptomology, about 3 months after initiating dupilimab. Discussion: Traditional immunosuppressive agents and corticosteroids have limited efficacy, numerous side effects, and increased risk of infection. The safety profile and efficacy of the newly approved IL-4Rα antagonist dupilumab may be favorable to oral immunosuppressants, but its use remains limited to severe recalcitrant cases, due to financial implications and lack of long-term safety data and comparative head-to-head trials. Conclusion: We report improved outcomes with dupilumab, in addition to unpublished cases of bromhidrosis and hyperhidrosis in 2 patients with AD. This report of additional complications may inspire further clinical research and assist clinicians in considering the option of dupilumab for uncontrolled AD, despite aggressive traditional treatment.",Can dupixent treat eczema?,dupixent eczema,1.0,Can dupixent treat eczema?,0.9988788962364197
118,2021,32007360,"Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, signature type 2 cytokines, exert their actions by binding to two types of receptors sharing the IL-4R α chain (IL-4Rα). Since IL-4 and IL-13 play important and redundant roles in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, blocking both the IL-4 and IL-13 signals would be a powerful and effective strategy for treating allergic diseases. Dupilumab (Dupixent®) is a fully human monoclonal antibody recognizing IL-4Rα and blocking both the IL-4 and IL-13 signals. Dupilumab was first prescribed for atopic dermatitis (AD) patients and has been widely approved for adult patients with moderate to severe AD since 2018. Dupilumab has since been used for asthma, receiving approval for uncontrolled asthma in 2019. A phase 3 study using dupilumab for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) has been just completed, with positive results. Several clinical trials of dupilumab for other diseases in which type 2 inflammation is dominant are now underway. It is hoped that dupilumab will open the door to a new era for treating allergic patients with AD, asthma, and CRSwNP, and for more patients with type 2 inflammations.",Can dupixent treat eczema?,dupixent eczema,1.0,Can dupixent treat eczema?,0.9739372134208679

119,2021,23548052,"Background: While arthritis is the most common cause of disability, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics experience worse arthritis impact despite having the same or lower prevalence of arthritis compared to non-Hispanic whites. People with arthritis who exercise regularly have less pain, more energy, and improved sleep, yet arthritis is one of the most common reasons for limiting physical activity. Mind-body interventions, such as yoga, that teach stress management along with physical activity may be well suited for investigation in both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Yoga users are predominantly white, female, and college educated. There are few studies that examine yoga in minority populations; none address arthritis. This paper presents a study protocol examining the feasibility and acceptability of providing yoga to an urban, minority population with arthritis. Methods/design: In this ongoing pilot study, a convenience sample of 20 minority adults diagnosed with either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis undergo an 8-week program of yoga classes. It is believed that by attending yoga classes designed for patients with arthritis, with racially concordant instructors; acceptability of yoga as an adjunct to standard arthritis treatment and self-care will be enhanced. Self-care is defined as adopting behaviors that improve physical and mental well-being. This concept is quantified through collecting patient-reported outcome measures related to spiritual growth, health responsibility, interpersonal relations, and stress management. Additional measures collected during this study include: physical function, anxiety/depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social roles, and pain; as well as baseline demographic and clinical data. Field notes, quantitative and qualitative data regarding feasibility and acceptability are also collected. Acceptability is determined by response/retention rates, positive qualitative data, and continuing yoga practice after three months. Discussion: There are a number of challenges in recruiting and retaining participants from a community clinic serving minority populations. Adopting behaviors that improve well-being and quality of life include those that integrate mental health (mind) and physical health (body). Few studies have examined offering integrative modalities to this population. This pilot was undertaken to quantify measures of feasibility and acceptability that will be useful when evaluating future plans for expanding the study of yoga in urban, minority populations with arthritis.

Yoga research for arthritis often underrepresents minorities and acceptability for this population has not previously been investigated. Design: Acceptability was evaluated using retention, adherence, journals, and semi-structured exit interviews from twelve participants with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis undergoing an 8-week yoga intervention. Journal quotes were analyzed using content analysis techniques. NVivo software was used to organize transcripts and assemble themes. Two methods of triangulation (data and investigator) were used to overcome potential bias from a single-perspective interpretation. Exit interview comments were content analyzed using a card sort method. The study was designed with a cultural infrastructure including a multicultural research team, translators, and bilingual materials and classes, to facilitate trust and acceptability for primarily Hispanic and Black/African-American adults. Setting: Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, USA. Results: On average participants attended 10 of 16 classes, with home practice 2-3days a week. All who completed were still practicing yoga three-months later. Qualitative narrative analysis identified major themes related to facilitating factors and barriers for yoga practice, self-efficacy, and support. Participant comments indicated that offering an arthritis-based yoga intervention and using a culturally congruent research design was found to be acceptable.

Studies have evaluated yoga to manage symptoms of RA and improve physical function; however, none has examined the relationship between yoga and work status in adults with RA. The objective was to describe differences in RA symptomatology, physical function scores, and work status between adults with RA who participate in yoga and those who do not. This cross-sectional study surveyed adults with rheumatologist-diagnosed RA regarding yoga use in the past year, symptoms, physical function, and work status. Differences between yoga and non-yoga participation groups were assessed with 2-sided t tests or Pearson χ tests. Multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to identify significant associations between yoga participation and primary outcomes. The sample included 398 adults with RA; 88% were females, 66% were white, mean age 61.8 years, mean disease duration 24.8 years; 10.6% participated in yoga. Vinyasa, Bikram, Hatha, Iyengar, and restorative yoga styles were practiced, mostly in a group setting. Yoga participants were significantly more likely to work full-time, less likely to be unable to work due to disability, and had better physical function. These findings characterize yoga practice and practitioners among adults with RA.

119,2021,29484197,"Background: While there is a growing interest in the therapeutic benefits of yoga, minority populations with arthritis tend to be under-represented in the research. Additionally, there is an absence of guidance in the literature regarding the use of multicultural teams and sociocultural health beliefs, when designing yoga studies for a racially diverse population with arthritis. This pilot study examined the feasibility of offering yoga as a self-care modality to an urban, bilingual, minority population with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in the Washington, DC area. Methods: The primary objective of the study was to assess the feasibility of offering an 8-week, bilingual yoga intervention adapted for arthritis to a convenience sample of primarily Hispanic and Black/African-American adults. A racially diverse interdisciplinary research team was assembled to design a study to facilitate recruitment and retention. The second objective identified outcome measures to operationalize potential facilitators and barriers to self-care and self-efficacy. The third objective determined the feasibility of using computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) for data collection. Results: Enrolled participants ( n = 30) were mostly female (93%), Spanish speaking (69%), and diagnosed with RA (88.5%). Feasibility was evaluated using practicality, acceptability, adaptation, and expansion of an arthritis-adapted yoga intervention, modified for this population. Recruitment (51%) and participation (60%) rates were similar to previous research and clinical experience with the study population. Of those enrolled, 18 started the intervention. For adherence, 12 out of 18 (67%) participants completed the intervention. All (100%), who completed the intervention, continued to practice yoga 3 months after completing the study. Using nonparametric tests, selected outcome measures showed a measurable change post-intervention suggesting appropriate use in future studies. An in-person computerized questionnaire was determined to be a feasible method of data collection. Conclusions: Findings from this pilot study confirm the feasibility of offering yoga to this racially/ethnically diverse population with arthritis. This article provides recruitment/retention rates, outcome measures with error rates, and data collection recommendations for a previously under-represented population.

119,2021,26232355,"Background: Research shows high prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in individuals with arthritis. Little is known about CAM use and objectively measured physical functional performance. Objective: The main objective was to determine if CAM use was associated with self-reported symptoms and physical functional performance in adults with arthritis. The secondary objectives were to describe the perceived helpfulness and correlates of CAM use. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from a self-administered questionnaire and objectively measured physical functional performance prior to randomization to a self-paced exercise program or control condition (n = 401). We used the Fisher's exact test, analysis of variance, and general linear models to examine the association of CAM use with socio-demographic characteristics, symptoms and functional performance. Logistic regression computed the odds of perceiving CAM as helpful by level of use. Results: Most respondents had used CAM (76%). Dietary supplements were the most-used (53.1%). Female gender and college education predicted greater number of modalities used. Compared to non-users, use of any CAM was associated with greater fatigue and lower grip strength; relaxation techniques with lower walk distance and gait speed; dietary change with greater pain and stiffness and lower walk distance; and yoga with lower pain and stiffness, greater walk distance, chair stands, seated reach and gait, but lower grip strength.

The review includes demographics/prevalence of yoga as a practice, bibliometric analyses of the yoga publications and the use of yoga for physical fitness and cognitive function. Most of the studies reviewed here involve yoga effects on psychiatric and medical conditions. These include pregnancy, prenatal and postpartum depression; stress, PTSD, anxiety, and obesity; cardiovascular conditions including hypertension; pain syndromes including arthritis, headaches and low back pain; autoimmune conditions including asthma, type II diabetes and multiple sclerosis; immune conditions including HIV and breast cancer; and aging problems including balance, osteoporosis and Parkinson's. The methods and results of those studies are briefly summarized along with their limitations and suggestions for future research. Basically yoga has been more effective than control and waitlist control conditions, although not always more effective than treatment comparison groups such as other forms of exercise. More randomized controlled studies are needed in which yoga is compared to active exercise groups. Having established the physical and mental health benefits of yoga makes it ethically questionable to assign participants to inactive control groups. Shorter sessions should be investigated for cost-effectiveness and for daily practice. Multiple physical and physiological measures need to be added to the self-report research protocols and potential underlying mechanisms need to be further explored.

Drawing on ethnographic observations of pharmaceutical marketing practices at professional headache conferences and a content analysis of migraine advertising, principally in the USA, this paper demonstrates: (1) that the pharmaceutical industry directs its marketing of migraine medication to women; and (2) as part of this strategy, pharmaceutical advertisements portray women as the prototypical migraine sufferer, through representations that elicit hegemonic femininity. This strategy creates the impression that migraine is a ""women's disorder"", which, in turn, exacerbates gender bias in help seeking and diagnosis of migraine and reifies presumptions about the epidemiology of the disorder.

120,2021,27861837,"Background: Though migraine, particularly migraine with aura, is a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor, the scope and distribution of cardiovascular disease in representative samples of people with migraine are not known. This is important because many widely used acute migraine treatments, including triptans, ergot alkaloids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, carry precautions, warnings, or contraindications for use in persons with CV disease. Objectives: To assess the scope and distribution of cardiovascular events, conditions, and procedures in persons with episodic migraine in a representative sample of the US population, using data from the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) Study. Methods: Eligible subjects completed the 2009 AMPP survey, met ICHD-3beta criteria for migraine, and had a headache frequency of less than 15 days per month (episodic migraine). A survey on cardiovascular events (ie, myocardial infarction), conditions (ie, angina), and procedures (ie, carotid endarterectomy) was adopted from the Women's Health Study and the Physician's Health Studies. Cardiovascular events and conditions were defined by participant reports of having both experienced and received a physician diagnosis for a particular event or condition. The distribution of CV events, conditions, and procedures was summarized for the entire migraine sample and in groups defined by gender and age (22-39, 40-59, and ≥60). To assess the numbers of persons with episodic migraine in the US, we applied age and gender stratified estimates of migraine prevalence to the 2015 Census data. To estimate the number of cardiovascular events, conditions, and procedures in the US migraine population, we applied age and gender stratified event rates to the number of persons with episodic migraine in each stratum. Results: The 2009 AMPP Study survey was returned by 11,792 study participants out of 16,983 (64.9% response rate), including 6723 individuals who met study criteria for episodic migraine (5227 women and 1496 men). Among 22-39 year olds with episodic migraine, 3.4% reported having received a physician diagnosis of CV events or conditions and 1.1% reported undergoing CV related procedures. Among 40-59 year olds, 10.2% reported having received a physician diagnosis of CV events or conditions and 3.5% reported CV related procedures. For those age 60 or older, 22.3% reported CV events or conditions and 8.8% reported CV procedures. Prevalence of events, conditions, and procedures was higher in men than women and also in older age groups. However, the absolute number of CV events, procedures, and conditions was greater for women than men due to the higher population prevalence of episodic migraine in women. We projected that 2.0 million women and 665,000 men in the US had episodic migraine and a history of one or more CV event, condition, or procedure. By age group, it is estimated that 579,000 among those aged 22-39, 1.37 million of those aged 40-59, and 696,000 of those 60 and older with episodic migraine have ever had at least one CV event, procedure, or condition. Conclusion: Based on these analyses, we estimate that there are roughly 2.6 million people with episodic migraine aged 22 and older in the US with one or more prior CV event, condition, or procedure.

120,2021,34199479,"The acute treatment of migraine requires effective drugs that are well tolerated and provide rapid and consistent pain relief. Oral tablets are the most commonly used acute treatment for migraine; however, their effectiveness is limited by the rate of gastrointestinal (GI) tract absorption and first-pass hepatic metabolism, and they may not be ideal for patients experiencing GI motility issues. Nasal delivery is an attractive alternative route as it may circumvent GI tract absorption, avoid first-pass metabolism in the liver, and potentially reduce the frequency of GI adverse events. The large surface area and high vascularity within the nose may permit rapid absorption of therapeutics into the systemic circulation, allowing for rapid onset of action. However, the site of drug deposition (upper versus lower nasal cavity) may influence drug pharmacokinetics. Most approved nasal migraine therapies target the lower nasal space where the epithelium is less permeable, and they may be quickly cleared away due to increased ciliary function or dripping from the nose or swallowing, resulting in variable absorption and limited bioavailability. Together with its abundant vascularization, relative mucosal thickness stability, and low clearance rates, the upper nasal space harnesses the benefits of nasal delivery to potentially maximize drug efficacy.",Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,imitrex migraine,1.0,Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,0.9997851252555847
120,2021,21814422,"It is widely recognized that the pharmaceutical industry faces serious financial challenges. Large numbers of blockbuster drugs are losing patent protection and going generic. The pipeline of new drugs is too sparse to fill the gap and generate a platform for future growth. Moreover, many of the new products are biologics with much narrower target patient populations and comparatively higher prices relative to traditional pharmaceuticals. So now the time has come for pharmaceutical scientists to have a better understanding of patent fundamentals. This need is illustrated by analyses of key scientific and legal issues that arose during recent patent infringement cases involving Prozac, Prilosec, and Buspar. Facing this scenario, the pharmaceutical industry has moved to accelerate drug development process and to adopt at the same time different strategies to extend the life time of the patent monopoly to provide the economic incentives and utilizing it for drug discovery and development.

In the clinic, 158 adults with migraine diagnosed according to International Headache Society criteria received SC sumatriptan (6 mg) or placebo delivered with the IMITREX STATdose System for treatment of a migraine attack. By 120 minutes after SC dosing, 73% and 79% of sumatriptan-treated patients, compared with 28% and 37% of placebo-treated patients in studies 1 and 2, respectively, experienced headache relief (a statistically significant difference). Clinical disability scores 120 minutes after dosing showed that 75% and 85% of sumatriptan-treated patients, compared with 30% and 42% of placebo-treated patients, were normal or only mildly impaired (a statistically significant difference). Similar efficacy rates were observed for nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia. No serious or unusual adverse events occurred, and no clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory test values were reported. Based on these results, we concluded that SC sumatriptan (6 mg) administered using the IMITREX STATdose System is effective for the treatment of migraine.

120,2021,22401601,"Background: The features of migraine attacks and the contexts in which migraine attacks occur vary from attack to attack and from patient to patient. Current treatment strategies, which are dominated by the use of oral forms of migraine medication, do not address this patient-to-patient and attack-to-attack heterogeneity. While current therapies, and, in particular, oral triptan tablets can be effective for many types of migraine attacks that a patient can experience, they may not be the optimum treatment for every migraine in every patient. Scope: This clinical review of subcutaneous sumatriptan discusses its characteristics, efficacy, and tolerability and considers its place in clinical practice. The review focuses particularly on several specific clinical settings in which subcutaneous sumatriptan might be a more appropriate therapeutic choice than the oral triptan tablet. Findings: Of the triptan formulations, subcutaneous sumatriptan is the most rapidly absorbed and demonstrates a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Data from randomized, double-blind, clinical trials and studies of patients' perceptions and preferences suggest that subcutaneous sumatriptan can be particularly useful to help restore normal work functioning, for migraine attacks that cannot be treated early in their course, for migraine attacks associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea or vomiting, and for difficult-to-treat migraines, including early-morning migraine and menstrual migraine. The majority of patients (9 in 10) trying subcutaneous sumatriptan indicated that they will use it again. Patients not fully satisfied with previous triptan therapy reported enhanced satisfaction with, and confidence in, treatment after trying subcutaneous sumatriptan. Conclusions: By virtue of their availability as multiple compounds and in multiple formulations including oral, intranasal, and injectable forms, triptans can be used to customize migraine therapy to the individual patient and the individual migraine attack. Due to its route of delivery and favorable pharmacokinetic profile, subcutaneous triptans may represent an attractive alternative for specific clinical settings. Subcutaneous sumatriptan can play a key role in maximizing likelihood of pain-free response and rapid return to normal daily activities and, as such, should be considered an important part of the treatment armamentarium for migraine.",Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,imitrex migraine,1.0,Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,0.9790284037590027

120,2021,15012668,"Objective: To provide medication price data and cost-reducing strategies for the acute treatment of migraine. Methods: Retail prices for common acute care medications were found at http://www.drugstore.com. Cost-reduction tactics were obtained from literature searches and clinical experience. Results: Several strategies can reduce cost without sacrificing treatment outcome. In mild to moderate migraine, low-priced nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used as first-line medications due to their proven efficacy and favorable tolerability. For patients with more severe migraine, implementing a stratified care approach-using migraine-specific medications early in acute treatment-is cost-effective for most patients. Stratified care not only improves outcome and decreases disability, but also reduces cost. Pill splitting and early administration of triptans within an attack enhance their value. Supplying rescue medications, such as opioids, sedatives, and phenothiazines, can prevent emergency department visits. Minimizing multiple dosing of triptans and reducing utilization of expensive health care resources are key factors in reducing the cost of effective migraine treatment. An important affordability factor for patients with co-payments is the number of triptan pills per package. Sumatriptan, naratriptan, and frovatriptan each contain 9 tablets per package, while most other triptan packages contain 6. Current triptan retail prices (per unit) include: Amerge 1 and 2.5 mg, 17.78 dollars; Axert 6.25 and 12.5 mg, 16.31 dollars; Frova 2.5 mg, 13.89 dollars; Imitrex 50 mg, 14.96 dollars; Imitrex 100 mg, 14.41 dollars; Imitrex Nasal Spray 20 mg, 21.61 dollars; Imitrex SQ 6 mg, 50.26 dollars; Maxalt 5 and 10 mg, 15 dollars; Maxalt-MLT 5 and 10 mg, 15 dollars; Relpax 40 mg, 13.58 dollars; Zomig 2.5 mg, 13.67 dollars; Zomig 5 mg, 15.89 dollars; Zomig-ZMT 2.5 mg, 13.67 dollars; and Zomig-ZMT 5 mg, 15.89 dollars.

120,2021,25597782,"Sumatriptan succinate (SS) is a 5-HT1 receptor agonist used in the treatment of migraine having poor bioavailability (15%) due to its extensive first-pass effect. The aim of this work was to prepare SS sublingual fast dissolving thin films (SFDTFs) allowing the drug to directly enter the systemic circulation and bypassing the first-pass metabolism. Plain thin films were prepared using solvent casting technique adopting 2(3) × 3 factorial design to study the effect of polymer and plasticizer type and concentration on mechanical properties and in vitro disintegration time of the plain prepared films using Design-Expert®. Medicated films were prepared after addition of 35 mg SS to each of the two selected plain formulae (F6 and F7) having desirability values above 0.9 showing the values of: 0.038, 0.039 kgf/mm(2) and 156.24, 164.16% and 0.0248, 0.0240 kgf/mm(2) as tensile strength, percent elongation and elastic modulus, respectively.

Episodic attacks can be associated with a number of symptoms, with nausea and/or vomiting being among the most frequent and distressing. Sumatriptan is widely used for acute treatment of migraine and is available in several formulations. The efficacy of oral sumatriptan is well-established. However, patients who experience migraine-associated nausea and/or vomiting can have difficulty swallowing tablets and may delay taking anti-migraine medication. In addition, absorption of oral sumatriptan can be reduced by migraine-associated gastroparesis. Non-oral formulations of sumatriptan are recommended for patients with nausea and/or vomiting, but their use may be limited by adverse effects and patient acceptance.

Despite the fact that light therapy is known to have several advantages over antidepressant drugs like a low cost, minimal side-effects, and fast onset of therapeutic effect, the mechanism underlying light therapy remains unclear. So far, it is known that light therapy modulates mood states and cognitive functions, involving circadian and non-circadian pathways from retinas into brain. In this review, we discuss the therapeutic effect of light on major depression and its relationship to direct retinal projections in the brain.

121,2021,26204994,"Background: Major depression and type 2 diabetes often co-occur. Novel treatment strategies for depression in type 2 diabetes patients are warranted, as depression in type 2 diabetes patients is associated with poor prognosis and treatment results. Major depression and concurrent sleep disorders have been related to disturbances of the biological clock. The biological clock is also involved in regulation of glucose metabolism by modulating peripheral insulin sensitivity. Light therapy has been shown to be an effective antidepressant that 'resets' the biological clock. We here describe the protocol of a study that evaluates the hypothesis that light therapy improves mood as well as insulin sensitivity in patients with a major depressive episode and type 2 diabetes. Methods/design: This study is a randomised, double-blind, parallel-arm trial in 98 participants with type 2 diabetes and a major depressive episode, according to DSM-IV criteria. We will assess whether light therapy improves depressive symptoms and insulin sensitivity, our primary outcome measures, and additionally investigate whether these effects are mediated by restoration of the circadian rhythmicity, as measured by sleep and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Participants will be randomly allocated to a bright white-yellowish light condition or dim green light condition. Participants will undergo light therapy for half an hour every morning for 4 weeks at home. At several time points, namely before the start of light therapy, during light therapy, after completion of 4 weeks of light therapy and after 4 weeks follow-up, several psychometrical, psychophysiological and glucometabolic measures will be performed. Discussion: If light therapy effectively improves mood and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes patients with a major depressive episode, light therapy may be a valuable patient friendly addition to the currently available treatment strategies. Additionally, if our data support the role of restoration of circadian rhythmicity, such an observation may guide further development of chronobiological treatment strategies in this patient population.

Objective: This meta-analysis sought to evaluate the effectiveness of light therapy among older patients with non-seasonal depression. Methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI and CBM from the inception of each database to May 2017. Two researchers conducted the literature screening, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment independently. We used the Cochrane Collaboration's bias assessment tool to evaluate the risk of bias for included studies, and Review Manager 5.2.3 Software for the meta-analysis. Results: Six trials with a total of 359 patients were included, and five studies were assessed as being of low risk for bias. We evaluated the effect of light therapy on depression by the reduction of depressive symptoms (SMD = 0.45; 95% CI= [0.14, 0.75]). The subgroup analysis did not find significant moderating effects of depression with intervention intensity, light type, measuring scale or intervention duration. Limitations: Most of the study samples were not representative of the larger population of adults and therefore caution should be used when interpreting the findings.

While these interventions have robust evidence supporting their efficacy, there remain up to 60 percent of individuals who do not respond to treatment, or only partially respond. Unfortunately, efforts at improving outcome rates from new or modified versions of psychological or pharmacological interventions have been disappointing. It is argued that increased treatment efficacy for depression may be achieved by utilising integrative or adjunctive treatments. As depression is influenced by an array of psychological, biological, social, environmental, dietary, and lifestyle factors, it is hypothesised that treatment outcomes will only be improved when integrative interventions are utilised. The research supporting the potential of several of these factors are reviewed in this article including those associated with diet, exercise, sleep, sunshine/light, nature, herbs and nutraceuticals, social connections, meditation, religion/spirituality, and alcohol and nicotine use.

121,2021,18710579,"Background: Research suggests that depressive disorders exist on a continuum, with subthreshold symptoms causing considerable population burden and increasing individual risk of developing major depressive disorder. An alternative strategy to professional treatment of subthreshold depression is population promotion of effective self-help interventions that can be easily applied by an individual without professional guidance. The evidence for self-help interventions for depressive symptoms is reviewed in the present work, with the aim of identifying promising interventions that could inform future health promotion campaigns or stimulate further research. Methods: A literature search for randomised controlled trials investigating self-help interventions for depressive disorders or depressive symptoms was performed using PubMed, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Reference lists and citations of included studies were also checked. Studies were grouped into those involving participants with depressive disorders or a high level of depressive symptoms, or non-clinically depressed participants not selected for depression. A number of exclusion criteria were applied, including trials with small sample sizes and where the intervention was adjunctive to antidepressants or psychotherapy. Results: The majority of interventions searched had no relevant evidence to review. Of the 38 interventions reviewed, the ones with the best evidence of efficacy in depressive disorders were S-adenosylmethionine, St John's wort, bibliotherapy, computerised interventions, distraction, relaxation training, exercise, pleasant activities, sleep deprivation, and light therapy. A number of other interventions showed promise but had received less research attention. Research in non-clinical samples indicated immediate beneficial effects on depressed mood for distraction, exercise, humour, music, negative air ionisation, and singing; while potential for helpful longer-term effects was found for autogenic training, light therapy, omega 3 fatty acids, pets, and prayer. Many of the trials were poor quality and may not generalize to self-help without professional guidance. Conclusion: A number of self-help interventions have promising evidence for reducing subthreshold depressive symptoms. Other forms of evidence such as expert consensus may be more appropriate for interventions that are not feasible to evaluate in randomised controlled trials. There needs to be evaluation of whether promotion to the public of effective self-help strategies for subthreshold depressive symptoms could delay or prevent onset of depressive illness, reduce functional impairment, and prevent progression to other undesirable outcomes such as harmful use of substances.",Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,light therapy lamp depression,1.0,Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,0.5567823648452759
121,2021,27703764,"Background: Light therapy is a known treatment for patients with seasonal affective disorder. However, the efficacy of light therapy in treating patients with non-seasonal depression remains inconclusive. Aims: To provide the current state of evidence for efficacy of light therapy in non-seasonal depressive disorders. Method: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and CENTRAL from their inception to September 2015. Study selection, data abstraction and risk of bias assessment were independently conducted in duplicate. Meta-analyses were performed to provide a summary statistic for the included RCTs. The reporting of this systematic review follows the PRISMA guidelines. Results: A meta-analysis including 881 participants from 20 RCTs demonstrated a beneficial effect of light therapy in non-seasonal depression (standardised mean difference in depression score -0.41 (95% CI -0.64 to -0.18)). This estimate was associated with significant heterogeneity ( I <sup>2</sup>=60%, P =0.0003) that was not sufficiently explained by subgroup analyses. There was also high risk of bias in the included trials limiting the study interpretation. Conclusions: The overall quality of evidence is poor due to high risk of bias and inconsistency. However, considering that light therapy has minimal side-effects and our meta-analysis demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients achieved a clinically significant response, light therapy may be effective for patients with non-seasonal depression and can be a helpful additional therapeutic intervention for depression.

The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of alexithymia in two different subgroups of children and adolescents suffering from primary headache. We also looked for correlation between alexithymia in children and in their mothers. Methods: This study involved 89 participants: 47 (11 males, 36 females, aged 8 to 17 years) suffering from tension-type headache (TTH), and 42 (18 males, 24 females, aged 8 to 17 years) suffering from migraine (M), based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD 2013). A control group of 32 headache-free subjects (26 females and 6 males, aged 8 to 17 years) was also considered. Two questionnaires were administered to measure alexithymia: the Alexithymia Questionnaire for Children to young patients and controls, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) to the mothers. Results: Higher rates of alexithymia emerged in the TTH group compared to the M group. In particular, TTH sufferers had difficulty identifying their feelings. The mothers of children with headaches didn't score higher in alexithymia compared to other mothers. In the M and in the control group, there was a significant correlation between the rates of alexithymia in young people and in their mothers. Conclusions: To date no other study has investigated alexithymia in subgroups of primary headaches in developmental age. Our results suggest that patients suffering from TTH are more alexithymic than M patients. This pave the way to etiopathogenetic and clinical considerations, calling for a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to tackle the problem of headache.",Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,aleve migraine,0.0,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,0.9705650210380554
122,2021,27215759,"This review proposes a critical discussion of the recent studies investigating the presence of alexithymia in patients suffering from different chronic pain (CP) conditions. The term CP refers to pain that persists or progresses over time, while alexithymia is an affective dysregulation, largely observed in psychosomatic diseases. Overall, the examined studies showed a high prevalence of alexithymia, especially difficulties in identifying feelings, in all the different CP conditions considered. However, the association between alexithymia and pain intensity was not always clear and in some studies this relationship appeared to be mediated by negative effect, especially depression. The role of alexithymia in CP should be clarified by future studies, paying particular attention to two aspects: the use of additional measures, in addition to the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, to assess alexithymia, and the analysis of the potential differences in the evolution of different CP conditions with reference to the presence or absence of alexithymia.",Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,aleve migraine,0.0,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,0.724288284778595
122,2021,6576263,"This study was planned as a pilot study to determine to what extent acupuncture might help in severe cases of migraine and, if possible, to see whether the mechanism was endorphin mediated. The study was carried out on 16 subjects who had severe and regular migraine for more than five years (mean duration 24 years). The study lasted eight months and was divided into four blocks of two months each: pre-treatment, treatment block I, treatment block II, and post-treatment. It was double-blind and cross-over in design. Acupuncture was found to cause a significant change in the number of headaches and their duration, with 40% of the subjects showing a 50%-100% reduction. Although pain sensation was not altered, attacks were less severe and less often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. At no stage was there any difference between subjects receiving saline or naloxone so that the possibility of a non-endorphin mechanism must be considered.",Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,aleve migraine,0.0,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,0.9417735934257507
123,2021,30683113,"Background: Dental caries is a recognized worldwide public health problem. Despite being one of the most effective strategies against dental caries, the excessive use of fluorine may result in a potential risk of developing dental fluorosis especially in children under age of six. The purpose of this work is to analyze a fluorine-free toothpaste containing Biomimetic Hydroxyapatite to assess enamel re-mineralizing and repairing properties. Results: The study was performed in vitro and in vivo, comparing the hydroxyapatite toothpaste with two others toothpaste containing different fluorine concentrations. The coating effect of the micro-structured Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles reintegrates the enamel with a biomimetic film reproducing the structure and the morphology of the biologic Hydroxyapatite of the enamel. As demonstrated, the coating is due to the deposit of a new layer of apatite, which presents fewer particles than the natural enamel, not based on the chemical-physical changes occurring in fluorinated toothpastes. Moreover, it shows resistance to brushing as a consequence of chemical bonds between the synthetic and natural crystals of the enamel. Conclusions: The use of Biomimetic Hydroxyapatite toothpastes has proven to be a valuable prevention measure against dental caries in primary dentition since it prevents the risk of fluorosis.",Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,toothpaste pimple overnight,0.0,Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,0.16653287410736084
123,2021,30211989,"Objectives: The goal of this clinical study was to determine the effects of a dental gel containing 2.6% edathamil on overnight plaque re-accumulation and plaque removal. Methods: In this double-blind, randomized crossover study, 10 subjects first brushed for one week with a washout toothpaste. On the evening of Day 7, prior to tooth brushing, Plaque Index (PI) was recorded, then plaque stained and photographed. Subsequently subjects were randomized to either brush with the test dental gel or the control. After overnight plaque accumulation, PI was recorded. Plaque was stained and photographed before and after subjects brushed with the same toothpaste as the previous night. Subsequently, the process was repeated with the second toothpaste. Image J software was used to quantify plaque presence. Results: Mean increase in PI overnight after brushing (1.78 versus 0.94) and final PI after tooth brushing the next morning (2.20 versus 1.31) were significantly (p 0.05) better after use of the test gel. Tooth surface covered by plaque overnight was significantly higher after using the control gel (22.3%) than the test gel (11.8%; p 0.05). After morning brushing, the residual area of plaque on the teeth was significantly higher for the control gel (9.2%) than for the test gel (3.6%; (p 0.05).

123,2021,27688406,"Objective: The aim of this in vitro preliminary study was to assess the effect of smokers' saliva (assuming their higher calcium concentration) in combination with fluoridated toothpaste on the enamel uptake of alkali-soluble (KOH-soluble) fluoride. Materials and methods: Four enamel slabs were cut from each of 14 impacted third molars and randomly assigned into 4 groups. Unstimulated saliva samples were collected from two age and sex matched volunteers. One of the samples was taken from a heavy smoker and the other sample was taken from a non-smoker. Two groups (A and B) were shaken in saliva (A in smoker's saliva, B in nonsmoker's saliva) for 5 min and then shaken for 3 min in a toothpaste/deionized water slurry (1:3 w/w). One of the groups (group C) received no saliva treatment and was only shaken in toothpaste slurry for 3 min. The treatment was repeated after a 6-hour period. One of the groups (D) served as a control group with no treatment. Results: Calcium concentration in the smoker's saliva was higher than in the nonsmoker's saliva. The enamel uptake of KOH-soluble fluoride in group A was significantly higher than that in the other two treatment groups, B and C. The enamel uptake of KOH-soluble fluoride in all 3 groups was statistically different from that in the control group. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that saliva collected from a heavy smoker, which had higher salivary calcium concentration, enhances enamel uptake of alkali-soluble fluoride and encourages us to conduct a large-scale study.",Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,toothpaste pimple overnight,0.0,Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,0.7587173581123352
123,2021,35397624,"Recent health care products are based on formulations claimed to provide enamel remineralization and dentinal tubules occlusion through calcium-phosphate bioactive nanocompounds (ion-doped hydroxyapatite and precursor, amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles). This study aimed to characterize, test, and compare for the first time the structure and performance of a representative, market-available sample of remineralizing toothpastes and topical mousses. Formulations were characterized to determine their composition and investigate the presence of bioactive compounds and doping elements. A conventional fluoride-containing toothpaste was used as reference. The enamel remineralization and efficacy of dentinal tubules occlusion by tested formulations were investigated ex vivo on human hard tissues. All formulations containing Ca-P bioactive nanocompounds showed remineralizing ability by epitaxial growth of a layer showing the morphology and composition of human hydroxyapatite. Such layers also embedded nanosilica clusters. The presence of doping elements or casein phosphopeptide seemed essential to allow such performances, especially when hydroxyapatite and amorphous calcium phosphate compounds were doped with small amounts of CO 3 <sup>2-</sup>, F<sup>-</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Sr<sup>2+</sup>. Topical mousse formulations showed a higher tubules occlusion capability than toothpastes, independently from their composition.

123,2021,34059302,"Objectives: To investigate the deposition, formation of hydroxyapatite (HAP) and acid resistance of dentine surfaces following brushing with a toothpaste containing calcium silicate and sodium phosphate (CSSP) and fluoride in vitro. Methods: Human dentine specimens were brushed with a slurry of CSSP toothpaste followed by exposure to simulated oral fluid (SOF) in two in vitro studies, with a silica-based non-occluding toothpaste as control. The surface and tubule deposits were analysed after 14 cycles with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). In a third study, dentine specimens were additionally exposed to citric acid erosive challenges for 30, 300 or 600 s after 2, 6, 10 and 14 cycles of SOF and either the CSSP toothpaste or a positive control toothpaste containing calcium sodium phosphosilicate and fluoride. The level of tubule occlusion was evaluated using SEM. Results: The SEM analyses indicated complete coverage of the dentine surface following 14 cycles of brushing with CSSP toothpaste with no observable patent tubules, in contrast to the non-occluding control toothpaste. The TEM and SAED analyses confirmed the deposited material on the surface and within tubules was HAP. The deposited material from CSSP toothpaste was more acid resistant than the deposited material from the positive control toothpaste at all time points and acid exposure levels (p 0.05). Conclusions: The CSSP toothpaste fully occluded dentine tubules and formed the mineral HAP. The dentine deposition on and within dentine tubules was resilient to acid erosive challenges. Clinical significance: A novel toothpaste containing CSSP can form HAP on dentine surfaces and within tubules. The potential of this technology is for a novel approach for the protection of dentine surfaces to acid challenges and the reduction of dentine hypersensitivity.",Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,toothpaste pimple overnight,0.0,Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,0.4301489293575287
123,2021,19301517,"Objective: The objective of this independent, double-blind, overnight clinical study was to assess the efficacy of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan/2.0% polyvinylmethyl ether/maleic acid (PVM/MA) copolymer/0.243% sodium fluoride in a 17% dual silica base (Colgate Total Advanced Toothpaste) for the overnight control of oral malodor and plaque microflora, relative to that of a commercially available dentifrice containing 0.243% sodium fluoride in a silica base (Crest Cavity Protection Toothpaste). Methods: After a five-day period using a supplied commercially available fluoride toothpaste, adult male and female subjects from the Chengdu, China area reported to the clinical facility in the evening, after having refrained from the use of all oral hygiene procedures, as well as eating and drinking, for at least six hours. Following an assessment of the oral soft and hard tissues, subjects were evaluated for baseline oral malodor by a panel of four trained judges using a nine-point hedonic scale. Plaque samples (baseline) from the teeth on the left side of subjects' mouths were also collected. Subjects who presented a mean baseline oral malodor score between 6.0 and 8.4 were stratified according to their oral malodor score and randomly assigned within strata to one of the two treatment groups. Subjects were provided with their assigned dentifrice and instructed to brush their teeth on the left side of their mouth only, for one minute under supervision. Subjects returned to the testing facility the following morning for an overnight evaluation, having refrained from the use of all oral hygiene procedures, and from eating and drinking. An oral malodor assessment was performed, plaque samples were collected from the teeth on the right side of the mouth, and a final oral soft and hard tissue evaluation was performed. Results: Eighty-one (81) subjects completed the study. At the overnight evaluation, subjects in the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group and the fluoride dentifrice group presented mean oral malodor scores of 4.91 and 6.86, respectively. Relative to the fluoride dentifrice group, at the overnight evaluation the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group presented a statistically significant 28.4% reduction in oral malodor scores. Additionally, at the overnight evaluation, subjects in the triclosan/ copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group and the fluoride dentifrice group presented geometric mean microbial colony forming unit (CFU) scores of 3.15 and 6.07, respectively. Relative to the fluoride dentifrice group, at the overnight evaluation the triclosan/copolymer/ fluoride dentifrice group presented a statistically significant 49.5% reduction in microbial CFU scores. Conclusion: The overall results of this double-blind clinical study support the conclusion that a single evening's use of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan/2.0% PVM/MA copolymer/0.243% sodium fluoride in a 17% dual silica base provides statistically significantly lower levels of overnight (12-hour) oral malodor and plaque microflora when compared to a commercially available dentifrice containing 0.243% sodium fluoride in a silica base.",Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,toothpaste pimple overnight,0.0,Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,0.3333721458911896
123,2021,28530007,"Purpose: To evaluate the effect of CPP-ACPF paste and fluoride toothpastes on enamel subjected to erosion and erosion plus abrasion in vitro. Materials and methods: A total of 220 human enamel blocks were divided into eleven groups (n = 20): CPP-ACPF paste (MPP), potassium nitrate/sodium fluoride toothpaste (PE), sodium fluoride toothpaste (FD), fluoride-free toothpaste (SO) and control (erosion only with no paste or toothpastes; CO) according to the experimental design: erosion or erosion plus abrasion immediately after erosion (ERO+I-ABR) or 30 min after erosion (ERO+30min-ABR). For 5 days, the specimens were subjected to: (1) erosive challenge (EC) (cola drink, 4 x 5 min/day), topical application of the undiluted paste or diluted toothpastes (1:2 w/w) (4 x 1 min/ day) plus 1 h in artificial saliva (AS) between cycles and overnight; or (2) EC plus abrasion (4 x /60 s/day) performed with the diluted toothpastes (no MMP) plus 1 h in AS between cycles and overnight. Erosion depth was quantified through a 3D profilometer. Data were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests (p = 0.05). Results: CPP-ACPF paste and NaF toothpaste showed lowest enamel wear among groups and reduced tissue loss by 89% in erosion challenge. Abrasion led to higher enamel wear than erosion only (p = 0.030). ERO+30min-ABR had no protective effect when compared to ERO+I-ABR (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: A high frequency of CPP-ACPF paste application (4x daily) is effective in reducing the effects of erosion.

Individual preventive measures are not adequate enough to control the disease especially in children with high caries experience The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of tooth paste containing enzymes and proteins in inhibiting plaque re-growth when compared to fluoride tooth paste in children with high caries experience. Material and methods: A total of 15 plaque samples are collected from 15 subjects in the age group of 5-7 years with High caries experience. The participants were asked to fast overnight for 12 h. On the day of the study, the participants were asked to report without brushing. Pre brushing pooled plaque was collected from buccal and palatal/lingual surfaces of maxillary and mandibular teeth and transferred to chilled Eppendorf tubes. Samples were divided into two groups; according to the test toothpaste used; Zendium toothpaste and Colgate cavity protection along with controls. Inhibition of plaque re-growth is assessed by comparing optical density using a spectrophotometer at intervals between 0-8 hours. Results: Results demonstrated that toothpaste containing enzymes and proteins can significantly inhibit plaque growth when compared to normal toothpaste ( p 0.05) in children with high caries experience.

123,2021,35075780,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect influence of fluoridated toothpastes and fluoride-free toothpaste with hydroxyapatite (HAP) as active ingredient on initial bacterial colonization on enamel in situ. Methods: For this clinical-experimental pilot study, eight subjects were instructed to brush their teeth with three different toothpastes (Elmex<sup>®</sup> : 1400 ppm AmF, Meridol<sup>®</sup> : 1400 ppm AmF +SnF2, Karex<sup>®</sup> : HAP), using each for two consecutive days. As a control, brushing without toothpaste was performed. To evaluate bacterial colonization, subject wore splints with buccally placed bovine enamel platelets overnight. Two modes were tested. In a first pass (regimen A), the splints were inserted after toothbrushing to examine the indirect effects of the dentifrices. In order to investigate the direct effects, the specimens were brushed in situ in a second pass (regimen B). Biofilm formation was visualized and quantified using fluorescence microscopy (DAPI and BacLight) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: For brushing regimen A (indirect effect of dentifrices), no statistical differences were detected between any of the tested dentifrices or the control. Likewise, no statistically significant differences were recorded for brushing regimen B (direct effect of dentifrices). Furthermore, no differences between the different brushing techniques were determined with regard to the ultrastructure of the overnight biofilm. Conclusion: Within the limitations of the present pilot study, it can be concluded that in patients with good oral hygiene, dentifrices and their chemical composition have no statistically significant effect on the initial bacterial colonization of enamel platelets in situ, irrespectively of the mode of application.",Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,toothpaste pimple overnight,0.0,Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,0.22204972803592682
123,2021,29263431,"Toothpastes have a complex formulation and their different chemical and physical factors will influence their effectiveness against erosive tooth wear (ETW). We, therefore, investigated the effect of different desensitizing and/or anti-erosive toothpastes on initial enamel erosion and abrasion, and analysed how the interplay of their chemical and physical factors influences ETW. Human enamel specimens were submitted to 5 erosion-abrasion cycles using 9 different toothpastes and an artificial saliva group, and enamel surface loss (SL) was calculated. Chemical and physical factors (pH; presence of tin; calcium, phosphate and fluoride concentrations; % weight of solid particles; wettability; and particle size) of the toothpaste slurries were then analysed and associated with the amount of SL in a multivariate model. We observed that all desensitizing and/or anti-erosive toothpastes presented different degrees of SL. Besides pH and fluoride, all other chemical and physical factors were associated with SL. The results of this experiment indicate that enamel SL occurs independent of whether the toothpastes have a desensitizing or anti-erosive claim, and that lower SL is associated with the presence of tin, higher concentration of calcium and phosphate, higher % weight of solid particles, smaller particle size, and lower wettability.",Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,toothpaste pimple overnight,0.0,Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,0.04764989763498306
124,2021,25629804,"Background: Osteoarthritis, a common joint disorder, is one of the leading causes of disability. Chondroitin has emerged as a new treatment. Previous meta-analyses have shown contradictory results on the efficacy of chondroitin. This, in addition to the publication of more trials, necessitates a systematic review. Objectives: To evaluate the benefit and harm of oral chondroitin for treating osteoarthritis compared with placebo or a comparator oral medication including, but not limited to, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, opioids, and glucosamine or other ""herbal"" medications. Search methods: We searched seven databases up to November 2013, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Science Citation Index (Web of Science) and Current Controlled Trials. We searched the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) websites for adverse effects. Trial registers were not searched. Selection criteria: All randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials lasting longer than two weeks, studying adults with osteoarthritis in any joint, and comparing chondroitin with placebo, an active control such as NSAIDs, or other ""herbal"" supplements such as glucosamine. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently performed all title assessments, data extractions, and risk of bias assessments. Main results: Forty-three randomized controlled trials including 4,962 participants treated with chondroitin and 4,148 participants given placebo or another control were included. The majority of trials were in knee OA, with few in hip and hand OA. Trial duration varied from 1 month to 3 years. Participants treated with chondroitin achieved statistically significantly and clinically meaningful better pain scores (0-100) in studies less than 6 months than those given placebo with an absolute risk difference of 10% lower (95% confidence interval (CI), 15% to 6% lower; number needed to treat (NNT) = 5 (95% CI, 3 to 8; n = 8 trials) (level of evidence, low; risk of bias, high); but there was high heterogeneity between the trials (T(2) = 0.07; I(2) = 70%, which was not easily explained by differences in risk of bias or study sample size). In studies longer than 6 months, the absolute risk difference for pain was 9% lower (95% CI 18% lower to 0%); n = 6 trials; T(2) = 0.18; I(2) = 83% ), again with low level of evidence.For the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Minimal Clinically Important Improvement (WOMAC MCII Pain subscale) outcome, a reduction in knee pain by 20% was achieved by 53/100 in the chondroitin group versus 47/100 in the placebo group, an absolute risk difference of 6% (95% CI 1% to 11%), (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24; T(2) = 0.00; I(2) = 0%) (n = 2 trials, 1253 participants; level of evidence, high; risk of bias, low).Differences in Lequesne's index (composite of pain,function and disability) statistically significantly favoured chondroitin as compared with placebo in studies under six months, with an absolute risk difference of 8% lower (95% CI 12% to 5% lower; T(2)= 0.78; n = 7 trials) (level of evidence, moderate; risk of bias, unclear), also clinically meaningful. Loss of minimum joint space width in the chondroitin group was statistically significantly less than in the placebo group, with a relative risk difference of 4.7% less (95% CI 1.6% to 7.8% less; n = 2 trials) (level of evidence, high; risk of bias, low). Chondroitin was associated with statistically significantly lower odds of serious adverse events compared with placebo with Peto odds ratio of 0.40 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.82; n = 6 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Chondroitin did not result in statistically significant numbers of adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events compared with placebo or another drug. Adverse events were reported in a limited fashion, with some studies providing data and others not.Comparisons of chondroitin taken alone or in combination with glucosamine or another supplement showed a statistically significant reduction in pain (0-100) when compared with placebo or an active control, with an absolute risk difference of 10% lower (95% CI 14% to 5% lower); NNT = 4 (95% CI 3 to 6); T(2) = 0.33; I(2) = 91%; n = 17 trials) (level of evidence, low). For physical function, chondroitin in combination with glucosamine or another supplement showed no statistically significant difference from placebo or an active control, with an absolute risk difference of 1% lower (95% CI 6% lower to 3% higher with T(2) = 0.04; n = 5 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Differences in Lequesne's index statistically significantly favoured chondroitin as compared with placebo, with an absolute risk difference of 8% lower (95% CI, 12% to 4% lower; T(2) = 0.12; n = 10 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Chondroitin in combination with glucosamine did not result in statistically significant differences in the numbers of adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, or in the numbers of serious adverse events compared with placebo or with an active control.The beneficial effects of chondroitin in pain and Lequesne's index persisted when evidence was limited to studies with adequate blinding or studies that used appropriate intention to treat (ITT) analyses. These beneficial effects were uncertain when we limited data to studies with appropriate allocation concealment or a large study sample (&gt; 200) or to studies without pharmaceutical funding. Authors' conclusions: A review of randomized trials of mostly low quality reveals that chondroitin (alone or in combination with glucosamine) was better than placebo in improving pain in participants with osteoarthritis in short-term studies. The benefit was small to moderate with an 8 point greater improvement in pain (range 0 to 100) and a 2 point greater improvement in Lequesne's index (range 0 to 24), both seeming clinically meaningful. These differences persisted in some sensitivity analyses and not others. Chondroitin had a lower risk of serious adverse events compared with control. More high-quality studies are needed to explore the role of chondroitin in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The combination of some efficacy and low risk associated with chondroitin may explain its popularity among patients as an over-the-counter supplement.",Can chondroitin help relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,"

124,2021,28155831,"Chondroitin is an organic compound, belonging to the group of glycosaminoglycans. In the treatment of degenerative joint disease, aka osteoarthritis, chondroitin sulphate is applied as a medicine or a dietary supplement. The biological importance of chondroitin sulphate has been already largely determined. The newest data on glycobiology research suggest that proteoglycans, as well as their complex polysaccharide macroparticles not only are the structural elements, but also they participate in multiple metabolic processes at a molecular level as well as in the physiological processes, regulating this type of mechanisms. The preparations applied in the treatment of degenerative joint disease, containing chondroitin sulphate, are attributed numerous therapeutic and chondroprotective properties including stabilizing synthesis processes and cartilage degradation through stimulation and inhibition of chondrocyte apoptosis (production of the elements of the intracellular substance and osteocyte stimulation), an increased proteoglycan and hyaluronic acid biosynthesis, inhibition of the activity of proteolytic enzymes and hyaluronidase, reduction of inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins and leukotrienes) and a decreased collagen II degradation.

124,2021,30859538,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disorder involving the deterioration of articular cartilage and underlying bone and is associated with symptoms of pain and disability. In military personnel, the incidence of OA has increased between 2000 and 2012 and was the first or second leading cause of medical separations in this period. It has been suggested that consumption of chondroitin sulfate (CS) may reduce the pain and joint deterioration associated with OA. This article reports on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of CS on reducing OA-related pain and joint deterioration. PubMed and Ovid Embase databases and other sources were searched to find randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on the effects of orally consumed CS on pain and/or joint structure. The outcome measure was the standardized mean difference (SMD) which was the improvement in the placebo groups minus the improvement in the CS groups divided by the pooled standard deviation. There were 18 trials meeting the review criteria for pain with SMD -0.41, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.57 to -0.25 (negative SMD favors CS). Six studies met the review criteria for joint space narrowing with SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.61 to +0.00. Two studies meet the review criteria for cartilage volume with SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.48 to +0.26. Larger dosages (1200mg/d) had greater pain reduction efficacy than lower dosages (≤ 1000mg/d). These data suggest that CS has small to moderate effectiveness in reducing OA-related pain but minimal effects on joint space narrowing and no effect on cartilage volume. It is important that clinicians recommend pharmaceutical-grade CS to their patients due to the variability in the amount of CS in dietary supplements purporting to contain CS.",Can chondroitin help relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,"

124,2021,24815409,"Oral supplementation of chondroitin sulphate plus glucosamine helps repair the articular surface in osteoarthritis. Chondroitin-S reduces the concentration of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factor involved in inflammation. GlcN.S enhances cartilage specific matrix components and prevents collagen degeneration in chondrocytes by inhibiting hydrolytic enzymes, and preventing the oxidation of lipids and proteins. Chondroitin-S plus GlcN.S are slow-acting drugs that alleviate pain and partly restore joint function in OA patients. Orally administered pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin-S plus GlcN.S stabilize the joint space narrowing and significantly decrease the number of patients with new erosive OA. They are safe and no adverse events have ever been reported; they are recommended by EULAR and OARSI. The cost/effectiveness of the oral chondroitin-S plus GlcN.S therapy derives from the reduction of costs for physiotherapy, and for gastroprotective and non-steroidal drugs. The synergistic association of these two world-widely preferred nutraceuticals is a step forward in the management of OA.",Can chondroitin help relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,"

124,2021,34622845,"Background: Hyaluronan (HA), glucosamine, and chondroitin sulfate are widely consumed as dietary supplements for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA). This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of a dietary liquid supplement mixture containing HA, glucosamine, and chondroitin in patients with knee OA who had moderate knee pain (visual analogue scale of 4-6 points). Methods: This was a short-term, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects were allocated to administer either a bottle of 20 mL supplement mixture (50 mg HA plus 750 mg glucosamine plus 250 mg chondroitin, namely A + HA) or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. Outcome measures included the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36), Chinese version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and incidence of adverse event were evaluated at the end of week 8. Efficacy analyses were conducted in the modified intent-to-treat population. Results: Of the 80 subjects in the modified intent-to-treat population, 39 received A + HA while 41 received placebo. After 8 weeks of treatment, the A + HA group failed to demonstrate a significant symptomatic efficacy and quality of life improvement in terms of Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, SF-36, and Chinese version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index as compared to the placebo group. However, the mean changes in most of the SF-36 scale scores were numerically higher in the A + HA group than in the placebo group. No treatment-related adverse event was reported in both groups. Conclusions: This present study found that the combination of liquid low molecular weight HA, glucosamine, and chondroitin oral supplement did not effectively improve knee OA pain and symptoms after short-term use in knee OA patients with moderate knee pain. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the intrinsic limitation of the study design.",Can chondroitin help relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,"

124,2021,27845067,"Osteoarthritis is the most common chronic joint disorder especially during aging. Although with controversies, glucosamine, both in its forms of sulfate and hydrochloride, and chondroitin sulfate are commonly employed to treat osteoarthritis. Due to the modest improve in the symptoms observed in patients treated with these drugs alone, a formulation combining both agents has been considered. The discrepant results achieved for pain control or structural improvement in osteoarthritis patients has been attributed to the quality of chemical formulations or different bias in clinical studies. The current study has been designed to test the effects of two different combined formulations with adequate pharmaceutical grade of these drugs in osteoarthritic joints, and to explore the underlying mechanisms modulated by both formulations in different osteoarthritis target tissues. Knee osteoarthritis was surgically induced in experimental rabbits. Some animals received the combined therapy (CT)1, (chondroitin sulfate 1200mg/day + glucosamine sulfate 1500mg/day), or the CT2 ((chondroitin sulfate 1200mg/day + glucosamine hydrochloride 1500mg/day). Neither CT1 nor CT2 significantly modified the cartilage damage or the synovial inflammation observed in osteoarthritic animals. Treatments were also unable to modify the presence of pro-inflammatory mediators, and the synthesis of metalloproteinases in the cartilage or in the synovium of osteoarthritic animals. Combined therapies did not modify the decrease in the subchondral bone mineral density observed in osteoarthritic rabbits. Therapies of chondroitin sulfate plus glucosamine sulfate or chondroitin sulfate plus glucosamine hydrochloride failed to improve structural damage or to ameliorate the inflammatory profile of joint tissues during experimental osteoarthritis.",Can chondroitin help relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,"

124,2021,23186102,"Objectives: Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease characterized by irreversible damage to joint structures, including loss of articular cartilage, osteophyte formation, alterations in the subchondral bone and synovial inflammation. It has been shown that chondroitin sulfate interferes with the progression of structural changes in joint tissues and is used in the management of patients with osteoarthritis. Methods: This review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the mechanisms of action of chondroitin sulfate that may explain the beneficial effects of the drug and examines the evidence for clinical efficacy of oral chondroitin sulfate in osteoarthritis. Data included in the review were derived from a literature search in PubMed. Literature searches were performed in PubMed using the search terms 'chondroitin sulfate', 'pharmaceutical-grade', 'osteoarthritis', 'randomized clinical trials', 'humans'. The MEDLINE database was searched from January 1996 through August 2012 for all randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and review articles of chondroitin sulfate in osteoarthritis. Results: Chondroitin sulfate exerts in vitro a beneficial effect on the metabolism of different cell lines: chondrocytes, synoviocytes and cells from subchondral bone, all involved in osteoarthritis. It increases type II collagen and proteoglycan synthesis in human articular chondrocytes and is able to reduce the production of some pro-inflammatory factors and proteases, to reduce the cellular death process, and improve the anabolic/catabolic balance of the extracellular cartilage matrix (ECM). Clinical trials have reported a beneficial effect of chondroitin sulfate on pain and function. The structure-modifying effects of chondroitin sulfate have been reported and analyzed in recent meta-analyses. The results in knee osteoarthritis demonstrate a small but significant reduction in the rate of decline in joint space width. Because chondroitin sulfate quality of several nutraceuticals has been found to be poor, it is recommended that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate is used rather than food supplements in the treatment of OA. Chondroitin sulfate is recommended by several guidelines from international societies in the management of knee and hip OA. Furthermore, its safety profile is favorable when compared with many other therapies used in OA. Conclusion: Chondroitin sulfate is an effective and safe treatment option for patients with osteoarthritis.",Can chondroitin help relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,"

124,2021,28657529,"Background/aims: Osteoarthritis (OA), the commonest joint disorder, is a leading cause of disability. Symptomatic slow-acting drugs for OA (SYSADOA), particularly glucosamine plus chondroitin sulphate (GS/CS), are effective for symptom relief, protect joint cartilage and delay OA progression, with a good safety profile. D-002, a mixture of beeswax alcohols that inhibits both cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase activities, has been effective in experimental and clinical OA studies, showing also a chondroprotective effect. Objectives: To compare the effects of D-002 and GS/SC administered for 12 weeks on OA symptoms. Methods: Participants were randomized to GS/CS (375/300 mg) or 50 mg D-002 once daily for 12 weeks. Symptoms were assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Individual Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Visual Analogy Scale (VAS) scores. The primary outcome was the reduction of the total WOMAC score. Secondary outcomes included WOMAC pain, stiffness and function scores, VAS score and rescue medication consumption. Results: Of 60 randomized patients, 59 completed the study. D-002 and GS/SC reduced significantly total WOMAC score (72.1% and 78.5%, respectively), and pain, joint stiffness and physical function scores versus baseline. VAS scores decreased significantly with D-002 (76.6%) and GS/SC (76.8%). The reductions, significant from the second week, were enhanced over the trial. Rescue medications were consumed by 3/30 D-002 and 4/30 GS/SC patients. No differences between groups were found. Treatments were well tolerated. Conclusions: D-002 (50 mg/day) administered for 12 weeks was safe and comparable to GS/SC for alleviating OA symptoms (pain, stiffness, and functional limitation) (RPCEC00000180).",Can chondroitin help relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,"

125,2021,31271554,"Background The beneficial effects of treating hypertriglyceridemic adults with omega-3 fatty acids have been reported. However, information regarding omega-3 treatment of pediatric patients is limited. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of administering omega-3 fatty acids (3 g/day for 12 weeks) to children/adolescents with obesity and hypertriglyceridemia. Methods A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study involving pediatric patients (10-16 years old) with obesity and hypertriglyceridemia was conducted. The National Center for Health Statistics (CDC) defines obesity as a body mass index (BMI) ≥95th percentile. Subjects with triglyceride concentrations ranging from 150 to 1000 mg/dL were randomized into two groups: those receiving omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids) (n = 65) and those receiving a placebo (n = 65) for 12 weeks. Serum triglyceride concentrations were always measured from 8 to 9 am after a 12-h fast. Results By the end of treatment, triglyceride concentrations had decreased by 39.1% in the omega-3 group and 14.6% in the placebo group (p 0.01). The incidence of adverse gastrointestinal events (e.g. flatulence, belching) was 41.2% and 6.2% in the omega-3 and placebo groups, respectively (p 0.01). There were no serious drug-related adverse events.

125,2021,31237134,"Background: Cardiovascular risk remains increased despite optimal low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level induced by intensive statin therapy. Therefore, recent guidelines recommend non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) as a secondary target for preventing cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of omega-3 fatty acids (OM3-FAs) in combination with atorvastatin compared to atorvastatin alone in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, and phase III multicenter study included adults with fasting triglyceride (TG) levels ≥200 and 500 mg/dL and LDL-C levels 110 mg/dL. Eligible subjects were randomized to ATOMEGA (OM3-FAs 4,000 mg plus atorvastatin calcium 20 mg) or atorvastatin 20 mg plus placebo groups. The primary efficacy endpoints were the percent changes in TG and non-HDL-C levels from baseline at the end of treatment. Results: After 8 weeks of treatment, the percent changes from baseline in TG (-29.8% vs. 3.6%, P 0.001) and non-HDL-C (-10.1% vs. 4.9%, P 0.001) levels were significantly greater in the ATOMEGA group ( n =97) than in the atorvastatin group ( n =103). Moreover, the proportion of total subjects reaching TG target of 200 mg/dL in the ATOMEGA group was significantly higher than that in the atorvastatin group (62.9% vs. 22.3%, P 0.001). The incidence of adverse events did not differ between the two groups.

125,2021,27444154,"Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides &gt; 150 mg/dL) affects ~25 % of the United States (US) population and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) is also a risk factor for pancreatitis. Three omega-3 fatty acid (OM3FA) prescription formulations are approved in the US for the treatment of adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia: (1) OM3FA ethyl esters (OM3EE), a mixture of OM3FA ethyl esters, primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (Lovaza®, Omtryg™, and generics); (2) icosapent ethyl (IPE), EPA ethyl esters (Vascepa®); and (3) omega-3 carboxylic acids (OM3CA), a mixture of OM3FAs in free fatty acid form, primarily EPA, DHA, and docosapentaenoic acid (Epanova®). At approved doses, all formulations substantially reduce triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein levels. DHA-containing formulations may also increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, this is not accompanied by increased non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which is thought to provide a better indication of cardiovascular risk in this patient population. Proposed mechanisms of action of OM3FAs include inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase, increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity, decreased hepatic lipogenesis, and increased hepatic β-oxidation. OM3CA bioavailability (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to the last measurable concentration) is up to 4-fold greater than that of OM3FA ethyl esters, and unlike ethyl esters, the absorption of OM3CA is not dependent on pancreatic lipase hydrolysis. All three formulations are well tolerated (the most common adverse events are gastrointestinal) and demonstrate a lack of drug-drug interactions with other lipid-lowering drugs, such as statins and fibrates.

Data sources: Two independent reviewers examined all RCTs from 1994 to 2003 identified in several databases, extracted data from each study, and used the previously tested Boyack and Lookinland Methodological Quality Index (MQI) to determine study quality. Conclusions: Ten studies reported long-chain omega-3 fatty acids to be effective in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. The average decrease in triglycerides was 29%, total cholesterol 11.6%, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) 30.2%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 32.5%. One study found LDLs to increase by 25%. The average increase in high-density lipoprotein was 10%. The overall average MQI score was 36% (range = 26% to 54%). Many of the RCTs had serious shortcomings, including short duration, lack of a power analysis, no intention-to-treat analysis, no report of blind assessment of outcome, and lack of dietary control as a confounding variable. Implications for practice: Overall study methodology was weak. Although the evidence supporting use of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in the secondary prevention of hypertriglyceridemia is reasonably strong, until there are larger RCTs of better methodological quality, it is not recommended that practitioners treat hypertriglyceridemia with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in lieu of lipid-lowering medications.",Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,omega-3 fatty acids hypertriglyceridemia,1.0,Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,0.004057961516082287

125,2021,2000816,"The hypotriglyceridemic action of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids is attributed primarily to reduction in hepatic triglyceride synthesis and reduced secretion of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs). However, increased catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins was reported and could be due to increased availability of peripheral lipoprotein lipase (LPL) or hepatic lipase (HL). In this study plasma lipoproteins and postheparin activities of LPL and HL were determined in 12 patients with primary hypertriglyceridemia before and during isocaloric substitution of omega-3 fatty acids (10 g/d) for 4 wk. Omega-3 polyunsaturates resulted in 53% and 61% reductions in plasma triglyceride and VLDL-cholesterol concentrations, respectively (P less than 0.0001).

A low-fat diet may reduce pancreatic lipase secretion, which is required to absorb OM3-ethyl esters (OM3-EEs), but not OM3-carboxylic acids (OM3-CAs). Methods: In this exploratory, randomized, open-label, crossover study, 15 patients with SHTG and previous AP were instructed to take OM3-CA (2 g or 4 g) and OM3-EE 4 g once daily for 4 weeks, while adhering to a low-fat diet. On day 28 of each treatment phase, a single dose was administered in the clinic with a liquid low-fat meal, to assess 24-h plasma exposure. Geometric least-squares mean ratios were used for between-treatment comparisons of baseline (day 0)-adjusted area under the plasma concentration versus time curves (AUC 0-24 ) and maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Results: Before initiating OM3-FA treatment, mean baseline fasting plasma EPA + DHA concentrations (nmol/mL) were 723 for OM3-CA 2 g, 465 for OM3-CA 4 g and 522 for OM3-EE 4 g. At week 4, mean pre-dose fasting plasma EPA + DHA concentrations increased by similar amounts (+ 735 - + 768 nmol/mL) for each treatment. During the 24-h exposure assessment (day 28), mean plasma EPA + DHA increased from pre-dose to the maximum achieved concentration by + 32.7%, + 45.8% and + 3.1% with single doses of OM3-CA 2 g, OM3-CA 4 g and OM3-EE 4 g, respectively. Baseline-adjusted AUC 0-24 was 60% higher for OM3-CA 4 g than for OM3-EE 4 g and baseline-adjusted C max was 94% higher (both non-significant). Conclusions: Greater 24-h exposure of OM3-CA versus OM3-EE was observed for some parameters when administered with a low-fat meal at the clinic on day 28. However, increases in pre-dose fasting plasma EPA + DHA over the preceding 4-week dosing period were similar between treatments, leading overall to non-significant differences in baseline (day 0)-adjusted AUC 0-24 and C max EPA + DHA values. It is not clear why the greater 24-h exposure of OM3-CA versus OM3-EE observed with a low-fat meal did not translate into significantly higher pre-dose fasting levels of DHA + EPA with longer-term use.

Even though the previous version of our review showed benefits of probiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), several new studies have been published. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose), compared with placebo, in the prevention of acute URTIs in people of all ages, who are at risk of acute URTIs. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to July week 3, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to July 2014), Web of Science (1900 to July 2014), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, which includes the China Biological Medicine Database (from 1978 to July 2014), the Chinese Medicine Popular Science Literature Database (from 2000 to July 2014) and the Masters Degree Dissertation of Beijing Union Medical College Database (from 1981 to July 2014).

Main results: We included 13 RCTs, although we could only extract data to meta-analyze 12 trials, which involved 3720 participants including children, adults (aged around 40 years) and older people. We found that probiotics were better than placebo when measuring the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTI [at least one episode: odds ratio (OR): 0.53; 95% CI = 0.37-0.76, P .001, low quality evidence; at least three episodes: OR: 0.53; 95% CI = 0.36-0.80, P = .002, low quality evidence]; the mean duration of an episode of acute URTI [mean difference (MD): -1.89; 95% CI = -2.03 to -1.75, P .001, low quality evidence]; reduced antibiotic prescription rates for acute URTIs (OR: 0.65; 95% CI = 0.45-0.94, moderate quality evidence) and cold-related school absence (OR: 0.10; 95% CI = 0.02-0.47, very low quality evidence). Probiotics and placebo were similar when measuring the rate ratio of episodes of acute URTI (rate ratio: 0.83; 95% CI = 0.66-1.05, P = .12, very low quality evidence) and adverse events (OR: 0.88; 95% CI = 0.65-1.19, P = .40, low quality evidence). Side effects of probiotics were minor and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common. We found that some subgroups had a high level of heterogeneity when we conducted pooled analyses and the evidence level was low or very low quality. Authors' conclusions: Probiotics were better than placebo in reducing the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTI, the mean duration of an episode of acute URTI, antibiotic use and cold-related school absence.

In three of nine RCTs that provided relevant data, the clinical course of RTIs was shorter in the probiotic arm, whereas no difference was found in the remaining six RCTs. In conclusion, probiotics may have a beneficial effect on the severity and duration of symptoms of RTIs but do not appear to reduce the incidence of RTIs.",Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,0.4373403489589691
126,2021,33852069,"Background: Earlier studies suggest that probiotics have protective effects in the prevention of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Whether such benefits apply to RTIs of viral origin and mechanisms supporting the effect remain unclear. Aim: To determine the role of gut microbiota modulation on clinical and laboratory outcomes of viral RTIs. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of articles published in Embase and MEDLINE through 20 April 2020 to identify studies reporting the effect of gut microbiota modulation on viral RTIs in clinical studies and animal models. The incidence of viral RTIs, clinical manifestations, viral load and immunological outcomes was evaluated. Results: We included 58 studies (9 randomized controlled trials; 49 animal studies). Six of eight clinical trials consisting of 726 patients showed that probiotics administration was associated with a reduced risk of viral RTIs. Most commonly used probiotics were Lactobacillus followed by Bifidobacterium and Lactococcus. In animal models, treatment with probiotics before viral challenge had beneficial effects against influenza virus infection by improving infection-induced survival (20/22 studies), mitigating symptoms (21/21 studies) and decreasing viral load (23/25 studies). Probiotics and commensal gut microbiota exerted their beneficial effects through strengthening host immunity. Conclusion: Modulation of gut microbiota represents a promising approach against viral RTIs via host innate and adaptive immunity regulation. Further research should focus on next generation probiotics specific to viral types in prevention and treatment of emerging viral RTIs.",Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,0.9742763638496399
126,2021,27495104,"Background: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) represent one of the main health problems in children. Probiotics are viable bacteria that colonize the intestine and affect the host intestinal microbial balance. Accumulating evidence suggests that probiotic consumption may decrease the incidence of or modify RTIs. The authors systematically reviewed data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the effect of probiotic consumption on RTIs in children. Methods: MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were systematically searched for RCTs regarding the effect of probiotics on RTIs in children. The outcomes included number of children experienced with at least 1 RTI episode, duration of illness episodes, days of illness per subject, and school/day care absenteeism due to infection. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled relative risks, or mean difference (MD) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 23 trials involving 6269 children were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. None of the trials showed a high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence of outcomes was moderate. The age range of subjects was from newborn to 18 years. The results of meta-analysis showed that probiotic consumption significantly decreased the number of subjects having at least 1 RTI episode (17 RCTs, 4513 children, relative risk 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.96, P = 0.004). Children supplemented with probiotics had fewer numbers of days of RTIs per person compared with children who had taken a placebo (6 RCTs, 2067 children, MD -0.16, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.02, P = 0.03), and had fewer numbers of days absent from day care/school (8 RCTs, 1499 children, MD -0.94, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.15, P = 0.02). However, there was no statistically significant difference of illness episode duration between probiotic intervention group and placebo group (9 RCTs, 2817 children, MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.49 to 0.30, P = 0.19). Conclusion: Based on the available data and taking into account the safety profile of RCTs, probiotic consumption appears to be a feasible way to decrease the incidence of RTIs in children.",Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,0.9058143496513367

Limited data suggest that aromatherapy massage and reflexology may help to reduce pain and fatigue in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study was to examine and compare the effects of aromatherapy massage and reflexology on pain and fatigue in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The study sample was randomly assigned to either an aromatherapy massage (n = 17), reflexology (n = 17) or the control group (n = 17). Aromatherapy massage was applied to both knees of subjects in the first intervention group for 30 minutes. Reflexology was administered to both feet of subjects in the second intervention group for 40 minutes during weekly home visits. Control group subjects received no intervention. Fifty-one subjects with rheumatoid arthritis were recruited from a university hospital rheumatology clinic in Turkey between July 2014 and January 2015 for this randomized controlled trial. Data were collected by personal information form, DAS28 index, Visual Analog Scale and Fatigue Severity Scale. Pain and fatigue scores were measured at baseline and within an hour after each intervention for 6 weeks. Pain and fatigue scores significantly decreased in the aromatherapy massage and reflexology groups compared with the control group (p .05). The reflexology intervention started to decrease mean pain and fatigue scores earlier than aromatherapy massage (week 1 vs week 2 for pain, week 1 vs week 4 for fatigue) (p .05).

These men, all of whom had either skin type II or III, were randomized to also receive either incremental doses of UVB or PUVA (topical psoralen) twice weekly to one side of their scalp and to a 2.5 cm target area on the nonminoxidil-treated upper ipsilateral arm. Vellus, nonvellus, and total hair counts were done in two 1-inch in diameter circular target areas in symmetric regions of the scalp and on each upper arm at regular intervals. All nine subjects had an increase in target nonvellus hair and a net loss of vellus hair in scalp target area treated with topical minoxidil.

129,2021,19460042,"Synopsis Topical application of minoxidil in bald scalps of stumptailed macaques successfully induced regrowth of terminal hairs. The rate and degree of hair growth by minoxidil are much greater in the early stage of baldness in adolescent and young adults. Minoxidil also prevented the development of baldness when applied on non-bald scalps of peri-adolescent animals. Morphometric analysis of hair follicles (folliculograms) has brought a new aspect in observing cyclic dynamics and growth (transformation) of hair follicles. Using this analytic method and autoradiographic observation of DNA synthesis of hair follicles, the action of minoxidil appears to be a potent mitotic stimulator of the follicular as well as peri-follicular germinal (or reserve) cells, thus inducing an enlargement of vellus follicles through the process of cyclic growth and maintaining anagen follicles in the growing phases. Most importantly, minoxidil has no influence in epidermal keratinocytes, sebaceous glands and other dermal components. During almost 3 years of consecutive treatment, the animals showed no detectable local or systemic side effects when examined by laboratory tests of blood cells, chemistry, steroid hormones, measurement of blood pressure and EKG test.",Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,0.9993364214897156

Three formulations were compared: 2% minoxidil solution, 3% minoxidil solution, and placebo. After 4 months all placebo patients crossed over to treatment with the 3% solution. Of the 96 patients randomized into the study, 79 were evaluable at month 12; 25 of these were in the 2% minoxidil group, 24 were in the 3% minoxidil group, and 29 were in the placebo-to-3% solution switchover group. At monthly intervals a hair count was obtained within a 1-inch diameter area on the scalp vertex. In addition, a gross visual estimate of the degree of new hair growth over the entire balding area was made independently by the investigator and the patient. At the end of 4 months there was significant regrowth of nonvellus (terminal and indeterminate) hairs in the patients using the 2% and 3% solutions (p = 0.0001). The mean nonvellus hair count at month 4 was 162.8 in the 2% minoxidil group, 155.4 in the 3% minoxidil group, and 107.1 in the placebo group. The mean increase in the 2% and 3% treatment groups was 58.2 and 48.8, respectively, whereas the mean increase in the placebo group was 4.0. Total hair counts at month 4 demonstrated significantly more growth of hair in the 2% minoxidil group than in the placebo group (p = 0.013), with no significant difference between the 3% minoxidil group and the other two treatment groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,0.9995224475860596

Physicians placed great store in its power to persuade people to seek medical help as early as possible in the development of the disease, when it was most amenable to treatment; to maintain patients' loyalty through what could be a long, painful and uncertain course of therapy; and to encourage doubts about alternative healers. Some also argued that hope could have beneficial therapeutic and psychological effects for patients. However, we know very little about its meanings for the public. Focusing on a large collection of letters written to the Food and Drug Administration in the 1950s concerning an anti-quackery campaign, this article explores how men and women responded to the competing messages of hope promoted by orthodox cancer organizations and by alternative healers. It asks: What did hope mean to such men and women? How did they construct this meaning? How did they decide which treatments were hopeful and which were not? And, how did they use hope to imagine the social world of cancer?

Yet, the mechanisms involved in how people decide what to eat are not yet fully understood. Here, we examined the role of visual attention in healthy eating intentions and choices. We conducted two-alternative forced choice tests of competing food stimuli that paired healthy and unhealthy foods that varied in taste preference. We manipulated their perceptual salience such that, in some cases, one food item was more perceptually salient than the other. In addition, we manipulated the cognitive load and time pressure to test the generalizability of the salience effect. Results: Manipulating salience had a powerful effect on choice in all situations; even when an unhealthy but tastier food was presented as an alternative, healthy food options were selected more often when they were perceptually salient. Moreover, in a second experiment, food choices on one trial impacted food choices on subsequent trials; when a participant chose the healthy option, they were more likely to choose a healthy option again on the next trial. Furthermore, robust effects of salience on food choice were observed across situations of high cognitive load and time pressure. Conclusions: These results have implications both for understanding the mechanisms of food-related decision-making and for implementing interventions that might make it easier for people to make healthy eating choices.",Is the Hoxsey treatment a good cure for cancer?,hoxsey treatment,0.0,Is the Hoxsey treatment a good cure for cancer?,0.5377601981163025

130,2021,35351166,"Background: The tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the MET oncogene is a major player in cancer. When MET is responsible for the onset and progression of the transformed phenotype (MET-addicted cancers), an efficient block of its oncogenic activation results in potent tumor growth inhibition. Methods: Here we describe a molecular engineered MET antibody (hOA-DN30) and validate its pharmacological activity in MET-addicted cancer models in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacokinetics and safety profile in non-human primates have also been assessed. Results: hOA-DN30 efficiently impaired MET activation and the intracellular signalling cascade by dose and time dependent removal of the receptor from the cell surface (shedding). In vitro, the antibody suppressed cell growth by blocking cell proliferation and by concomitantly inducing cell death in multiple MET-addicted human tumor cell lines. In mice xenografts, hOA-DN30 induced an impressive reduction of tumor masses, with a wide therapeutic window. Moreover, the antibody showed high therapeutic efficacy against patient-derived xenografts generated from MET-addicted gastric tumors, leading to complete tumor regression and long-lasting effects after treatment discontinuation. Finally, hOA-DN30 showed a highly favorable pharmacokinetic profile and substantial tolerability in Cynomolgus monkeys. Conclusions: hOA-DN30 unique ability to simultaneously erase cell surface MET and release the 'decoy' receptor extracellular region results in a paramount MET blocking action. Its remarkable efficacy in a large number of pre-clinical models, as well as its pharmacological features and safety profile in non-human primates, strongly envisage a successful clinical application of this novel single-arm MET therapeutic antibody for the therapy of MET-addicted cancers.",Is the Hoxsey treatment a good cure for cancer?,hoxsey treatment,0.0,Is the Hoxsey treatment a good cure for cancer?,0.8424152731895447

Among the HOXB cluster, HOXB1 was silent in a number of analyzed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) primary cells and cell lines, whereas it was expressed in normal terminally differentiated peripheral blood cells. Methods: We evaluated the biological effects and the transcriptome changes determined by the retroviral transduction of HOXB1 in the human promyelocytic cell line HL60. Results: Our results suggest that the enforced expression of HOXB1 reduces cell growth proliferation, inducing apoptosis and cell differentiation along the monocytic and granulocytic lineages. Accordingly, gene expression analysis showed the HOXB1-dependent down-regulation of some tumor promoting genes, paralleled by the up-regulation of apoptosis- and differentiation-related genes, thus supporting a tumor suppressor role for HOXB1 in AML. Finally, we indicated HOXB1 promoter hypermethylation as a mechanism responsible for HOXB1 silencing.

This is a first study designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of L-theanine augmentation of antipsychotic treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Method: 60 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated in an 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. 400 mg/d of L-theanine was added to ongoing antipsychotic treatment from February 2006 until October 2008. The outcome measures were the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) for neurocognitive functioning, and additional measures of general functioning, side effects, and quality of life. Results: 40 patients completed the study protocol. Compared with placebo, L-theanine augmentation was associated with reduction of anxiety (P = .015; measured by the HARS scale) and positive (P = .009) and general psychopathology (P .001) scores (measured by the PANSS 3-dimensional model).

In the present study, we examined the effects of repeated L-theanine administration on behavior, levels of amino acids in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and hippocampal activity in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, an animal model of anxiety and depressive disorders. Methods: Behavioral tests were performed after 7-10 days of L-theanine (0.4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) or saline administration, followed by CSF sampling for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. An independent set of animals was subjected to [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scanning after the same dose of L-theanine or saline administration for 7 days. Results: In the elevated plus maze test, the time spent in the open arms was significantly longer in the L-theanine group than in the saline group (P = 0.035). In addition, significantly lower CSF glutamate (P = 0.039) and higher methionine (P = 0.024) concentrations were observed in the L-theanine group than in the saline group. A significant increase in the standard uptake value ratio was observed in the hippocampus/cerebellum of the L-theanine group (P 0.001). Conclusions: These results suggest that L-theanine enhances hippocampal activity and exerts anxiolytic effects, which may be mediated by changes in glutamate and methionine levels in the brain.

132,2021,32943275,"Introduction: Steam inhalation is common practice in UK households for coryzal symptoms in adults and children. Steam inhalation has the potential to and has caused significant scald injuries, predominantly due to unintentional contact with the hot water used. Methods: The authors used electronic health records to retrospectively identify all patients admitted with scald injuries secondary to steam inhalation over a 2-year period from January 2018-December 2019 at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, a regional burns centre. Data collected included patient demographics, mechanism of burn, as well as burn size, depth, treatment and any associated complications. An International Burns Injury Database enquiry assessed the national prevalence steam inhalation scalds over the same time period. Results: 19 adult and paediatric patients were identified in our centre over a 2-year period, with an age range of 2 weeks to 91 years old. The majority (16/19, 84%) of patients received burns to their lower body, with three patients receiving burns to their chest and/or upper limbs. Six patients underwent surgery, 98 clinic appointments were utilised and the total length of hospital stay was 83 days. The estimated total cost of treating these 19 patients was over £31,872. Nationally, 201 cases were identified between Jan 2018-Dec 2019. Conclusions: Scald injuries secondary to steam inhalation have a significant impact both in terms of hospital stay and cost. Since this study captured only patients admitted to hospital, the true negative impact of steam inhalation is likely to be much higher than calculated. Better public awareness on the risks of steam inhalation and primary prevention policies could reduce the frequency of such injuries.",Does inhaling steam help treat common cold?,inhaling steam common cold,0.0,Does inhaling steam help treat common cold?,0.5486071705818176

133,2021,25342564,"Purpose: to present clinical guidelines for exercise therapy in depressed patients derived from recent meta-analyses. Method: four meta-analyses on effects of physical exercise on mental and physical in depression were analysed. Results: For mild to moderate depression the effect of exercise may be comparable to antidepressant medication and psychotherapy; for severe depression exercise seems to be a valuable complementary therapy to the traditional treatments. Depression is associated with a high incidence of co-morbid somatic illnesses, especially cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Exercise is extremely powerful in preventing and treating these diseases. Physical exercise is an outstanding opportunity for the treatment of patients who have a mix of mental and physical health problems. Exercise therapy also improves body image, patient s coping strategies with stress, quality of life and independence in activities of daily living in older adults. Conclusions: Physical therapists should be aware, that several characteristics of major depression (e.g. loss of interest, motivation and energy, generalised fatigue, a low self-worth and self-confidence, fear to move, and psychosomatic complaints) and physical health problems interfere with participation in exercise. Therefore, motivational strategies should be incorporated in exercise interventions to enhance the patients' motivation and adherence in exercise programs.

A number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated a reduction in depressive symptoms with both aerobic and non-aerobic exercise interventions. This has been supported in a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, the heterogeneous nature of the exercise intervention trials makes determining the appropriate program variables (frequency, intensity, duration and type of exercise) difficult. Design: A systematic review was undertaken on all RCTs reporting a significant treatment effect of exercise in the treatment of depression. Methods: Studies were analyzed for exercise frequency, intensity, session duration, exercise type, exercise mode, intervention duration, delivery of exercise, level and quality of supervision and compliance. Study quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. Results: Five RCTs published since 2007 met the inclusion criteria and were subsequently analyzed. Most programs were performed three times weekly and of moderate intensity. All included trials used aerobic exercise, either treadmill or outdoor walking, stationary cycle or elliptical cross trainer exercise. Intervention duration ranged from four to twelve weeks. Both group and individual programs were shown to be effective in lowering the symptoms of depression. Some level of supervision is recommended. Conclusions: There is evidence for the use supervised aerobic exercise, undertaken three times weekly at moderate intensity for a minimum of nine weeks in the treatment of depression.

133,2021,22504906,"Physical activity is an effective component of depression management. However, the mechanisms by which exercise affects behavioral disorders remain unclear. The present study was conducted to investigate mechanisms by which voluntary exercise ameliorates depression. Plasma cortisol levels and hippocampal monoamine neurotransmitters were measured. Chronic mild stress (CMS) was used to induce depression in a rat model. The rats were allowed to swim for 10 weeks as part of their exercise treatment. Depressive behavior was analyzed using an open-field test and a sucrose consumption test before and after exercise. Serum cortisol levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. The concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitters in the hippocampus were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The CMS rats showed behavioral improvement after exercise. Compared with the control, serum cortisol levels were significantly increased by CMS. The serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine levels in the hippocampi were significantly increased by exercise.

134,2021,35623316,"In non-permanent parasites, host detachment should take place in an environment that ensures the continuation of their life cycle. Timing of detachment - in combination with the host's space use - affects dispersal and transmission success of the parasites and of the pathogens they vector. Before reaching the adult reproductive stage, ticks need to go through multiple immature developmental stages (larva and nymph), each feeding on host blood. In between the feeding bouts, they often remain in the off-host environment for considerable periods of time. With this study, we aimed to obtain more insight in Ixodes frontalis' off-host habitat use by comparing its detachment pattern in different life stages with that of two habitat-specialized ticks also found on birds: the endophilic tree-hole tick (Ixodes arboricola) and the exophilic sheep tick (Ixodes ricinus), the latter living in humid understory vegetation of forests. For this, we artificially infested hole-roosting (great tits, Parus major) and open-roosting (blackbirds, Turdus merula) birds with ticks under laboratory conditions, and recorded whether detachment occurred during the day or the night. We hypothesize that nocturnal detachment improves off-host mating opportunities and host localization, whereas diurnal detachment optimizes tick dispersal. Ixodes frontalis nymphs detached during the night, especially when feeding on blackbirds. This behaviour was very similar to that of I. arboricola (larva and nymph) feeding on great tits. In contrast, I. frontalis larvae detached during the day, especially when feeding on great tits, which resembles that of I. ricinus' feeding behaviour (larva and nymph). Ixodes frontalis left the host within seven days, immediately after completion of the blood meal. This is similar to both developmental stages of I. ricinus but contrasts with the very long (up to 20 days) feeding duration in I. arboricola. Thus I. frontalis shows strong plasticity, switching from dispersal-centered (larvae) to host-centered (nymphs) detachment behaviour. Findings are discussed with regard to the ticks' habitat use, dispersal, life history and host specificity.",Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,remove tick with vaseline,0.0,Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,0.37571990489959717
134,2021,24237635,"Our study tested whether two European bird-specialized ticks, Ixodes arboricola and I. frontalis, can act as vectors in the transmission cycles of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. The ticks have contrasting ecologies but share songbird hosts (such as the great tit, Parus major) with the generalist I. ricinus which may therefore act as a bridging vector. In the first phase of the experiment, we obtained Borrelia-infected ornithophilic nymphs by exposing larvae to great tits that had previously been exposed to I. ricinus nymphs carrying a community of genospecies (Borrelia garinii, valaisiana, afzelii, burgdorferi s.s., spielmanii). Skin samples showed that birds selectively amplified B. garinii and B. valaisiana. The spirochetes were transmitted to the ornithophilic ticks and survived moulting, leading to infection rates of 16% and 27% in nymphs of I. arboricola and I. frontalis respectively. In the second phase, pathogen-free great tits were exposed to the Borrelia-infected ornithophilic nymphs. None of these ticks were able to infect the birds, as indicated by the tissue samples. Analysis of xenodiagnostic I. ricinus larvae found no evidence for co-feeding or systemic transmission of B. burgdorferi s.l.

134,2021,32426219,"Hosts are typically co-parasitized by multiple species. Parasites can benefit or suffer from the presence of other parasites, which can reduce or increase the overall virulence due to competition or facilitation. Outcomes of new multi-parasite systems are seldom predictable. In 1994 the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum jumped from poultry to songbirds in which it caused an epidemic throughout North America. Songbirds are often parasitized by hard ticks, and can act as reservoirs for tick-borne pathogens. We tested the hypothesis that Mycoplasma infection in house finches influences North America's most important tick vector Ixodes scapularis , by affecting the tick's feeding success, detachment behaviour and survival to the next stage. Most ticks detached during the daylight hours irrespective of the bird's disease status and time since infestation. Birds incrementally invested in anti-tick resistance mechanisms over the course of the experiment; this investment was made earlier in the Mycoplasma -infected birds. At higher tick densities, the feeding success on birds with more severe conjunctivitis was lower than in the uninfected birds. Throughout the experiment we found positive density dependent effects on the tick's feeding success. More diseased hosts suffered more from the tick infestations, as shown by reduced haematocrits. Three Mycoplasma -infected birds died during the weeks following the experiment, although all birds were kept in optimal housing conditions. Mycoplasma made the bird a less accessible and valuable host for ticks, which is an example of ecological interference. Therefore, Mycoplasma has the potential to ultimately reduce transmission outcomes of tick-borne pathogens via songbird hosts.",Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,remove tick with vaseline,0.0,Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,0.4874095022678375
134,2021,24713278,"The objective of this research was to determine the most appropriate protective behaviours to promote in order to protect members of the public from Lyme borreliosis, to identify the drivers and barriers for these behaviours, and to determine the strongest predictors of tick-protective behaviour. We used a mixed methods study with qualitative interviews and a quantitative web survey. Interviews with topic experts and members of the public suggested that predictors of tick checking included perceived disease likelihood and severity as well as overall awareness of ticks and tick-borne disease. Twenty-four percent of participants regularly checked for ticks after walking in a tick-endemic area. The strongest predictors of checking for ticks were greater levels of knowledge, perceived likelihood of being bitten, self-efficacy about tick removal, and lower levels of disgust about ticks.

Additionally, the aim was to perform three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the glomeruli in the olfactory lobes. Unfed female and male adults of this tick species were immobilized, Haller's organ was sectioned, and the olfactory nerves were labelled with a neuronal tracer (1% dextran tetramethylrhodamine). The labelled olfactory lobes were observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope and the images were analyzed using the Reconstruct software. The neuronal projection originating from the olfactory sensilla of Haller's organ was found to be strictly confined to the olfactory lobes of the synganglion, which were organized into glomeruli. Males and females presented corresponding round-shaped glomeruli in the olfactory lobes. The number of glomeruli ranged from 26 to 30 in the males and 24-29 in the females. Positive correlations regarding the glomeruli volumes (μm<sup>3</sup>) intrasexually (females: r = 0.85, P 0.05) and intersexually (r = 0.81, P 0.05) were observed.

134,2021,33168347,"Tick-borne diseases pose a global medical problem. As transmission of tick-borne pathogens to their hosts occurs during tick feeding, development of vaccines thwarting this process could potentially prevent transmission of multiple tick-borne pathogens. The idea of tick vaccines is based on the phenomenon of acquired tick immunity, rejection of ticks feeding on hosts which were repeatedly infested by ticks. Recently, we demonstrated that saliva of the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis, which is the main vector of tick-borne pathogens in northeast USA, is sufficient for induction of tick immunity in the guinea pig model and that immunity directed against tick glycoproteins is important in this phenomenon. Nevertheless, immunity elicited against individual tick salivary antigens, which have been identified and tested so far, provided only modest tick rejection. We therefore now tested fractions of tick saliva produced by liquid chromatography for their ability to induce tick immunity in the guinea pig model. Immunization with all individual fractions elicited antibodies that reacted with tick saliva, however only some fractions displayed the ability to induce robust protective tick immunity. Mass spectrometry analysis led to identification of 24 proteins present only in saliva fractions which were able to induce tick immunity, suggesting suitable candidates for development of a tick vaccine.",Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,remove tick with vaseline,0.0,Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,0.004764774348586798
134,2021,31924502,"Ticks and tick-borne diseases are on the rise world-wide and vaccines to prevent transmission of tick-borne diseases is an urgent public health need. Tick transmission of pathogens to the mammalian host occurs during tick feeding. Therefore, it is reasoned that vaccine targeting of tick proteins essential for feeding would thwart tick feeding and consequently prevent pathogen transmission. The phenomenon of acquired tick-immunity, wherein, repeated tick infestations of non-natural hosts results in the development of host immune responses detrimental to tick feeding has served as a robust paradigm in the pursuit of tick salivary antigens that may be vaccine targeted. While several salivary antigens have been identified, immunity elicited against these antigens have only provided modest tick rejection. This has raised the possibility that acquired tick-immunity is directed against tick components other than tick salivary antigens. Using Ixodes scapularis, the blacklegged tick, that vectors several human pathogens, we demonstrate that immunity directed against tick salivary glycoproteins is indeed sufficient to recapitulate the phenomenon of tick-resistance. These observations emphasize the utility of tick salivary glycoproteins as viable vaccine targets to thwart tick feeding and direct our search for anti-tick vaccine candidates.",Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,remove tick with vaseline,0.0,Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,0.002341357758268714
134,2021,25928557,"Background: Vector-borne pathogens experience a conflict of interest when the arthropod vector chooses a vertebrate host that is incompetent for pathogen transmission. The qualitative manipulation hypothesis suggests that vector-borne pathogens can resolve this conflict in their favour by manipulating the host choice behaviour of the arthropod vector. Methods: European Lyme disease is a model system for studying this conflict because Ixodes ricinus is a generalist tick species that vectors Borrelia pathogens that are specialized on different classes of vertebrate hosts. Avian specialists like B. garinii cannot survive in rodent reservoir hosts and vice versa for rodent specialists like B. afzelii. The present study tested whether Borrelia genospecies influenced the attraction of field-collected I. ricinus nymphs to rodent odours. Results: Nymphs were significantly attracted to questing perches that had been scented with mouse odours. However, there was no difference in questing behaviour between nymphs infected with rodent- versus bird-specialized Borrelia genospecies.

The development and registration of new pesticides has become so costly that many chemical companies are unwilling to pursue it and health-care providers now face a serious lack of new commercial pediculicides. Many infested people resort to using ""home-remedy"" approaches that have not been scientifically tested. In this article, we examined the potential value of six purportedly effective ""home remedies"" (vinegar, isopropyl alcohol, olive oil, mayonnaise, melted butter, and petroleum jelly) to treat head louse infestations and the likelihood of drowning lice by water submersion. Results indicated that only the application of petroleum jelly caused significant louse mortality but no treatment prevented lice from laying eggs. Most home remedy products did little to kill eggs, despite prolonged exposure. Petroleum jelly caused the greatest egg mortality, allowing only 6% to hatch. It was extremely difficult to drown lice, despite extended periods (i.e., 8 hr) of water submersion, suggesting that killing lice by depriving them of oxygen is inefficient. None of the home remedy products we surveyed was an effective means of louse control.

135,2021,10937452,"Head louse infestations (pediculosis) are prevalent worldwide. In developed countries, the infestation rate of 4- to 13-year-old children remains high despite preventive efforts. This is due to the existence of numerous ineffective pediculicides, the incorrect use of the effective agents, toxicological concerns and the development of louse strains resistant to insecticides. One of the most effective tools for the prevention and control of lice is the louse comb, which should be used regularly for the detection of living lice at an early stage of infestation, and as an accessory to any treatment method to remove living and dead lice. The louse comb can also be used systematically for the treatment of infestations, for confirmation that treatment with pediculicides has been successful, and for the removal of nits (dead eggs or egg shells). Most pediculicides are only partially ovicidal. Therefore, 10 days after beginning treatment with any antilouse product, the scalp of the child should be examined. If no living lice are found, the treatment should be discontinued. If living lice are still present, treatment should be continued with a product containing a different active ingredient. Suffocating agents such as olive, soya, sunflower and corn oils, hair gels and mayonnaise are able to kill a significant number of lice only if they are applied in liberal quantities for more than 12 hours. However, they lubricate the hair and therefore may facilitate combing and removing lice and eggs from the scalp. Nits may remain glued on the hair for at least 6 months, even after a successful treatment, and lead to a false positive diagnosis of louse infestation. If nits are seen on the hair, the child should be examined, but treatment should be initiated only if living lice are found. Formulations containing 5% acetic acid or 8% formic acid, as well as acid shampoos (pH 4.5 to 5.5) and conditioners, in combination with a louse comb, can be helpful for removing nits. There is no conclusive evidence that using essential oils to repel lice is effective. Regular examination of the child's head using a louse comb is the best measure to detect re-infestation at an early stage. Educating caregivers, nurses and teachers about louse biology, epidemiology, prevention and control is of paramount importance. The psychological effect of an infestation with lice is significant and often associated with anxiety and fear.

137,2021,29764457,"Background: Mediastinum abscess caused by sharp esophageal foreign body perforation usually needs surgical treatment, and the surgical procedures vary according to size of perforation and scope of abscess, etc. For special case with small esophageal mucosal crevasse and focal abscess confined to mediastinum, minimally invasive surgery with guidance of video-mediastinoscopy would be an alternative method, however, application of video-mediastinoscopy in this life-threatening situation was rarely reported. Case presentation: One patient with detention of fish bone stuck in the esophagus developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Computed tomography results revealed that two high-density foreign bodies migrated extraluminally and caused abscess confined in the mediastinum. Multidisplinary collaborative efforts of anesthesiology, gastroenterology and thoracic surgery were made to optimize the therapeutic process. By taking advantages of wide working channel and better exposure of video-mediastinoscopy, two sharp fish bones were removed with minimal risk of injuring adjacent important tissues, furthermore, complete debridement of the abscess and precise drainage tube indwelling was achieved simultaneously. Postoperative comprehensive therapy including anti-infection and nutrition support guaranteed a smooth transition of perioperative period. Conclusion: This is the first report on application of video-mediastinoscopy in removing two fish bones that migrated extraluminally and debridement of the abscess caused by esophagus perforation with minimal injury risk, which offer a safe and effective minimal invasive method for specific cases.",Will drinking vinegar dissolve a stuck fish bone?,vinegar fish bone stuck,0.0,Will drinking vinegar dissolve a stuck fish bone?,0.892398476600647

138,2021,17682990,"Background: Over the past 20 years, the use of zinc as an over-the-counter alternative therapy for the common cold has vastly grown in popularity. Recent reports of potentially permanent anosmia caused by intranasal zinc therapy warrant careful analysis of the therapeutic effects of zinc. Methods: A search of the Medline database (including articles published during 1966-2006) for studies of zinc and the common cold produced 105 published reports. Fourteen were randomized, placebo-controlled studies that examined the effect of zinc lozenges, nasal sprays, or nasal gels on naturally acquired common colds. Eleven features of experimental design affecting signal quality, chance, bias, and blinding were used to evaluate the 14 placebo-controlled studies. These criteria were validated case definition, quantifiable hypothesis, sample size calculation, randomized assignment, double blinding, proof of blinding, measurement of compliance, measurement of dropout rate, analysis by intent to treat, description of methods of analysis, and measurements of probability. Equal weight was given to each criterion, because failure to meet any one could potentially invalidate the findings of a clinical trial. Results: Four studies met all 11 criteria. Three of these studies reported no therapeutic effect from zinc lozenge or nasal spray. One study reported positive results from zinc nasal gel. Of the remaining 10 studies, 6 reported a positive effect and 4 reported no effect. Intent-to-treat analysis was the most common criterion not met. Conclusions: This structured review suggests that the therapeutic effectiveness of zinc lozenges has yet to be established.

138,2021,23930726,"Background: The common cold is responsible for the largest proportion of school and work absenteeism and is a huge economic burden. None of the currently available interventions is clearly effective for prevention or treatment. Objective: To assess the efficacy of 15-mg chelated zinc (zinc bis-glycinate) given once a day for 3 months during the winter season to healthy school children aged 8-13 years to prevent symptoms of the common cold. Methods: In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, zinc bis-glycinate 15 mg or matching placebo once a day for 3 months was administered to healthy school children aged 8-13 years. Primary outcomes were any symptom of cold (fever, cough, rhinorrhoea) during the study period, and secondary outcomes were vomiting, diarrhoea, use of antibiotics, school absence for any reason, school absence because of a cold and duration of all symptoms. Results: Of 50 children in each group, 42 (84%) in the zinc group and 41 (82%) in the placebo group (P = 1.00) developed at least one symptom of a cold. There was no difference in the incidence of fever, cough, rhinorrhoea, school absence and school absence related to the common cold compared with children in the placebo group. However, duration of cough [median (IQR) 1.0 (0.0-6.0) vs 6.0 (0.0-13.3) days], rhinorrhoea [median (IQR) 2.0 (0.0-7.0) vs 5.5 (1.0-15.3) days] and the frequency of having two or more symptoms of the common cold [median (IQR) 0.0 (0.0-1.0) vs 1.0 (0.0-5.3) days] were reduced significantly in the intervention group (P 0.01). Conclusions: Zinc bis-glycinate given in a dose of 15 mg once a day for 3 months failed to reduce the incidence of the common cold in 8 to 13-year-old school children, but decreased the number of days on which children suffered from cough, rhinorrhoea and the likelihood of having two or more symptoms of the common cold.",Can zinc help treat the common cold?,zinc common cold,1.0,Can zinc help treat the common cold?,0.5173615217208862

No consistently effective therapy for the common cold has been well documented, but evidence suggests that several possible mechanisms may make zinc an effective treatment. Objective: To test the efficacy of zinc gluconate lozenges in reducing the duration of symptoms caused by the common cold. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Setting: Outpatient department of a large tertiary care center. Patients: 100 employees of the Cleveland Clinic who developed symptoms of the common cold within 24 hours before enrollment. Intervention: Patients in the zinc group (n = 50) received lozenges (one lozenge every 2 hours while awake) containing 13.3 mg of zinc from zinc gluconate as long as they had cold symptoms. Patients in the placebo group (n = 50) received similarly administered lozenges that contained 5% calcium lactate pentahydrate instead of zinc gluconate. Main outcome measures: Subjective daily symptom scores for cough, headache, hoarseness, muscle ache, nasal drainage, nasal congestion, scratchy throat, sore throat, sneezing, and fever (assessed by oral temperature). Results: The time to complete resolution of symptoms was significantly shorter in the zinc group than in the placebo group (median, 4.4 days compared with 7.6 days; P 0.001). The zinc group had significantly fewer days with coughing (median, 2.0 days compared with 4.5 days; P = 0.04), headache (2.0 days and 3.0 days; P = 0.02), hoarseness (2.0 days and 3.0 days; P = 0.02), nasal congestion (4.0 days and 6.0 days; P = 0.002), nasal drainage (4.0 days and 7.0 days; P 0.001), and sore throat (1.0 day and 3.0 days; P 0.001).

138,2021,28515951,"Objective: To compare the efficacy of zinc acetate lozenges with zinc gluconate lozenges in common cold treatment and to examine the dose-dependency of the effect. Design: Meta-analysis. Setting: Placebo-controlled zinc lozenge trials, in which the zinc dose was &gt; 75 mg/day. The pooled effect of zinc lozenges on common cold duration was calculated by using inverse-variance random-effects method. Participants: Seven randomised trials with 575 participants with naturally acquired common colds. Main outcome measure: Duration of the common cold. Results: The mean common cold duration was 33% (95% CI 21% to 45%) shorter for the zinc groups of the seven included trials. Three trials that used lozenges composed of zinc acetate found that colds were shortened by 40% and four trials that used zinc gluconate by 28%. The difference between the two salts was not significant: 12 percentage points (95% CI: -12 to + 36). Five trials used zinc doses of 80-92 mg/day, common cold duration was reduced by 33%, and two trials used zinc doses of 192-207 mg/day and found an effect of 35%. The difference between the high-dose and low-dose zinc trials was not significant: 2 percentage points (95% CI: -29 to + 32). Conclusions: Properly composed zinc gluconate lozenges may be as effective as zinc acetate lozenges. There is no evidence that zinc doses over 100 mg/day might lead to greater efficacy in the treatment of the common cold. Common cold patients may be encouraged to try zinc lozenges for treating their colds.

138,2021,21328251,"Background: The common cold is one of the most widespread illnesses and is a leading cause of visits to the doctor and absenteeism from school and work. Trials conducted since 1984 investigating the role of zinc for the common cold symptoms have had mixed results. Inadequate treatment masking and reduced bioavailability of zinc from some formulations have been cited as influencing results. Objectives: To assess the effect of zinc on common cold symptoms. Search strategy: We searched CENTRAL (2010, Issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May week 3, 2010) and EMBASE (1974 to June 2010). Selection criteria: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials using zinc for at least five consecutive days to treat, or for at least five months to prevent the common cold. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Main results: We included 13 therapeutic trials (966 participants) and two preventive trials (394 participants). Intake of zinc is associated with a significant reduction in the duration (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.56 to -0.38) (P = 0.001), and severity of common cold symptoms (SMD -0.39; 95% CI -0.77 to -0.02) (P = 0.04). There was a significant difference between the zinc and control group for the proportion of participants symptomatic after seven days of treatment (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.2 to 1.00) (P = 0.05). The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of developing a cold (IRR 0.64; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.88) (P = 0.006), school absence (P = 0.0003) and prescription of antibiotics (P 0.00001) was lower in the zinc group. Overall adverse events (OR 1.59; 95% CI 0.97 to 2.58) (P = 0.06), bad taste (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.91 to 3.64) (P 0.00001) and nausea (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.44 to 3.23) (P = 0.002) were higher in the zinc group. Authors' conclusions: Zinc administered within 24 hours of onset of symptoms reduces the duration and severity of the common cold in healthy people. When supplemented for at least five months, it reduces cold incidence, school absenteeism and prescription of antibiotics in children. There is potential for zinc lozenges to produce side effects.

138,2021,18279051,"Background: Zinc lozenges have been used for treatment of the common cold; however, the results remain controversial. Methods: Fifty ambulatory volunteers were recruited within 24 h of developing symptoms of the common cold for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of zinc. Participants took 1 lozenge containing 13.3 mg of zinc (as zinc acetate) or placebo every 2-3 h while awake. The subjective scores for common cold symptoms were recorded daily. Plasma zinc, soluble interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1ra), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, soluble vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecule, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1 were assayed on days 1 and 5. Results: Compared with the placebo group, the zinc group had a shorter mean overall duration of cold (4.0 vs. 7.1 days; P .0001) and shorter durations of cough (2.1 vs. 5.0 days; P .0001) and nasal discharge (3.0 vs. 4.5 days, P = .02) Blinding of subjects was adequate, and adverse effects were comparable in the 2 groups. Symptom severity scores were decreased significantly in the zinc group. Mean changes in plasma levels of zinc, sIL-1ra, and ICAM-1 differed significantly between groups.

139,2021,24066023,"Background: Folklore remedies for pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis include the application of magnets and copper to the skin. Despite the popular use of devices containing magnets or copper for this purpose, little research has been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of such treatments. Objective: To investigate whether the practice of wearing magnetic wrists straps, or copper bracelets, offers any specific therapeutic benefit for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Design: Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Methods: 70 patients, aged 33 to 79 years and predominantly female (n = 52), with painful rheumatoid arthritis were recruited from general practices within Yorkshire. Participants were randomly allocated to wear four devices in a different order. Devices tested were: a standard (1502 to 2365 gauss) magnetic wrist strap, a demagnetised ( 20 gauss) wrist strap, an attenuated (250 to 350 gauss) magnetic wrist strap, and a copper bracelet. Devices were each worn for five weeks, with treatment phases being separated by one week wash-out periods. The primary outcome measured was pain using a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Secondary pain measures were the McGill Pain Questionnaire and tender joint count. Inflammation was assessed using C-reactive protein and plasma viscosity blood tests and by swollen joint count. Physical function was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (Disability Index). Disease activity and medication use was also measured. Results: 65 participants provided complete self-report outcome data for all devices, four participants provided partial data. Analysis of treatment outcomes did not reveal any statistically significant differences (P&gt;0.05) between the four devices in terms of their effects on pain, inflammation, physical function, disease activity, or medication use. Conclusions: Wearing a magnetic wrist strap or a copper bracelet did not appear to have any meaningful therapeutic effect, beyond that of a placebo, for alleviating symptoms and combating disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis.

139,2021,18789135,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis is a common inflammatory autoimmune disease. Although disease activity may be managed effectively with prescription drugs, unproven treatments such as magnet therapy are sometimes used as an adjunct for pain control. Therapeutic devices incorporating permanent magnets are widely available and easy to use. Magnets may also be perceived as a more natural and less harmful alternative to analgesic compounds. Of interest to health service researchers is the possibility that magnet therapy might help to reduce the economic burden of managing chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Magnets are extremely cheap to manufacture and prolonged treatment involves a single cost. Despite this, good quality scientific evidence concerning the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of magnet therapy is scarce. The primary aim of the CAMBRA trial is to investigate the effectiveness of magnet therapy for relieving pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. Methods/design: The CAMBRA trial employs a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Participant will each wear four devices: a commercially available magnetic wrist strap; an attenuated wrist strap; a demagnetised wrist strap; and a copper bracelet. Device will be allocated in a randomised sequence and each worn for five weeks. The four treatment phases will be separated by wash out periods lasting one week. Both participants and researchers will be blind, as far as feasible, to the allocation of experimental and control devices. In total 69 participants will be recruited from general practices within the UK. Eligible patients will have a verified diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis that is being managed using drugs, and will be experiencing chronic pain. Outcomes measured will include pain, inflammation, disease activity, physical function, medication use, affect, and health related costs. Data will be collected using questionnaires, diaries, manual pill counts and blood tests. Discussion: Magnetism is an inherent property of experimental devices which is hard to conceal. The use of multiple control devices, including a copper bracelet, represents a concerted attempt to overcome methodological limitations associated with trials in this field. The trial began in July 2007. At the time of submission (August 2008) recruitment has finished, with 70 trial participants, and data collection is almost complete.

139,2021,19942103,"Objectives: To test the effectiveness of a typical magnetic wrist strap for reducing pain and stiffness, and for improving physical functioning amongst patients with osteoarthritis. Design: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Each participant wore four devices over a 16-week period. Setting: Forty five patients with osteoarthritis were recruited from general practices in rural and urban areas of Yorkshire. Interventions: Experimental device: a commercially available magnetic wrist strap. Control devices: a weak magnetic wrist strap, a demagnetised wrist strap, and a copper bracelet. Main outcome measures: The WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index, the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Pain Rating Index (PRI), a pain visual analogue scale (VAS), and medication use. Results: No difference was observed between devices in terms of their effects on pain as measured by the primary outcome measure (WOMAC A), the PRI and the VAS. Similar results were obtained for stiffness (WOMAC B), physical function (WOMAC C), and medication use. Further analyses of the PRI subscales revealed a statistically significant difference between devices (P=0.025), which favoured the experimental device. Participants reported lower sensory pain after wearing the standard magnetic wrist strap, than when wearing control devices. However, no adjustment was made for multiple testing. Conclusions: Our results indicate that magnetic and copper bracelets are generally ineffective for managing pain, stiffness and physical function in osteoarthritis. Reported therapeutic benefits are most likely attributable to non-specific placebo effects.

We excluded t'ai chi and acupuncture, which have been the subject of recent reviews. Methods: Randomized controlled trials, published in English up to May 2011, were identified using systematic searches of bibliographic databases and searching of reference lists. Information was extracted on outcomes, statistical significance in comparison with alternative treatments and reported side effects. The methodological quality of the identified studies was determined using the Jadad scoring system. Outcomes considered were pain and patient global assessment. Results: In all, 16 eligible trials were identified covering 12 therapies. Overall, there was no good evidence of the effectiveness of any of the therapies in relation to pain or global health improvement/quality of life because most therapies only had a single randomized controlled trial. Where positive results were reported, they were often comparing an active intervention with no intervention. Therapies with multiple trials either provided null (biofeedback) or inconsistent results (magnet therapy), or the trials available scored poorly for quality (chiropractic). There were few adverse events reported in the trials.

This involved wearing 'copper bracelets' and placebo bracelets (amodised aluminum resembling copper) alternately. These groups, as also a control group, answered questionnaires. The copper bracelets were weighed before and after use. Preliminary results show that, to a significant number of subjects, the wearing of the 'copper bracelet' appeared to have some therapeutic value. A study of the components of sweat and the solubility of copper in sweat was carried out. In five sweat samples, the copper concentration was of the order 2 x 10(-5) M and after equilibrating with copper turnings at room temperature for 24 hours the samples turned blue in colour and contained approximately 2 x 10(-3) M copper. The permeability of skin to copper containing solutions has also been discussed. It has also been shown that the wearing of a 'copper bracelet' results in a weight loss in excess of the body's total burden of copper (100-150 mg).

139,2021,17893349,"Background: Static magnets are marketed with claims of effectiveness for reducing pain, although evidence of scientific principles or biological mechanisms to support such claims is limited. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical evidence from randomized trials of static magnets for treating pain. Methods: Systematic literature searches were conducted from inception to March 2007 for the following data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), CINAHL, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and the UK National Research Register. All randomized clinical trials of static magnets for treating pain from any cause were considered. Trials were included only if they involved a placebo control or a weak magnet as the control, with pain as an outcome measure. The mean change in pain, as measured on a 100-mm visual analogue scale, was defined as the primary outcome and was used to assess the difference between static magnets and placebo. Results: Twenty-nine potentially relevant trials were identified. Nine randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing pain with a visual analogue scale were included in the main meta-analysis; analysis of these trials suggested no significant difference in pain reduction (weighted mean difference [on a 100-mm visual analogue scale] 2.1 mm, 95% confidence interval -1.8 to 5.9 mm, p = 0.29). This result was corroborated by sensitivity analyses excluding trials of acute effects and conditions other than musculoskeletal conditions. Analysis of trials that assessed pain with different scales suggested significant heterogeneity among the trials, which means that pooling these data is unreliable. Interpretation: The evidence does not support the use of static magnets for pain relief, and therefore magnets cannot be recommended as an effective treatment. For osteoarthritis, the evidence is insufficient to exclude a clinically important benefit, which creates an opportunity for further investigation.",Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,copper bracelets reduce pain,0.0,Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,0.2831759452819824

Results: Mean pain scores were reduced more in the standard magnet group than in the dummy group (mean difference 1.3 points, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 2.55). Self reported blinding status did not affect the results. The scores for secondary outcome measures were consistent with the WOMAC A scores.

Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with people with chronic knee pain, before (n=29) and after (n=23) participation on the programme. Thematic analysis was used to document people's baseline health beliefs, attitudes and cognitions, and to see if how and why these changed after completing the programme. Results: Initially people had poor understanding and negative, fatalistic beliefs about the management or prognosis for knee pain. Following the programme the majority of participants had positive experiences describing improvement in pain, physical and psychosocial functioning, greater knowledge and understanding of their condition and treatment options, and in their ability to use exercise to control symptoms. Beliefs about the causation and prognosis of knee pain were unchanged, but their concerns about possible dangers of exercise had decreased, they appreciated how exercise could reduce symptoms (treatment beliefs) and their confidence in their ability to use exercise to effect improvements (exercise self-efficacy) increased. These improvements were attributed to the content and structure of the programme, and the care and guidance of the physiotherapist. Several expressed a need for on-going support. Conclusions: ESCAPE-knee pain appears to achieve improvements by increasing people's treatment belief in safety and the utility of exercise to control symptoms, rather than alteration in their beliefs about causation or prognosis.

Nail involvement is characterised by ungual thickening and discoloration. Incidence/prevalence: In the United Kingdom, athlete's foot is present in about 15% of the general population, and 1.2 million people have fungally infected toenails. Aetiology/risk factors: Swimming pool users and industrial workers may have increased risk of fungal foot infection. However, one survey found fungal foot infection in only 8.5% of swimmers, with the highest incidence (20%) in men aged 16 years and over. Prognosis: Fungal infections of the foot are not life threatening in people with normal immunity, but in some people they cause persistent symptoms. Other people seem to be oblivious of persistent infection. The infection can spread to other parts of the body and to other people. Aims: To control symptoms and prevent recurrence, with minimal adverse effects.

140,2021,6443779,"An enzymatically active pigment-producing clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to produce a diffusible antifungal product that was shown to be inhibitory to the growth of several dermatophytes, specifically, Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum gypseum, and Microsporum audouini. In this study, Trichophyton rubrum was used as the test organism. The antifungal product was partially purified by Sephadex column chromatography and was found to be stable at 5 degrees, 25 degrees, and 37 degrees C. Several investigators have alluded to the fact that as asymptomatic cases of dermatophytosis simplex progress to symptomatic dermatophytosis complex, the bacterial profile changes from a gram-positive bacterial ecosystem to a gram-negative bacterial over-growth. The primary event in the pathogenesis of interdigital athlete's foot is the invasion of the horny layer by dermatophytes. This presents as a mild to moderate scaly lesion and is asymptomatic. As a result of predisposing factors, such as hyperhidrosis, occlusion by tight shoes, minute abrasions due to friction, and fungal-infected skin surfaces, dynamic overgrowth of opportunistic gram-negative bacilli prevails. As the gram-negative population increases, the recovery of dermatophytes dramatically diminishes, until a point is reached when no dermatophytes can be recovered from clinically symptomatic tinea pedis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibiting its fungal competitor Trichophyton rubrum by producing a diffusible antifungal agent into the infectious environment of the intertriginous foot lesion. Clinically, the patient is diagnosed as having tinea pedis; laboratory culture for fungus and KOH are negative, and what was a paradox just a few years ago can currently be identified and treated appropriately as gram-negative athlete's foot.",Can fungal creams treat athlete's foot?,fungal cream athlete's foot,1.0,Can fungal creams treat athlete's foot?,0.4908183515071869

141,2021,25255817,"Striae gravidarum (SG), or stretch marks developing during pregnancy, affect up to 90% of women. While not medically dangerous, SG can be disfiguring, causing emotional and psychological distress. However, studies specifically addressing the prevention of SG, especially during pregnancy, are sparse. Furthermore, the molecular pathogenesis of SG is unclear and may differ from that of striae from other causes. Considering these factors, we review topical modalities that have been used specifically for preventing SG during pregnancy. We identify two major strategies (end points) addressed by these modalities, namely (i) preventing the de novo development of SG and (ii) reducing the severity of SG that have recently developed. We also identify risk factors for the development of SG and suggest that pregnant women with these risk factors are an appropriate target population for prevention. In reviewing the literature, we find that there is limited evidence that centella, and possibly massage with bitter almond oil, may prevent SG and/or reduce their severity. There is weak evidence that hyaluronic acid prevents SG. Tretinoin holds promise for reducing the severity of new-onset SG, but its use is limited by its pregnancy category. Finally, cocoa butter and olive oil are not effective for preventing SG or reducing the severity of lesions. We conclude that reliable methods for preventing SG are scarce. Furthermore, available topical modalities generally lack strong evidence from rigorous, well-designed, randomized controlled trials with ample numbers of subjects.

A variety of products are available and promoted as ways to prevent or reduce their development, but it is not clear what products are used most commonly. The objective of this study was to identify topical products used during pregnancy to prevent or reduce the development of striae gravidarum. We also explored issues around application of the product, cost incurred and influences on women's decisions to use a product. Methods: In this cross sectional, descriptive survey we collected data from 773 women, via a paper (n = 707) or online (n = 66) questionnaire. Due to missing data in the online survey, 753 women at 36 weeks gestation or more were included in the analyses. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were undertaken. Results: Most respondents (n = 589, 78.2 %) indicated that they used a product to prevent or reduce the development of stretch marks during their current pregnancy. A large range of products were used and more than one third of women (n = 210, 36.5 %) had used two or more products. Bio-oil was the most frequently used product (n = 351, 60.9 %) and it was also the most frequently used product among women who used only one product (n = 189, 32.8 %).

141,2021,26486318,"Striae distensae (SD) are common dermal lesions, with significant physical and psychological impact. Many therapeutic modalities are available but none can completely eradicate SD. The most common therapy is the application of topicals used both therapeutically and prophylactically. Even though there are many commercially available topical products, not all have sufficient level of evidence to support their continued use in SD. The aim here was to assess the evidence for the use of topicals in SD and to propose a structured approach in managing SD. A systematic search of published literature and manufacturer website information for topicals in SD was carried out. The results showed that there are few studies (n = 11) which investigate the efficacy of topicals in management of SD. Trofolastin and Alphastria creams demonstrated level-2 evidence of positive results for their prophylactic use in SD. Additionally, tretinoin used therapeutically showed varying results whilst cocoa butter and olive oil did not demonstrate any effect. Overall, there is a distinct lack of evidence for each topical formulation. The majority of topicals failed to mention their effect on early vs. later stages of SD (striae rubrae compared to striae albae) and their role in both prevention and treatment. In conclusion, there is no topical formulation, which is shown to be most effective in eradicating or improving SD.

They appear as red or purple lines or streaks that fade slowly to leave pale lines or marks on the skin. The abdomen, breasts and thighs are commonly affected. The exact cause of stretch marks is unclear and no preparation has yet been shown to be effective in preventing the development of stretch marks. They are a source of significant anxiety for women, impacting on their quality of life. Objectives: To assess the effects of topical preparations on the prevention of stretch marks in pregnancy. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2011) and reference lists of retrieved reports. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing topical preparations (with active ingredients) with other topical preparations (with active ingredients), with a placebo (that is, preparations without active ingredients) or with no treatment for the prevention of stretch marks in pregnant women. Data collection and analysis: Three review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and trial quality, and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. The primary outcome was the presence of stretch marks and the secondary outcome was the severity of stretch marks. Main results: We included six trials involving 800 women. Of the six trials, we judged the risk of bias for three as 'low risk' for random sequence generation, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, completeness of outcome data and selective reporting.There was no statistically significant average difference in the development of stretch marks in women who received topical preparations with active ingredients compared to women who received a placebo or no treatment (average risk ratio (RR) 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.03; five trials, 474 women; random-effects model, Tau² = 0.09, I² = 65%) (Analysis 1.1).Results were consistent with the main effects when we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding studies judged to be at high risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment or more than 20% missing data for a given outcome (average RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.10; four trials, 424 women; random-effects model, Tau² = 0.05, I² = 57%).The was no statistically significant average mean difference in the severity of stretch marks (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.31; 95% CI -1.06 to 0.44; two trials, 255 women; Tau² = 0.26, I² = 87%).There was no statistically significant difference in the development of stretch marks in women who received topical preparations with active ingredients compared to women who received other topical preparations with active ingredients (average RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.60; two trials, 305 women; Tau² = 0.53, I² = 74%).

Authors' conclusions: We found no high-quality evidence to support the use of any of the topical preparations in the prevention of stretch marks during pregnancy. There is a clear need for robust, methodologically rigorous randomised trials involving larger sample sizes to evaluate the effects of topical preparations on the development of stretch marks in pregnancy.

They discovered a relationship between the whole microbial colonization and the initiation and development of different medical disorders. Besides already known probiotics, novel products such as postbiotics and paraprobiotics have been developed in recent years to create new non-viable micro-organisms or bacterial-free extracts, which can provide benefits to the host with additional bioactivity to probiotics, but without the risk of side effects. The best alternatives in the use of probiotics and postbiotics to maintain the health of the intestinal microbiota and to prevent the attachment of pathogens to children and adults are highlighted and discussed as controversies and challenges. Updated knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the balance between microbiota and immune system for the introspection on the gut-lung-brain axis could reveal the latest benefits and perspectives of applied photobiomics for health. Multiple interconditioning between photobiomodulation (PBM), probiotics, and the human microbiota, their effects on the human body, and their implications for the management of viral infectious diseases is essential. Coupled complex PBM and probiotic interventions can control the microbiome, improve the activity of the immune system, and save the lives of people with immune imbalances. There is an urgent need to seek and develop innovative treatments to successfully interact with the microbiota and the human immune system in the coronavirus crisis. In the near future, photobiomics and metabolomics should be applied innovatively in the SARS-CoV-2 crisis (to study and design new therapies for COVID-19 immediately), to discover how bacteria can help us through adequate energy biostimulation to combat this pandemic, so that we can find the key to the hidden code of communication between RNA viruses, bacteria, and our body.",Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,probiotics child diarrhea caused by antibiotics ,1.0,Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,0.9296922087669373

Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were also searched. Selection criteria: Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0-18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Study selection, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment using the risk of bias instrument were conducted independently and in duplicate by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea and adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea and mean daily stool frequency) as mean difference (MD), along with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, sensitivity analyses included available case versus extreme-plausible analyses and random- versus fixed-effect models. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analysis was conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and risk of bias. We also conducted post hoc subgroup analyses by patient diagnosis, single versus multi-strain, industry sponsorship, and inpatient status. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. Main results: Overall, 23 studies (3938 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either Bacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., or Streptococcus spp., alone or in combination. Eleven studies used a single-strain probiotic, four combined two probiotic strains, three combined three probiotic strains, one combined four probiotic strains, two combined seven probiotic strains, one included ten probiotic strains, and one study included two probiotic arms that used three and two strains, respectively. The risk of bias was determined to be high or unclear in 13 studies and low in 10 studies. Available case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 22/23 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo, or no treatment control. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (163/1992) compared to 19% (364/1906) in the control group (RR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.35-0.61; I2 = 55%, 3898 participants). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate. This benefit remained statistically significant in an extreme-plausible (60% of children lost to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% lost to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea) sensitivity analysis, where the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 14% (330/2294) compared to 19% (426/2235) in the control group (RR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.54-0.89; I2 = 63%, 4529 participants). None of the 16 trials (n = 2455) that reported on adverse events documented any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Meta-analysis excluded all but an extremely small non-significant difference in adverse events between treatment and control (RD = 0.00, 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.01). The majority of adverse events were in placebo, standard care, or no treatment group. Adverse events reported in the studies include rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, vomiting, increased phlegm, chest pain, constipation, taste disturbance, and low appetite. AUTHORS׳ CONCLUSIONS: Moderate quality evidence suggests a protective effect of probiotics in preventing AAD. Our pooled estimate suggests a precise (RR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.35-0.61) probiotic effect with an NNT of 10. Among the various probiotics evaluated, Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5-40 billion colony-forming units/day may be appropriate given the modest NNT and the likelihood that adverse events are very rare. It is premature to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of other probiotic agents for pediatric AAD. Although no serious adverse events were observed among otherwise healthy children, serious adverse events have been observed in severely debilitated or immunocompromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation. Until further research has been conducted, probiotic use should be avoided in pediatric populations at risk for adverse events. Future trials would benefit from a standard and valid outcomes to measure AAD.",Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,probiotics child diarrhea caused by antibiotics ,1.0,Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,0.8131933808326721

In the meantime, controlled, randomized studies have shown that probiotics can exercise a preventive effect in antibiotic-related diarrhea.

142,2021,17443557,"Background: Antibiotics alter the microbial balance within the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics may prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) via restoration of the gut microflora. Antibiotics are prescribed frequently in children and AAD is common in this population. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children. To assess adverse events associated with the use of probiotics when co-administered with antibiotics in children. Search strategy: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL , AMED, and the Web of Science (inception to August 2006) were searched along with specialized registers including the Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group, CISCOM, Chalmers PedCAM Research Register and trial registries from inception to 2005. Letters were sent to authors of included trials, nutra/pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the field requesting additional information on ongoing or unpublished trials. Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were hand searched. Selection criteria: Randomized, parallel, controlled (placebo, active, or no treatment) trials comparing co-administered probiotics with antibiotics for the prevention of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use in children (0 to 18 years). Data collection and analysis: Methodological quality assessment and data extraction were conducted independently by two authors (BCJ, AS). Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea, adverse events) were combined using pooled relative risks, and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea, mean daily stool frequency) as weighted mean differences, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Adverse events were summarized using risk difference. For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, a priori sensitivity analyses included per protocol versus intention to treat, random versus fixed effects, and methodological quality criterion. Subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and antibiotic agent. Main results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either Lactobacilli spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., or Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination. Six studies used a single strain probiotic agent and four combined two probiotic strains. The per protocol analysis for 9/10 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show statistically significant results favouring probiotics over active/non active controls (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.74). However, intention to treat analysis showed non-significant results overall (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.63). Five of ten trials monitored for adverse events (n = 647); none reported a serious adverse event. Authors' conclusions: Probiotics show promise for the prevention of pediatric AAD. While per protocol analysis yields treatment effect estimates that are both statistically and clinically significant, as does analysis of high quality studies, the estimate from the intention to treat analysis was not statistically significant. Future studies should involve probiotic strains and doses with the most promising evidence (e.g., Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus sporogenes, Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day). Research done to date does not permit determination of the effect of age (e.g., infant versus older children) or antibiotic duration (e.g., 5 days versus 10 days). Future trials would benefit from a validated primary outcome measure for antibiotic-associated diarrhea that is sensitive to change and reflects what treatment effect clinicians, parents, and children consider important.

In this clinical review, we evaluate the literature associated with using probiotics in common pediatric gastrointestinal disorders, focusing specifically on antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), colic, inflammatory bowel disease, and functional gastrointestinal diseases. Meta-analysis of several randomized controlled trials have confirmed benefit for the administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea and to treat acute infectious diarrhea. Individual studies have also suggested benefit of probiotics to prevent acute gastroenteritis and serve as an adjunct in ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, CDI, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic in breastfed babies.

142,2021,16908901,"Background: Antibiotic treatment is known to disturb gastrointestinal microflora, which results in a range of clinical symptoms--most notably, diarrhea. This is especially important in children, for whom antibiotics are prescribed frequently. Although meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the ability of probiotics to prevent antibiotic-induced diarrhea in the general population, little is known about which probiotic strains and doses might be of most benefit to children. Our objective in this study was to assess the efficacy of probiotics (of any specified strain or dose) for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children and to assess adverse events associated with the use of probiotics when coadministered with antibiotics to children. Methods: A comprehensive search was performed of the major electronic databases (e.g., CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED) from their inception to January 2005. We also contacted experts and searched registries and meeting abstracts for additional relevant articles. Randomized controlled trials that compared probiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, involving pediatric subjects less than 19 years of age were included. Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria and assessed the studies for methodological quality. Data were independently extracted by 2 reviewers and analyzed via the standard Cochrane methodology. Results: Six studies were included (total n = 707 patients). The combined results, analyzed with a per-protocol method that reported on the incidence of diarrhea during antibiotic treatment, showed significant benefit for the use of probiotics over placebo (relative risk [RR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.75, Iota2 = 70.1%). In contrast, results from intention-to-treat analysis were nonsignificant overall (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.64-1.61). Subgroup analysis on 4 studies that provided at least 5 billion single-strain colony-forming units (CFUs) daily (range 5.5-40 x 10(9) Lactobacillus GG, L. sporogens or Saccharomyces boulardii) showed strong evidence with narrow CIs for the preventative effects of probiotics for antibiotic-associated diarrhea (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25-0.53, Iota2 = 3.5%). No serious adverse events were reported. Interpretation: The potential protective effects of probiotics to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children do not withstand intention-to-treat analysis. Before routine use is recommended, further studies (with limited losses of subjects to follow-up) are merited. Trials should involve those probiotic strains and doses with the most promising evidence (i.e., Lactobacillus GG, L. sporogens or S. boulardii at 5-40 x 10(9) CFUs daily).",Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,probiotics child diarrhea caused by antibiotics ,1.0,Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,0.8637897968292236

Manifestations of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea range from mild self-limiting forms to severe life-threatening courses. The potentially most severe form of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is caused by Clostridium diffcile accounting for approx. 25 % of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.

A fixed drug eruption (FDE) was diagnosed and the patient was asked to avoid Tylenol and other OTC lozenges. Tylenol was entered as an allergy in the electronic medical records. However, since Tylenol, not acetaminophen was listed in the allergy profile, the order for acetaminophen and codeine did not generate an alert for the prescribing physician.

143,2021,32875692,"Non-Uremic Calciphylaxis (NUC) is a rare condition that often manifests as intractable and painful integumentary wounds, afflicting patients with a high burden of co-morbidity. The Endocannabinoid System (ECS) is a ubiquitous signalling system that is theorised to be dysregulated within wound beds and associated peri-wound tissues. Preclinical research has shown that the dominant chemical classes derived from the cannabis plant, cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids, interact with the integumentary ECS to promote wound closure and analgesia. This is a prospective open label cohort study involving two elderly Caucasian females with recalcitrant NUC leg ulcers of greater than 6 months duration. Topical Cannabis-Based Medicines (TCBM) composed of cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids were applied daily to both the wound bed and peri-wound tissues until complete wound closure was achieved. Wounds were photographed regularly, and the digital images were subjected to planimetric analysis to objectively quantify the degree of granulation and epithelization. Analgesic utilisation, as a surrogate/proxy for pain scores, was also tracked. The cohort had a mean M3 multimorbidity index score of 3.31. Complete wound closure was achieved in a mean of 76.3 days. Additionally, no analgesics were required after a mean of 63 days. The treatments were well tolerated with no adverse reactions. The positive results demonstrated in very challenging wounds such as NUC, among highly complex patients, suggest that TCBM may have an even broader role within integumentary and wound management. This treatment paradigm warrants being trialled in other wound types and classes, and ultimately should be subjected to randomised controlled trials.",Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,0.6580566167831421

A randomized controlled trial using a repeated measures design was used. Cognitively intact persons (institutionalized and community) with a diagnosis of OA of the knee joint(s) received either HT sessions three times per week for 6 weeks (n = 12) or weekly friendly visits (FV) (n = 7). The HT sessions were delivered by a team of two nurses certified as HT practitioners and the FV was conducted by a nurse. All subjects continued to receive their standard care including the methods they had been using to relieve their joint pain. The two groups were similar regarding demographic variables, number of knees affected, co-morbidities, pain medications used and outcome variables at baseline. Two pain outcome measures (intensity and life interference) produced significant interaction effects. Two joint outcome measures (extension and extensor lag) also produced significant interaction effects. Furthermore, the HT group demonstrated significant improvements in 9 of the 12 outcome variables (75%) while no significant improvements occurred in the FV group. The HT group exhibited sustained effects (3 weeks post treatments) in three outcome variables.

143,2021,33972347,"Objectives: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of health-related disability. In the absence of curative non-operative therapies, treatment goals are limited to symptom relief. Data are limited on how patients and physicians prioritise available treatment options. We assessed patients' preferences for and physicians' attitudes towards intra-articular treatments including corticosteroids (IACS), an extended-release corticosteroid (TA-ER) and hyaluronic acids (IAHA). Methods: We conducted a prospective, IRB-exempt, double-blind survey of patients with and providers who treat knee OA. Respondents were required to have received or prescribed TA-ER in a non-trial setting. We evaluated patients' OA history, impact of knee OA and treatment preferences, and physicians' decision-making and prescribing experiences. Results: Of the 97 patient participants, mean age was 56 years, 70.0% were women, 75.0% had bilateral knee OA and 46.4% were diagnosed over 5 years ago. Of the 50 physician participants, 42.0% were orthopaedic surgeons, 34.0% were rheumatologists and 60.0%, on average, treat 50+ patients with knee OA per month. Treatment selection factors considered 'very important' to patients and physicians included disease severity (88.7%, 82.0%), impact on quality of life (88.7%, 72.0%), disease extent (84.5%, 54.0%) and activity level (80.4%, 64.0%). A majority (93.8%) of patients indicated moderate to severe difficulty with their knees. Fewer patients (76.3%) reported shared decision making compared with physicians (92.0%). Half (50.5%) of the patients reported that they experienced months of pain relief with TA-ER, 27.7% with IACS and 18.8% with IAHA. Physician assessments were consistent but estimated a greater duration of treatment effects than that reported by patients across all therapies. Conclusion: While knee OA has a tremendous impact on patients, there are significant unmet treatment needs. The increasing use of patient-reported outcomes will allow patients and physicians to track pain and functional status over time and across therapies, improving shared decision-making.",Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,0.347477525472641

Design and setting: This was an uncontrolled, retrospective study conducted at a single US clinical orthopaedic practice. Patients: 248 patients with moderate to severe OA of the knee. Intervention: All patients received a single course of intra-articular Hyalgan® therapy during an 18-month period, and had a radiogram of the treated knee within the 6 months before treatment. Results: A total of 218 of 363 (60.1%) knees (248 patients) with moderate to severe OA were judged successfully treated over a 6-month follow-up period; only 20.3% of cases required TKR. On the basis of a multivariate analysis that correlated improvements in pain and QOL assessed by a retrospective questionnaire with baseline patient and disease characteristics, taller patients (&gt;165cm), patients with less severe OA, and patients with patellofemoral compartment involvement had the greatest improvement in pain relief and quality of life following treatment with Hyalgan®.

143,2021,16583418,"Objective: To explore the experience of adherence to pain medication in older adults with osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: Individuals were recruited from an existing cohort (n = 1,300) of persons with disabling hip and knee OA. Twenty-seven individuals who reported previous physician visits for their arthritis, spoke English, were Toronto residents, and were receptive to in-depth interviews were approached by the cohort telephone interviewer to discuss their experiences with prescribed painkillers for OA. Semistructured face-to-face interviews were conducted by a qualitative researcher in participants' homes. Results: Nineteen adults (10 women, 9 men) ages 67-92 years were interviewed for 1-3 hours. Participants varied in their socioeconomic status and education levels. Most had comorbidities, such as heart disease and diabetes, for which they were also being treated. Findings indicated that adherence to pain medication differed from that of other prescribed medications. Participants were reluctant to take painkillers, and when they did, they generally took them at a lower dose or frequency than prescribed. This behavior did not reflect their recommendations for others, who they expected to be treated appropriately for pain and to adhere to pain medication. Perceptions and attitudes to pain played an integral role in participants' adherence to painkillers. Despite obvious physical limitations, participants minimized their pain and claimed to have a high pain tolerance. Conclusion: These findings suggest that reevaluation of the prescription of pain medication for OA is warranted and that the effectiveness of pain management in OA needs to account for adherence behavior in older adults.",Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,0.5049741864204407
143,2021,23408077,"Objective: To examine accounts of medication use in participants with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from symptom onset to early postdiagnosis. Design: Qualitative study with in-depth, personal interviews. Participants: 37 women and one man, aged 30-70s, with a diagnosis of RA 12 months. Main outcome measure: Participants' experiences and feelings of medication use in early RA. Setting: British Columbia, Canada. Results: Medications were central to how people managed symptoms and disease. Two main themes were identified, showing that optimum medication use was hampered, and how this related to delayed diagnosis and effective care. The first theme, 'paradox of prediagnosis reliance on over the counter (OTC) medications', describes how people's self-management with OTC medications was 'effective'. Participants relied extensively on OTC medications for pain relief and to maintain 'normal life'. However, as this contributed to delayed medical consultation, diagnosis and effective treatment, OTC medication was also potentially detrimental to disease outcome. The second theme, 'ambivalence around prescription medications post diagnosis', describes how adherence was hindered by patient beliefs, priorities and ambivalence towards medications. Conclusions: This study highlights how people use medications in early RA and contributes to a better understanding of medication use that may transfer to other conditions. Given the drive towards active self-management in healthcare and patients' ambivalence about using strong medications, an in-depth understanding of how these combined factors impact patient experiences will help healthcare providers to support effective medication practices. The reported extensive reliance on OTC medications may speak to a care gap needing further investigation in the context of health behaviours and outcomes of patient self-management.",Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,0.3255334794521332
143,2021,17138477,"Background: Concerns about direct-to-consumer advertisement's (DTCA's) information quality have raised interest in patients' drug information-seeking after DTCA exposure. Objective: To identify predictors of patients' intentions and behaviors to seek drug information from physicians, pharmacists, and the Internet after DTCA exposure, using theories of planned behavior and self-efficacy. Methods: One thousand patients were randomly selected from 3,000 nationwide osteoarthritic patients. A self-administered survey examined predictors of intention including measurements of attitude toward behavior, subjective norm, perceived difficulty, self-efficacy, controllability, self-identity, intention, exposure to ads, and control variables. After 6 weeks, another survey measured respondents' information-seeking behavior. For patients exposed to DTCA, 6 multiple regressions were performed for information-seeking intention and behavior for 3 information sources: physicians, pharmacists, and the Internet. Results: The response rates were 61.9% and 80.1% for the first survey and the second survey, respectively. Four hundred and fifty-four participants reported exposure to DTCA about arthritis prescription medicines in the previous month. Over 41% of the variance in intention and over 18% of the variance in behavior were explained by the regression procedures. The consistent positive predictors of intention were attitude toward behavior, self-identity, attitude toward DTCAs of arthritis medication, and osteoarthritis pain; while the consistent positive predictors of behavior were intention and osteoarthritis pain. The strongest predictors of intention were self-identity for physicians, subjective norm for pharmacists, and attitude toward behavior for the Internet. Perceived difficulty and self-efficacy did not predict intention, and self-efficacy and controllability did not predict behavior. Conclusions: DTCA-prompted drug information-seeking may be under patients' complete volitional control. To promote information searching, efforts could be made to affect factors predicting intention.

144,2021,18254052,"Background: Depression is a highly prevalent disorder associated with reduced social functioning, impaired quality of life, and increased mortality. Music therapy has been used in the treatment of a variety of mental disorders, but its impact on those with depression is unclear. Objectives: To examine the efficacy of music therapy with standard care compared to standard care alone among people with depression and to compare the effects of music therapy for people with depression against other psychological or pharmacological therapies. Search strategy: CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References were searched on 7/11/2007, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, PsycLit, PSYindex, and other relevant sites were searched in November 2006. Reference lists of retrieved articles were hand searched, as well as specialist music and arts therapies journals. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials comparing music therapy with standard care or other interventions for depression. Data collection and analysis: Data on participants, interventions and outcomes were extracted and entered onto a database independently by two review authors. The methodological quality of each study was also assessed independently by two review authors. The primary outcome was reduction in symptoms of depression, based on a continuous scale. Main results: Five studies met the inclusion criteria of the review. Marked variations in the interventions offered and the populations studied meant that meta-analysis was not appropriate. Four of the five studies individually reported greater reduction in symptoms of depression among those randomised to music therapy than to those in standard care conditions. The fifth study, in which music therapy was used as an active control treatment, reported no significant change in mental state for music therapy compared with standard care. Dropout rates from music therapy conditions appeared to be low in all studies. Authors' conclusions: Findings from individual randomised trials suggest that music therapy is accepted by people with depression and is associated with improvements in mood. However, the small number and low methodological quality of studies mean that it is not possible to be confident about its effectiveness.

144,2021,26552929,"Background: Music therapy is a predominantly non-verbal psychotherapy based on music improvisation, embedded in a therapeutic relationship. This is the reason why music therapy is also used to treat depression. Aim: To examine the efficacy of music therapy and to report on the results of recent research into the value of music therapy as a treatment for depression. Method: We reviewed the literature on recent research into music therapy and depression, reporting on the methods used and the results achieved, and we assessed the current position of music therapy for depression in the context of evidence-based scientific research. Results: A wide variety of research methods was used to investigate the effects of using music therapy as a psychotherapy. Most studies focused usually on the added value that music therapy brings to the standard form of psychiatric treatment, when administered with or without psychopharmacological support. Music therapy produced particularly significant and favourable results when used to treat patients with depression. Conclusion: Current research into music therapy and depression points to a significant and persistent reduction in patients' symptoms and to improvements in their quality of life. However, further research is needed with regard to the best methods of illustrating the effects of music therapy.",Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,Can music therapy help manage depression?,0.9991163611412048
144,2021,18588701,"Background: Music therapy is frequently offered to individuals suffering from depression. Despite the lack of research into the effects of music therapy on this population, anecdotal evidence suggests that the results are rather promising. The aim of this study is to examine whether improvisational, psychodynamically orientated music therapy in an individual setting helps reduce symptoms of depression and improve other health-related outcomes. In particular, attention will be given to mediator agents, such as musical expression and interaction in the sessions, as well as to the explanatory potential of EEG recordings in investigating emotion related music perception of individuals with depression. Methods: 85 adults (18-50 years of age) with depression (ICD-10: F 32 or F33) will be randomly assigned to an experimental or a control condition. All participants will receive standard care, but the experimental group will be offered biweekly sessions of improvisational music therapy over a period of 3 months. A blind assessor will measure outcomes before testing, after 3 months, and after 6 months. Discussion: This study aims to fill a gap in knowledge as to whether active (improvisational) music therapy applied to people with depression improves their condition. For the first time in this context, the mediating processes, such as changes in musical expression and interaction during the course of therapy, will be objectively investigated, and it is expected that the results will provide new insights into these processes. Furthermore, the findings are expected to reveal whether music related emotional experiences, as measured by EEG, can be utilized in assessing a depressive client's improvement in the therapy. The size and the comprehensiveness of the study are sufficient for generalizing its findings to clinical practice as well as to further music therapy research.

144,2021,25060169,"According to the first publication in 1993 by Rauscher et al. [Nature 1993;365:611], the Mozart effect implies the enhancement of reasoning skills solving spatial problems in normal subjects after listening to Mozart's piano sonata K 448. A further evaluation of this effect has raised the question whether there is a link between music-generated emotions and a higher level of cognitive abilities by mere listening. Positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging have revealed that listening to pleasurable music activates cortical and subcortical cerebral areas where emotions are processed. These neurobiological effects of music suggest that auditory stimulation evokes emotions linked to heightened arousal and result in temporarily enhanced performance in many cognitive domains. Music therapy applies this arousal in a clinical setting as it may offer benefits to patients by diverting their attention from unpleasant experiences and future interventions. It has been applied in the context of various important clinical conditions such as cardiovascular disorders, cancer pain, epilepsy, depression and dementia. Furthermore, music may modulate the immune response, among other things, evidenced by increasing the activity of natural killer cells, lymphocytes and interferon-γ, which is an interesting feature as many diseases are related to a misbalanced immune system. Many of these clinical studies, however, suffer from methodological inadequacies. Nevertheless, at present, there is moderate but not altogether convincing evidence that listening to known and liked music helps to decrease the burden of a disease and enhances the immune system by modifying stress.",Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,Can music therapy help manage depression?,0.960140585899353
144,2021,27261995,"Objectives: To compare the effects of 1) active group music therapy and 2) receptive group music therapy to group counseling in treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Design &amp; setting: On top of standard care, 14 MDD outpatients were randomly assigned to receive 1) active group music therapy (n=5), 2) receptive group music therapy (n=5), or 3) group counseling (n=4). There were 12 one-hour weekly group sessions in each arm. Main outcome measures: Participants were assessed at baseline, 1 month (after 4 sessions), 3 months (end of interventions), and 6 months. Primary outcomes were depressive scores measured by Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Thai version. Secondary outcomes were self-rated depression score and quality of life. Results: At 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, both therapy groups showed statistically non-significant reduction in MADRS Thai scores when compared with the control group (group counseling). The reduction was slightly greater in the active group than the receptive group. Although there were trend toward better outcomes on self-report depression and quality of life, the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Group music therapy, either active or receptive, is an interesting adjunctive treatment option for outpatients with MDD. The receptive group may reach peak therapeutic effect faster, but the active group may have higher peak effect.

The aim of this study was to obtain estimates of effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids in BPD using meta-analysis, with a priori differentiation of affective, impulsive, and cognitive-perceptual symptom domains. Data sources: We performed a literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE, using terms related to BPD and omega-3 fatty acids. Publication date was not a restriction. Study selection: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared omega-3 fatty acids to placebo or any active comparator and pooled data using meta-analysis. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis, describing 4 RCTs testing effects of omega-3 fatty acids in 137 patients with BPD or BPD-related behavior. Data extraction: Using a pre-piloted data extraction form, we obtained data including intervention dose, duration, and BPD symptom scale scores, differentiating affective, impulsive, and cognitive-perceptual symptom domains. Results: Random effects meta-analysis showed an overall significant decreasing effect of omega-3 fatty acids on overall BPD symptom severity (0.54 standardized difference in means [SDM]; 95% CI = 0.91 to 0.17; Z = 2.87; P = .0041), without heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 0.00; Q = 2.63; P = .45).

In a previous 12-week randomized trial we assessed the efficacy of the combination of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with valproic acid, in comparison with valproic acid monotherapy, in 43 BPD outpatients. Combined therapy was superior to valproic acid monotherapy (the control group) in the treatment of some BPD symptoms: impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol, outbursts of anger, and self-harm. The present study is a 24-week follow-up aimed at evaluating whether the differences in efficacy between the two subgroups were maintained after discontinuation of omega-3 fatty acids. Methods: Thirty-four patients who completed the 12-week trial entered the follow-up study. Participants were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the follow-up period using the rating scales that showed a significant difference between the groups after the 12-week trial with fatty acids supplementation: the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI) (items 'impulsivity' and 'outbursts of anger'), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Version 11 (BIS-11), and Self Harm Inventory (SHI). Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Results: At the end of the follow-up a significant difference within groups was maintained for all four variables examined, while a significant difference between groups was maintained for outbursts of anger.

145,2021,17877810,"Background: A growing number of observational and epidemiological studies have suggested that mental illness, in particular mood disorders, is associated with reduced dietary intake and/or cellular abundance of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). This has prompted researchers to test the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA in a range of different psychiatric disorders. We have critically reviewed the double blind placebo controlled clinical trials published prior to April 2007 to determine whether omega-3 PUFA are likely to be efficacious in these disorders. Results: Most trials involved a small number of participants but were largely well designed. Omega-3 PUFA were well tolerated by both children and adults with mild gastrointestinal effects being the only consistently reported adverse event. For schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder we found little evidence of a robust clinically relevant effect. In the case of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and related disorders, most trials showed at most small benefits over placebo. A limited meta-analysis of these trials suggested that benefits of omega-3 PUFA supplementation may be greater in a classroom setting than at home. Some evidence indicates that omega-3 PUFA may reduce symptoms of anxiety although the data is preliminary and inconclusive. The most convincing evidence for beneficial effects of omega-3 PUFA is to be found in mood disorders. A meta-analysis of trials involving patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder provided evidence that omega-3 PUFA supplementation reduces symptoms of depression. Furthermore, meta-regression analysis suggests that supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid may be more beneficial in mood disorders than with docosahexaenoic acid, although several confounding factors prevented a definitive conclusion being made regarding which species of omega-3 PUFA is most beneficial. The mechanisms underlying the apparent efficacy of omega-3 PUFA in mood disorders compared to schizophrenia are discussed as is a rational for the possibly greater efficacy of EPA compared to DHA. Conclusion: While it is not currently possible to recommend omega-3 PUFA as either a mono- or adjunctive-therapy in any mental illness, the available evidence is strong enough to justify continued study, especially with regard to attentional, anxiety and mood disorders.",Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,omega 3 borderline personality disorder,1.0,Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,0.8287757635116577

Side effects were documented with the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser. Fatty acids in erythrocytes were analyzed using capillary gas chromatography. Results: At baseline, erythrocyte n-3 PUFA levels correlated positively with psychosocial functioning and negatively with psychopathology. By the end of the intervention, n-3 PUFAs significantly improved functioning and reduced psychiatric symptoms, compared with placebo. Side effects did not differ between the treatment groups.

Methods: English language literature cited in Medline and published between 1970 and 2006 was searched using the following terms: anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, benzodiazepines, borderline personality disorder, lithium, medication, mood stabilizers, pharmacotherapy, and psychotropics. Only reports of double-blind, randomized, controlled trials were included. Results: Twenty eight double-blind, randomized, controlled trials were identified which included anticonvulsants, classical neuroleptics, the benzodiazepine alprazolam, lithium, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, the novel antipsychotic olanzapine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and omega-3 fatty acids. All but three were placebo-controlled. With the exception of alprazolam and tricyclics, the data from these trials revealed evidence of improvements, although often circumscribed and variable. The novel antipsychotic olanzapine appeared to have the most empirical support for having a favorable effect on borderline personality disorder. Conclusion: A growing body of data suggests that there are psychotropic agents which appear to be well tolerated, and which to varying degrees may be expected to ameliorate the domains of psychopathology associated with borderline personality disorder.

It is postulated that a decrease in cathelicidin, a multifunctional host defense molecule, production due to low vit D status may predispose to infectious complications in children with asthma. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the association of vit D, vit D-binding protein (VDBP) and cathelicidin with acute asthma attacks among children with allergic asthma. Methods: This prospective study included 35 patients with acute asthma attack and 32 children with controlled asthma, and all were matched by sampling season, sensitization to mites, and previous severity of asthma. A comprehensive questionnaire about risk factors, blood sampling for 25-hydroxyvitamin D vit D, VDBP, and cathelicidin levels; spirometric indices were used. Factors that influence serum vit D and cathelicidin levels and the development of asthma attacks were evaluated with multivariate analysis. Results: The mean serum vit D levels of the attack group was significantly lower than that of the controlled asthma group (p 0.001). The mean cathelicidin level was significantly higher in the acute asthma group than with the controlled subjects with asthma (p = 0.002). There was no difference between the acute and controlled asthma groups in terms of markers of allergy and serum VDBP levels. Risk factors that may influence vit D levels revealed that body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.038), duration of sun exposure (p 0.001), and amount of dietary vit D (p 0.001) independently affected serum vit D levels. Risk factors that may result in acute asthma showed that low serum levels of vit D were significantly related to the risk of asthma attacks (p 0.001, adjusted odds ratio 16.11). Cathelicidin levels showed a significant positive association with asthma attacks and BMI.

146,2021,34462708,"Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It presents with reversible bronchoconstriction that makes it difficult for patients to breathe. Asthma flare-ups have several triggers, but the symptoms are similar, including wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Severe asthma exacerbation is described as symptomatic asthma that is unresponsive to inhaled asthma medications and is only responsive to steroids in oral or intravenous forms. Asthma-related deaths occur during episodes of asthma exacerbation. Vitamin D is a steroid-derived vitamin produced by the body and found in some foods. Administration of doses of vitamin D can also help maintain an adequate level of the vitamin. Vitamin D plays a vital role in regulating the level of calcium in the body and bone remodeling processes. It also has an immunomodulatory effect on innate and adaptive immunity within the body and that partially explains its links to inflammation-induced epithelial changes seen in asthma. We conducted this literature review by selecting articles from PubMed and Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus databases to investigate the relationship between vitamin D level and asthma exacerbation. From the studies, we found that asthmatic patients have low vitamin D levels during an asthma exacerbation.

146,2021,31278171,"Introduction: Vitamin D is best known for its role in bone health; however, the discovery of the vitamin D receptor and the expression of the gene encoding the vitamin D 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) enzyme in a wide variety of tissues including immune cells and respiratory epithelium has led to the discovery of potential roles for vitamin D in the prevention of acute wheeze. Methods: We review here the literature concerning the relationships between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration and secondary prevention of acute wheeze attacks in preschool and school-age children. Results: Epidemiological data suggest that vitamin D insufficiency (25(OH)D 75 nmol/L) is highly prevalent in preschool and school-age children with wheeze. Preschool age children with a history of wheeze attacks and circulating 25(OH)D 75 nmol/L are at increased risk and frequency of future acute wheeze. However, no consistent association between low vitamin D status and risk of acute wheeze is reported in school-age children. Seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with relatively small sample sizes (30-430) and variable quality showed inconsistent results regarding the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation during childhood on the risk of asthma attacks, asthma symptom control, inhaled corticosteroid requirements, spirometry and unscheduled healthcare attendances for wheeze. A RCT showed that vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the frequency of unplanned healthcare attendances due to acute wheeze in 22 preschool children. Discussion: An evidence-based recommendation for the use of vitamin D as a preventive therapy for wheeze attacks cannot be made until results of further trials are available. The assessment of circulating 25(OH)D concentration and the optimisation of vitamin D status to prevent acute respiratory tract infections, and to maintain skeletal and general health in preschool and school-age children with acute wheeze is worthwhile in its own right, but whether this will reduce the risk of acute wheeze attacks is unclear.",Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,vitamin d asthma attacks,1.0,Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,0.30633074045181274
146,2021,27714929,"Vitamin D, in addition to its classical functions in bone homeostasis, has a modulatory and regulatory role in multiple processes, including host defense, inflammation, immunity, and epithelial repair. Patients with respiratory disease are frequently deficient in vitamin D, implying that supplementation might provide significant benefit to these patients. Respiratory viral infections are common and are the main trigger of acute exacerbations and hospitalization in children and adults with asthma and other airways diseases. Respiratory monocytes/macrophages and epithelial cells constitutively express the vitamin D receptor. Vitamin D, acting through this receptor, may be important in protection against respiratory infections. Whether the in vitro findings can be translated into a substantial in vivo benefit still remains uncertain. Here we review the in vitro data on the role of vitamin D in antiviral innate immunity, the data concerning the deficient levels of vitamin D in lung diseases, and the in vivo role of supplementation as protection against respiratory viral infections in healthy individuals and in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Finally, we suggest ways of improving the effectiveness of vitamin D as an adjuvant in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory infections.",Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,vitamin d asthma attacks,1.0,Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,0.9599535465240479
146,2021,35141325,"Background: There is conflicting evidence for vitamin D supplementation in childhood asthma. We aimed to systematically synthesise the evidence on the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation in childhood asthma. Methods: We searched electronic databases (Medline, Embase and Web of Science) and a register (CENTRAL) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published until 30 September 2021. RCTs enrolling asthmatic children (1-18 years old) and comparing vitamin D against placebo/routine care were included if they met at least one of the endpoints of interest (asthma attacks, emergency visits or hospitalisation). We used the Risk of Bias 2 tool for risk of bias assessment. Random-effects meta-analysis with RevMan 5.3 software was performed. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to assess the level of certainty of the evidence. Results: 18 RCTs (1579 participants) were included. The pooled meta-analysis did not find a significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on asthma attacks requiring rescue systemic corticosteroids (six studies with 445 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% CI 0.86-1.48; I<sup>2</sup>=0%) (moderate-certainty evidence). In addition, there was no significant difference in the proportion of children with asthma attacks of any severity (11 trials with 1132 participants; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65-1.09; I<sup>2</sup>=58%) (very low-certainty evidence). Vitamin D does not reduce the need for emergency visits (three studies with 361 participants; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89-1.07; I<sup>2</sup>=0%) and hospitalisation (RR: 1.38, 95% CI 0.52-3.66; I<sup>2</sup>=0%) (low-certainty evidence).

146,2021,29399078,"The aim of the present study was to analyze the correlation between the vitamin D (VitD) levels and asthma attack in children, and to evaluate the effects of combination therapy of atomization inhalation of budesonide, albuterol and VitD supplementation on asthmatic children. The total sample size comprised of 96 children with asthma from the time period between May 2015 to April 2016. At the same time, 96 healthy children were also selected from the physical examination center for comparison study. The levels of serum VitD in both groups were detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pulmonary function index that includes the measurement of FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, MEF25 and MEF50 were performed to analyze the results. The patients in the control group were treated with only the budesonide therapy and the patients in the observation group were treated with atomization inhalation of budesonide combined with salbutamol and VitD supplementation. After the treatment, the levels of inflammatory cell indicators (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IFN-γ) and pulmonary function in the two groups were compared. The levels of serum VitD in the children with asthma were significantly lower than those in the normal children. The serum IgE level in children with asthma was significantly higher than that in the normal children (P 0.05). Pearson correlation coefficient analyses showed that VitD levels were not correlated with FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC levels (P&gt;0.05), but was positively correlated with MEF25 and MEF50 (P 0.05). After the treatment, the levels of IL-2 and IFN-γ in the observation group were significantly higher and levels of IL-4 and IL-6 were significantly lower than those in the control group (P 0.05). The pulmonary function (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, MEF25 and MEF50) of the observation group was better than that of the control group (P 0.05). The serum VitD levels of children with asthma were closely related to the acute asthmatic attacks. The lower the levels of serum VitD further leads to higher possibility of asthmatic attacks.

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association of innate and adaptive immunity with acute asthma attacks by analysing the role of IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D and cytokines. Material and methods: This prospective study included 33 patients with viral-induced acute asthma and 30 children with controlled asthma. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected for virus identification and asthma attack scores assessed in acute asthma group. Blood sampling for IP-10, TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D levels, and spirometric indices were employed. Results: Serum IP-10 and cathelicidin levels of acute asthma group were significantly higher and vitamin D levels were lower than controlled asthma group (IP-10; p=0.006, cathelicidin; p=0.002, vitamin D; p 0.001). Serum IP-10 levels showed a significant negative correlation with age (p=0.009), TLR2 (p=0.05) and spirometric indices (p=0.002) in all asthmatics and a significant positive correlation with parameters of asthma attack severity (p=0.03) in acute asthma group. Higher cathelicidin values showed significant positive relation to IP-10 (beta coefficient: 33, p=0.02). Serum IP-10 levels higher than 38.9pg/ml (sensitivity: 85%, specificity: 47%, p=0.002) were predictive of virus-induced asthma. Serum IP-10 and vitamin D levels were found to be significantly related to viral-asthma attacks (IP-10; aOR: 8.93, p=0.03 and vitamin D; aOR: 0.82, p=0.001). Conclusions: Innate immunity biomarkers such as serum IP-10 and cathelicidin can be used to predict viral-induced acute asthma.

Soy based formulas have been used to treat infants with allergy or food intolerance. However, it is unclear whether they can be advocated for the prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants without clinical evidence of allergy or food intolerance. Objectives: In infants without clinical evidence of allergy or food intolerance, to determine whether feeding them an adapted soy formula compared to human milk, cow's milk formula or a hydrolysed protein formula prevents allergy or food intolerance. Search strategy: The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used including searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 - January 2004), EMBASE (1980 - January 2004), CINAHL (1982 - December 2003) and previous reviews including cross references. Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compare the use of an adapted soy formula to human milk, an adapted cow's milk or a hydrolysed protein formula for infant feeding in the first 6 months. Only trials with &gt; 80% follow up of participants and reported in group of assignment were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Eligibility of studies for inclusion, methodological quality and data extraction were assessed independently by each reviewer. Primary outcomes included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food intolerance. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed effects model where no heterogeneity of treatment effect existed, and a random effects model when heterogeneity was found. Main results: Five eligible studies were found, all enrolling infants at high risk of allergy on the basis of a family history of allergy in a first degree relative. All studies compared use of a soy to a cow's milk formula. Two studies also included a group fed a formula containing hydrolysed protein. No eligible study enrolled infants fed human milk. No study examined the effect of early, short term soy formula feeding. Three studies were of good methodology and did not have unbalanced allergy-preventing co-interventions in the treatment groups. Comparing soy to cow's milk formula, one study with unclear allocation concealment and 19.5% losses to follow up reported a reduction in cumulative incidence of childhood allergy, asthma and allergic rhinitis. No other study reported a significant benefit for any allergy or food intolerance. Analysis found no significant difference in allergy cumulative incidence in infancy (one study: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.69, 1.49) or childhood (3 studies: typical RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37, 1.44) and no significant difference in cumulative incidence or period prevalence of any specific allergy or food intolerance in infancy or childhood.

147,2021,21792544,"Adverse reactions to foods are extremely common, and generally they are attributed to allergy. However, clinical manifestations of various degrees of severity related to ingestion of foods can arise as a result of a number of disorders, only some of which can be defined as allergic, implying an immune mechanism. Recent epidemiological data in North America showed that the prevalence of food allergy in children has increased. The most common food allergens in the United States include egg, milk, peanut, tree nuts, wheat, crustacean shellfish, and soy. This review examines the various forms of food intolerances (immunoglobulin E [IgE] and non-IgE mediated), including celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Immune mediated reactions can be either IgE mediated or non-IgE mediated. Among the first group, Immediate GI hypersensitivity and oral allergy syndrome are the best described. Often, but not always, IgE-mediated food allergies are entities such as eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic gastroenteropathy. Non IgE-mediated immune mediated food reactions include celiac disease and gluten sensitivity, two increasingly recognized disorders.

147,2021,33749178,"The effect of the pregnant mother's nutrition and the effect of the baby's nutrition during the first-year on the development of allergy and atopic disease in the baby have been studied extensively in recent years. Key recommendations for healthcare bodies in Europe and the United States include: • Allergy prevention in at-risk infants (parent or sibling with allergy): Currently, there is a consensus of healthcare organizations around the world that the recommended exclusive breastfeeding duration is the first 6 months of life for the overall health benefit of the baby. Allergy prevention in non-breastfed infants at risk: There are studies showing that fully hydrolyzed formula can reduce the risk of allergic reactions, especially atopic dermatitis, in high-risk non-breastfed babies. Some recommendations for high-risk non-breastfed infants support feeding up to 4 to 6 months with hydrolyzed formulas. Further research is needed on this subject. Soy formulas failed to prevent allergy in high-risk infants. • In case of cow's milk allergy symptoms in breastfed babies: Although a small amount of food allergens may be present in the milk, mothers should be encouraged to continue breastfeeding while avoiding consumption of cow's milk and products. • In case of cow's milk allergy symptoms in non-breastfed babies: Under six months of age, extensively hydrolyzed formula is suitable for most cases of cow's milk allergy, except for severe clinical conditions, which require amino acid formulas. Over six months, soy formulas can be considered. Exposure to solid foods: The current recommendations are to start on solids at the age of 4-6 months and there is no recommendation for avoiding known allergens, despite family history. Later introduction of peanut, fish or egg does not prevent, and may even increase, the risk of developing food allergy.

147,2021,24504215,"Due to the recent exponential increase in food allergies and atopic disorders, effective allergy prevention has become a public health priority in many developed regions. Important preventive strategies include the promotion of breastfeeding and vaginal deliveries, judicious use of perinatal antibiotics, as well as the avoidance of maternal tobacco smoking. Breastfeeding for at least 6 months and introduction of complementary solids from 4-6 months are generally recommended. Complex oligosaccharides in breast milk support the establishment of bifidobacteria in the neonatal gut which stimulate regulatory T lymphocyte responses and enhance tolerance development. Maternal elimination diets during pregnancy or lactation are not effective in preventing allergies. If exclusive breastfeeding is not possible, (supplemental) feeding with a partially hydrolyzed whey-based formula or extensively hydrolyzed casein-based formula may reduce the risk of cow's milk allergy and atopic dermatitis in infants with a family history of atopy. By contrast, asthma and allergic rhinitis at 4-6 years of age are not prevented by this approach. Soy formula and amino acid-based formula have no proven role in allergy prevention. Perinatal supplementation with probiotics and/or prebiotics may reduce the risk of atopic dermatitis, but no reliable effect on the prevention of food allergy or respiratory allergies has so far been found. A randomized trial on maternal fish oil supplementation during pregnancy found that atopic dermatitis and egg sensitization in the first year of life were significantly reduced, but no preventive effect for food allergies was demonstrated.

147,2021,22872103,"Soybean products (soyfoods), reported as potential functional foods, are implicated in several health-enhancing properties, such as easing the symptoms of postmenopausal women, reducing the risk of osteoporosis, preventing cardiovascular disease, and antimutagenic effects. Isoflavone, for example, is one of the most important compounds abundantly found in soybean, mainly accounting for the health-enhancing properties as mentioned earlier. However, most biological activities of isoflavones are mainly attributed to their aglycone forms. It has also been demonstrated that isoflavone aglycones are absorbed faster and in greater amount than their glycosides in human intestines. Fortunately, deglycosylation of isoflavones can be achieved during fermentation process by several strains such as lactic acid bacteria, basidiomycetes, filamentous fungus, and Bacillus subtilis with their β-glucosidase activity. This article presents an overview of soybean's chemistry, application, state-of-the-art advances in soybean fermentation processing and products as well as their applications in food and pharmaceutical industries.

147,2021,25257836,"This review summarizes current evidence and recommendations regarding cow's milk allergy (CMA), the most common food allergy in young children, for the primary and secondary care providers. The diagnostic approach includes performing a medical history, physical examination, diagnostic elimination diets, skin prick tests, specific IgE measurements, and oral food challenges. Strict avoidance of the offending allergen is the only therapeutic option. Oral immunotherapy is being studied, but it is not yet recommended for routine clinical practice. For primary prevention of allergy, exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 months and up to 6 months is desirable. Infants with a documented hereditary risk of allergy (i.e., an affected parent and/or sibling) who cannot be breastfed exclusively should receive a formula with confirmed reduced allergenicity, i.e., a partially or extensively hydrolyzed formula, as a means of preventing allergic reactions, primarily atopic dermatitis. Avoidance or delayed introduction of solid foods beyond 4-6 months for allergy prevention is not recommended. Conclusion: For all of those involved in taking care of children's health, it is important to understand the multifaceted aspects of CMA, such as its epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, and dietary management, as well as its primary prevention.",Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,baby soy formula prevent allergies,0.0,Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,0.7676717638969421
147,2021,24229819,"With the rising prevalence of atopic disease, primary prevention may play a role in reducing its burden, especially in high-risk infants. With this in mind, the Adverse Reactions to Foods Committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology was charged with the task of developing recommendations for primary care physicians and specialists about the primary prevention of allergic disease through nutritional interventions according to current available literature and expert opinion. Recommendations that are supported by data are as follows. Avoidance diets during pregnancy and lactation are not recommended at this time, but more research is necessary for peanut. Exclusive breast-feeding for at least 4 and up to 6 months is endorsed. For high-risk infants who cannot be exclusively breast-fed, hydrolyzed formula appears to offer advantages to prevent allergic disease and cow's milk allergy. Complementary foods can be introduced between 4 and 6 months of age. Because no formal recommendations have been previously provided about how and when to introduce the main allergenic foods (cow's milk, egg, soy, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, fish, shellfish), these are now provided, and reasons to consider allergy consultation for development of a personalized plan for food introduction are also presented.",Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,baby soy formula prevent allergies,0.0,Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,0.999651312828064
147,2021,22237876,"For many years, the prevailing maxim for prevention of food allergy in at-risk infants was to reduce allergic sensitization by avoiding exposure to highly allergenic foods until the baby's immune and digestive systems were sufficiently developed to cope with the allergen. Current thinking is completely different: exposure to food in the early stages of development may be the way to induce tolerance. Exclusive breastfeeding until 4-6 months, followed by introduction of complementary foods individually, is recommended. Any restrictions on mother's diet, other than avoidance of her own allergens during pregnancy and breastfeeding, are contraindicated. If a baby at high risk for allergy (defined as having 1 first-degree relative with diagnosed allergy) cannot be exclusively breastfed to 4-6 months of age, the preferred method of feeding for the prevention of atopic disease is an extensively hydrolyzed formula. There appears to be no value in delaying the introduction of any food beyond 6 months of age. Most food allergy is outgrown in childhood, but allergy to some foods tends to persist. Induction of tolerance to foods to which a child is allergic may be achieved by low-dose exposure in a process known as specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI).

The pATC grafted chitosan films showed lower thermal stability, water absorption, swelling ratio, and tensile strength compared to the unmodified chitosan film. Antimicrobial activity of the quaternized chitosan was tested against three kinds of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two fungi (Aspergillus brasiliensis and Aspergillus fumigatus). The unmodified chitosan showed good antibacterial activity but no resistance against any fungus. However, the pATC grafted chitosan showed enhanced antibacterial activity against all bacteria investigated. The fungicidal test shows that the pATC-grafted-chitosan showed higher activity against the tested fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus brasiliensis) compared to the unmodified chitosan, especially against Aspergillus fumigatus.",Does chitosan help lose body weight?,chitosan weight loss,0.0,Does chitosan help lose body weight?,0.9920016527175903
148,2021,34000306,"Contamination of water with the copper(II) ions leads to serious diseases such as liver damage and cancer. This deadly effect prompted us to target the synthesis of a novel functionalized chitosan (Cs-BT) to be used as an adsorbent for removing the copper(II) ions from the aqueous solution. The functionalization was done by introducing benzothiazole moiety into the chitosan (Cs) chain and confirmed by the full disappearance of the NH 2 band in the FT-IR spectrum of the adsorbent. The TGA-DTG analysis revealed that the functionalization reduced the thermal stability of the adsorbent (Cs-BT) as compared with pure chitosan. The adsorption was evidenced by SEM and EDX analysis. The adsorption study demonstrated that the optimal adsorption conditions were 120 min contact time, pH = 6, and initial Cu(II) concentration 200 mg/L. At these conditions, the Cs-BT achieved a maximum copper adsorption capacity of 1439.7 mg/g. Consequently, Cs-BT could be a promising and efficient Cu adsorbent in water treatment. Study the adsorption kinetics and isotherms manifested that the pseudo-first-order was better than pseudo-second-order and Temkin isotherm was better than Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich for explaining the adsorption process.

148,2021,26747458,"Background: Chitosan is a dietary fibre which acts by reducing fat absorption and thus used as a means for controlling weight. Weight loss clinical trial outcomes, however, have contradictory results regarding its efficacy. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a chitosan from fungal origin in treatment of excess weight in the absence of dietary restrictions. Methods: A phase IV, randomised, multicentre, single-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study was conducted by administering chitosan capsules (500 mg, five/day) and indistinguishable placebo capsules as daily supplements to 96 overweight and obese subjects for 90 days. The study participants were divided in 2:1 ratio to receive either chitosan (n = 64) or placebo (n = 32). Efficacy was assessed by measuring body weight, body composition parameters, anthropometric measurements, HbA1C level and lipid profile at day 45 and day 90. Also, short form-36 quality of life (QoL) questionnaire was assessed to evaluate improvement in life-style and dietary habits were recorded for calorie intake. Safety was assessed by evaluating safety parameters and monitoring adverse events. Results: The mean changes in body weight were -1.78 ± 1.37 kg and -3.10 ± 1.95 kg at day 45 and day 90 respectively in chitosan group which were significantly different (p 0.0001) as compared to placebo. BMI was decreased by10.91 fold compared to placebo after 90 day administration. In concert with this, there was also reduction in body composition and anthropometric parameters together with improvement in QoL score. Chitosan was also able to reduce HbA1C levels (below 6 %) in subjects who had initial higher values. The mean caloric intake shows that there was no change in dietary habits of subjects in both groups. Lipid levels were unaffected and all adverse events were mild in nature and unrelated to study treatment. Conclusion: Chitosan from fungal origin was able to reduce the mean body weight up to 3 kg during the 90 day study period. Together with this, there was also improvement in body composition, anthropometric parameters and HbA1C, reflecting overall benefits for the overweight individuals. Additionally, there was also improvement in QoL score. It was safe and well tolerated by all subjects.

149,2021,25622524,"Background: Early-onset hip osteoarthritis is commonly seen in people undergoing hip arthroscopy and is associated with increased pain, reduced ability to participate in physical activity, reduced quality of life and reduced range of motion and muscle strength. Despite this, the efficacy of non-surgical interventions such as exercise therapies remains unknown. The primary aim is to establish the feasibility of a phase III randomised controlled trial investigating a targeted physiotherapy intervention for people with early-onset hip osteoarthritis. The secondary aims are to determine the size of treatment effects of a physiotherapy intervention, targeted to improve hip joint range and hip-related symptoms in early-onset hip osteoarthritis following hip arthroscopy, compared to a health-education control. Methods: This protocol describes a randomised, assessor- and participant-blind, controlled clinical trial. We will include 20 participants who are (i) aged between 18 and 50 years; (ii) have undergone hip arthroscopy during the past six to 12 months; (iii) have early-onset hip osteoarthritis (defined as chondrolabral pathology) at the time of hip arthroscopy; and (iv) experience hip-related pain during activities. Primary outcome will be the feasibility of a phase III clinical trial. Secondary outcomes will be (i) perceived global change score; (ii) hip-related symptoms (measured using the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) pain subscale, activity subscale, and sport and recreation subscale); (iii) hip quality of life (measured using the HOOS quality of life subscale and International Hip Outcome tool; (iv) hip muscle strength and (v) hip range of motion. The physiotherapy intervention is semi-standardised, including joint and soft tissue mobilisation and stretching, hip and trunk muscle retraining and functional and activity-specific retraining and education. The control intervention encompasses individualised health education, with the same frequency and duration as the intervention. The trial primary end-point is the conclusion of the 12-week intervention, and follow-up measures will be collected at the 12-week post-baseline assessment. Discussion: The findings of this study will provide guidance regarding the feasibility of a full-scale phase III randomised controlled trial, prior to its undertaking.

149,2021,35694906,"Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of pericapsular soft tissue and realignment (PSTR) exercises for patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and Harris Hip Score (HHS) below 60 points. Most previous studies of hip exercise have not been applied for patients with moderate to severe hip OA, especially those with an HHS below 60 points. Most studies of hip exercise in OA have involved muscle strength training, stretching, functional training and aerobic fitness programs, and have not included pelvic realignment exercise. We investigated the effect of pelvic realignment exercise for patients with hip OA and HHS below 60 points. Methods: Design: multicenter, prospective, observational, single-arm study. Setting: clinical examination on an outpatient basis. Participants: 193 patients with hip OA and HHS below 60 points. Interventions: patient education and supervised PSTR exercises. Outcome measures: primary outcome: HHS; secondary outcomes: changes in numerical rating scale (NRS) scores, abduction of range of motion, Timed Up and Go (TUG) test within 30 min after PSTR exercises at baseline and other six items, full analysis set (FAS, all participants who performed PSTR exercises) and subgroup analysis (participants with minimal joint space (MJS) of 0 mm at baseline). Results: FAS analysis ( N = 193): significant differences in HHS were found between baseline and 3 month follow-up, and between baseline and 6 month follow-up in the Unilateral and Bilateral OA groups ( p .001). All mean differences were within the 95% confidence interval. Significant improvement in NRS scores, abduction of range of motion, and TUG test within 30 min after PSTR exercises were found at baseline ( p .001). Subgroup analysis ( N = 130): the results revealed significant differences ( p .001) in HHS and NRS, abduction of range of motion and TUG test within 30 min after PSTR exercises at baseline, as in the FAS analysis. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that PSTR exercises were effective for patients with HHS below 60 points, even those with MJS of 0 mm.

Thirty-six hip patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) and/or total hip replacement in at least one hip joint were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG). IG (18 patients, mean age 64.9, standard deviation (SD) 7.5) followed an 8-week PHSEP in addition to their weekly institutional exercise therapy, while CG (18 patients, mean age 64.7, SD 9) solely continued the weekly institutional exercise sessions. Before and after the intervention period, strength of hip muscles was quantified applying isokinetic concentric and isometric measurements, and health-related quality of life was monitored using the SF36 questionnaire. Adherence to the exercise program was evaluated using exercise logs. The PHSEP was feasible for all subjects in IG with an adherence of 99%. Exercise logs reported that pain resulting from the PHSEP was low. Increased strength in isokinetic concentric hip adduction (13%) and isometric hip abduction (9%), adduction (12%), and flexion (7%) was found in IG in comparison to CG. The results of the SF36 did not change during the intervention period. Consequently, supervised institutional exercise therapy supplemented by a PHSEP could increase hip muscle strength in patients with hip OA and/or total hip replacement.

Whilst there is a substantial body of literature surrounding osteoarthritis of the knee, there is less reported research on the hip joint, especially pertaining to physiotherapy intervention. This descriptive study aimed to describe current physiotherapy management of osteoarthritis of the hip by Australian physiotherapists in private practice and acute hospital settings. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Participants: A questionnaire was administered to 364 public and private practitioners in the state of Victoria. Results: A response rate of 66% was achieved. Physiotherapists working in the private and public sectors reported frequent use of manual therapy (78% and 87%, respectively), aquatic therapy (82% and 58%, respectively) and home exercise programmes (88% and 80%, respectively). Class-based physiotherapy is employed less frequently (44% and 28%, respectively). Strengthening exercises are the most common treatment technique. Conclusions: The widespread use of exercise and manual therapy in the management of osteoarthritis of the hip is highlighted.

However, its efficacy for improving hip pain in patients with hip osteoarthritis remains unclear. Objective: To investigate the effects of foam rolling on hip pain in patients with hip osteoarthritis. Methods: In this retrospective propensity-matched cohort study, medical records of outpatients between January 2017 and March 2019 were reviewed. Of these, 115 patients with hip osteoarthritis were divided into foam rolling or non-foam rolling groups based on home exercises. Both groups were propensity-score matched (1:1) for age, sex, body mass index, Kellgren and Lawrence grade, and visual analog scale (VAS) of hip pain at baseline. The primary outcome was the hip pain-VAS. Effects of interventions on the hip pain-VAS were examined using a split-plot design variance analysis. Results: After matching, both groups comprised 37 patients each. No significant differences were observed in baseline characteristics and outcome measurements between the matched groups.

Preliminary results of the Cycling against Hip Pain programme found significant improvements in clinical and patient-reported outcome measures for patients referred from primary care. This article evaluates the effectiveness of the changes made to the pathway in a quality improvement replication programme. Methods: The replicated Cycling against Hip Pain programme was delivered between February 2018 and September 2019 in a region of England with a high percentage of adults aged over 65 years. All participants were referred from the orthopaedic outpatient department of the funding hospital (secondary care). The programme was delivered at a local leisure centre and combined 30 min of education on osteoarthritis with 30 min of progressive static cycling, once a week for 6 weeks. Results: The participants on the replicated Cycling against Hip Pain programme did not differ from the original cohort in terms of age or pre-programme weight, however, presented with worse hip symptoms at baseline. Consistent with the findings from the original cohort, participants demonstrated significant improvements to their Oxford Hip Score, 30-s chair stand performance, Timed Up and Go score, Hip Osteoarthritis Outcome Score function and pain, EQ5D health rating, EQ5D-5L score and pain at rest and on weight bearing. In addition, participants reported an increase in knowledge, confidence and motivation to exercise. Conclusion: A 6-week cycling and education intervention for the treatment of hip osteoarthritis provided benefits to function, pain and quality of life for patients referred from secondary care.

149,2021,32151918,"Background: Hip osteoarthritis is a major musculoskeletal disorder in the elderly. Evidence is given for the efficacy of exercise interventions in terms of self-reported physical functioning and pain. However, it has not yet been fully examined whether exercises influence gait. Research question: The purpose of this RCT therefore was to evaluate effects of a 12-week exercise program on kinematic gait variables in subjects with hip osteoarthritis. Methods: 210 participants were randomly assigned to exercise, non-treated control, or placebo ultrasound groups. The 12-week exercise intervention combined a weekly group session with home-based exercises (2/week), which entailed exercises for motor learning, flexibility, strengthening, and balance. Placebo ultrasound was given once a week. A 6-camera motion capture system was used for data collection. Data were derived from shod walking at self-selected speeds. Spatio-temporal and hip and knee joint angles of the stance phase were calculated. Data were averaged across five trials. Measurements were taken prior to and immediately after the intervention period. ANOVA/Kruskall-Wallis-Tests were used to analyze between-group effects for differences between test days. Pairwise comparisons were subsequently conducted in case of significant model effects. Data were analyzed per protocol (n = 185). Results: No statistically significant differences were detected for any of the outcome measures. Significance: Although hip muscle strength and gait quality are related, strength training of the hip-surrounding musculature without specific gait training elements cannot improve spatio-temporal gait characteristics or hip and knee joint angles in subjects with mild to moderate hip osteoarthritis.

The main content of tobacco smoke is nicotine and its metabolite cotinine. These compounds can pass the blood-testis barrier, which subsequently causes harm of diverse degree to the germ cells. Although controversial, smoking has been shown to cause not only a decrease in sperm motility, sperm concentration, and an increase in abnormal sperm morphology, but also genetic and epigenetic aberrations in spermatozoa. Both animal and human studies have highlighted the occurrence of sperm DNA-strand breaks (fragmentation), genome instability, genetic mutations, and the presence of aneuploids in the germline of animals and men exposed to tobacco smoke. The question to be asked at this point is, if smoking has the potential to cause all these genetic aberrations, what is the extent of damage? Hence, this review aimed to provide evidence that smoking has a mutagenic effect on sperm and how this subsequently affects male fertility.

In obese individuals, disorders on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis are observed, as well as elevated oestrogen levels with a simultaneous decrease in testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. Healthy dietary models clearly correlate with better sperm quality and a smaller risk of abnormalities in parameters such as sperm count, sperm concentration and motility, and lower sperm DNA fragmentation. Apart from mineral components such as zinc and selenium, the role of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidant vitamins should be emphasized, since their action will be primarily based on the minimization of oxidative stress and the inflammation process. Additionally, the incorporation of carnitine supplements and coenzyme Q10 in therapeutic interventions also seems promising. Therefore, it is advisable to have a varied and balanced diet based on vegetables and fruit, fish and seafood, nuts, seeds, whole-grain products, poultry, and low-fat dairy products.",Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,antioxidant supplements fertility,0.0,Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,0.8087001442909241

High levels of semen ROS can cause sperm dysfunction, sperm DNA damage and reduced male reproductive potential. This observation has led clinicians to treat infertile men with antioxidant supplements. The purpose of this article is to discuss the rationale for antioxidant therapy in infertile men and to evaluate the data on the efficacy of dietary and in vitro antioxidant preparations on sperm function and DNA damage. To date, most clinical studies suggest that dietary antioxidant supplements are beneficial in terms of improving sperm function and DNA integrity. However, the exact mechanism of action of dietary antioxidants and the optimal dietary supplement have not been established. Moreover, most of the clinical studies are small and few have evaluated pregnancy rates. A beneficial effect of in vitro antioxidant supplements in protecting spermatozoa from exogenous oxidants has been demonstrated in most studies; however, the effect of these antioxidants in protecting sperm from endogenous ROS, gentle sperm processing and cryopreservation has not been established conclusively.",Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,antioxidant supplements fertility,0.0,Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,0.9995037317276001

Thus, although spontaneous fertility can occur, the majority of females with BTM is infertile due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and need assisted reproductive techniques. Infertility in these women seems to be attributed to iron deposition and iron-induced oxidative stress (OS) in various endocrine organs, such as hypothalamus, pituitary, and female reproductive system, but also through the iron effect on other organs, such as liver and pancreas, contributing to the impaired metabolism of hormones and serum antioxidants. Nevertheless, the gonadal function of these patients is usually intact and fertility is usually retrievable. Meanwhile, a significant prooxidants/antioxidants imbalance with subsequent increased (OS) exists in patients with BTM, which is mainly caused by tissue injury due to overproduction of free radicals by secondary iron overload, but also due to alteration in serum trace elements and antioxidant enzymes. Not only using the appropriate antioxidants, essential trace elements, and minerals, but also regulating the advanced glycation end products, could probably reduce the extent of oxidative damage and related complications and retrieve BTM women's infertility.",Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,antioxidant supplements fertility,0.0,Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,0.9993232488632202

Even though it has been shown to be a worldwide problem, this decrease is more pronounced in developed and industrialized countries, pointing to changes in modifiable lifestyle factors (e.g. unhealthy diets, lifestyles, and pollution) as the main causes. Studies investigating the relation between diet and semen quality can be classified into three groups; studies assessing the association between semen quality and 1) nutrients, dietary supplements and antioxidants, 2) food, and 3) dietary patterns. The present narrative review provides a wide-ranging vision of the positive associations and effects of diet on sperm quality. Although the picture of the relationship between diet and sperm quality and fertility is far from complete, a number of broad conclusions have emerged. First, increased intake of selenium and zinc, omega-3 (ω-3) fatty acids, CoenzymeQ10 (CoQ10) and carnitine supplements have been positively related to sperm quality. In terms of food groups, vegetables, fruits, nuts and whole cereals, all rich in fiber and antioxidants, and fish, seafood, shellfish, poultry, and low-fat dairy products have been positively associated with sperm quality.

A considerable body of recent studies indicates that lifestyle as well as environmental and psychological factors can negatively affect male fertility, more than previously thought. These negative effects have been shown in many cases to be reversible. This review aims to provide a rationale for early clinical attention to these factors and presents a non-exhaustive evidence-based collection of primary relevant conditions and recommendations, specifically with a view to making first line diagnostics and recommendations. The presently available evidence suggests that considering the high cost, success rates, and possible side effects of assisted reproduction techniques (ART), such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), early efforts to improve male fertility appear to be an attainable and worthwhile primary goal.

Inspired by the "" signatura rerum "" principle and an apparent ancient folk tradition, various indications were given, such as anti-jaundice and cholagogue, pain-relieving, and quite often mentioned-ophthalmological problems. Central and Eastern European folk medicine has always been using this herb extensively. In this region, the plant is known under many unique vernacular names, especially in Slavonic languages, associated or not with old Greek relation to ""chelidon""-the swallow. Typically for Papaveroidae subfamily, yellow-colored latex is produced in abundance and leaks intensely upon injury. Major pharmacologically relevant components, most of which were first isolated over a century ago, are isoquinoline alkaloids-berberine, chelerythrine, chelidonine, coptisine, sanguinarine. Modern pharmacology took interest in this herb but it has not ended up in gaining an officially approved and evidence-based herbal medicine status. On the contrary, the number of relevant studies and publications tended to drop. Recently, some controversial reports and sometimes insufficiently proven studies appeared, suggesting anticancer properties. Anticancer potential was in line with anecdotical knowledge spread in East European countries, however, in the absence of directly-acting cytostatic compounds, some other mechanisms might be involved. Other properties that could boost the interest in this herb are antimicrobial and antiviral activities. Being a common synanthropic weed or ruderal plant, C. majus spreads in all temperate Eurasia and acclimates well to North America. Little is known about the natural variation of bioactive metabolites, including several aforementioned isoquinoline alkaloids. In this review, we put together older and recent literature data on phytochemistry, pharmacology, and clinical studies on C. majus aiming at a critical evaluation of state-of-the-art from the viewpoint of historical and folk indications.

We show here that the treatment of living cells with Am reversibly perturbs the microtubule cytoskeleton, provoking a dose-dependent cell arrest in the M phase. Am changed the dynamics of tubulin polymerization in vitro, promoted the appearance of aberrant mitotic phenotypes in HeLa cells and induced apoptosis by the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP, without inducing DNA breaks. Am treatment of HeLa cells induced changes in the phosphorylation of the growth suppressor pRb that coincided with maximum mitotic index. The dose-dependent and reversible anti-proliferative effect of Am was observed in several transformed cell lines.

Herbal medicinal products are often used for the relief of dyspeptic symptoms. Aims: : To critically assess the evidence for and against herbal medicinal products for the treatment of non-ulcer dyspepsia. Methods: Systematic searches were performed in six electronic databases and the reference lists located were checked for further relevant publications. No language restrictions were imposed. Experts in the field and manufacturers of identified herbal extracts were also contacted. All randomized clinical trials of herbal medicinal products administered as supplements to human subjects were included. Results: Seventeen randomized clinical trials were identified, nine of which involved peppermint and caraway as constituents of combination preparations. Symptoms were reduced by all treatments (60-95% of patients reported improvements in symptoms). The mechanism of any anti-dyspeptic action is difficult to define, as the causes of non-ulcer dyspepsia are unclear. There appear to be few adverse effects associated with these remedies, although, in many cases, comprehensive safety data were not available. Conclusions: There are several herbal medicinal products with anti-dyspeptic activity and encouraging safety profiles.

201,misbelief,23238299,"Cancer cells often develop multidrug resistance (MDR) which is a multidimensional problem involving several mechanisms and targets. This study demonstrates that chelidonine and an alkaloid extract from Chelidonium majus, which contains protoberberine and benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids, has the ability to overcome MDR of different cancer cell lines through interaction with ABC-transporters, CYP3A4 and GST, by induction of apoptosis, and cytotoxic effects. Chelidonine and the alkaloid extract inhibited P-gp/MDR1 activity in a concentration-dependent manner in Caco-2 and CEM/ADR5000 and reversed their doxorubicin resistance. In addition, chelidonine and the alkaloid extract inhibited the activity of the drug modifying enzymes CYP3A4 and GST in a dose-dependent manner. The alkaloids induced apoptosis in MDR cells which was accompanied by an activation of caspase-3, -8,-6/9, and phosphatidyl serine (PS) exposure. cDNA arrays were applied to identify differentially expressed genes after treatment with chelidonine and the alkaloid extract. The expression analysis identified a common set of regulated genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle, and drug metabolism. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with 50 μg/ml alkaloid extract and 50 μM chelidonine for up to 48 h resulted in a significant decrease in mRNA levels of P-gp/MDR1, MRP1, BCRP, CYP3A4, GST, and hPXR and in a significant increase in caspase-3 and caspase-8 mRNA. Thus, chelidonine is a promising model compound for overcoming MDR and for enhancing cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutics, especially against leukaemia cells.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of celandine on the uterine muscle, using a perfusion model of swine uteri. Study design: Sixteen swine uteri were perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution. Celandine (Chelidonium, Paverysat; Johannes Bürger Ysatfabrik Ltd., Bad Harzburg, Germany) was administered at increasing dosages. Intrauterine pressure (IUP) was recorded using an intrauterine double-chip microcatheter (Urobar 8 DS-F, Raumedic, Rehau AG &amp; Co., Rehau, Germany). Differences in pressure (ΔP) and area under the curve (ΔAUC) after drug administration in the uterine body and uterine horn in the various dilution series were noted. A paired Student's t-test was used to evaluate differences between groups, with significance set at P 0.05. Results: A significant initial increase in uterine activity was visible at each dosage. Inhibition of uterine activity was seen over longer periods of 5 and 10 min, particularly for a medium-dose range of 1-2mg/ml. At a dosage of 2mg/ml in particular, celandine almost always led to significant values. Conclusion: Following intra-arterial administration in a swine uterus perfusion model, celandine initially causes a significant increase in contractility, which is followed over time by a relaxation phase.

Apoptosis induction by CHE and SAN in these cells was accompanied by caspase-9 and -3 activation and an increase in the pro-apoptotic Bax protein. An elevation in the percentage of MT-4 cells possessing caspase-3 in active form after their treatment with CHE or SAN was in parallel to a corresponding increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells. The involvement of mitochondria in apoptosis induction by both alkaloids was supported by cytochrome C elevation in cytosol, with an accompanying decrease in cytochrome C content in the mitochondrial fraction. At the same time, two alkaloids under study differed drastically in their cell cycle phase-specific effects, since only CHE arrested MT-4 cells in G(2)/M phase.

The specific capacity of each alkaloid to penetrate into the cells was estimated by monitoring alkaloid concentration decreases in the cell medium during incubation with murine fibroblast NIH/3T3, mouse melanoma B16F10, and human breast cancer MCF7 cell lines. Mixtures of isoquinoline alkaloids containing protopine, chelidonine, sanguinarine, allocryptopine, and stylopine were applied to cell cultures for 20 and 40 min, and the content of alkaloids in the cell media was measured by capillary electrophoresis (CE).

As these alkaloids have native fluorescence, they were directly detected using the commercially available UV light-emitting diode without troublesome fluorescent derivatization. The results showed a differential ability of celandine alkaloids to penetrate into the normal and cancer cell interior, which was inversely proportional to their cytotoxic activity. While the most effective transport of celandine alkaloids from the cell medium to the cell interior was observed for normal murine fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells (about 55% of total content), cytotoxicity tests demonstrated selective and profound apoptotic effects of a five-alkaloid combination in the mouse melanoma B16F10 cell line.",Does celandine help with cancer?,celandine help cancer,0.0,Does celandine help with cancer?,0.9986552000045776

Silymarin is a derivative from the milk thistle plant with few side effects that has been safely used for centuries to treat liver ailments. Since the 1970s, there has been a reemergence of the marketing and use of silymarin. Research results of some small studies suggest silymarin has hepatoprotective, antiinflammatory, and regenerative properties producing a beneficial effect for some types of hepatitis. It is unclear, however, whether silymarin might interfere with the effect of interferon or ribavirin. A well-designed, placebo-controlled study of a larger population is needed.

203,misbelief,19303273,"Purpose: Milk thistle or its purified extract, silymarin (Silybum marianum), is widely used in treating acute or chronic hepatitis. Although silymarin is hepatoprotective in animal experiments and some human hepatotoxic exposures, its efficacy in ameliorating the symptoms of acute clinical hepatitis remains inconclusive. In this study, our purpose was to determine whether silymarin improves symptoms, signs and laboratory test results in patients with acute clinical hepatitis, regardless of etiology. Methods: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which participants, treating physicians and data management staff were blinded to treatment group. The study was conducted at two fever hospitals in Tanta and Banha, Egypt where patients with symptoms compatible with acute clinical hepatitis and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of normal were enrolled. The intervention consisted of three times daily ingestion of either a standard recommended dose of 140 mg of silymarin (Legalon, MADAUS GmbH, Cologne, Germany), or a vitamin placebo for four weeks with an additional four-week follow-up. The primary outcomes were symptoms and signs of acute hepatitis and results of liver function tests on days 2, 4 and 7 and weeks 2, 4, and 8. Side-effects and adverse events were ascertained by self-report. Results: From July 2003 through October 2005, 105 eligible patients were enrolled after providing informed consent. No adverse events were noted and both silymarin and placebo were well tolerated. Patients randomized to the silymarin group had quicker resolution of symptoms related to biliary retention: dark urine (p=0.013), jaundice (p=0.02) and scleral icterus (p=0.043). There was a reduction in indirect bilirubin among those assigned to silymarin (p=0.012), but other variables including direct bilirubin, ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were not significantly reduced. Conclusions: Patients receiving silymarin had earlier improvement in subjective and clinical markers of biliary excretion. Despite a modest sample size and multiple etiologies for acute clinical hepatitis, our results suggest that standard recommended doses of silymarin are safe and may be potentially effective in improving symptoms of acute clinical hepatitis despite lack of a detectable effect on biomarkers of the underlying hepatocellular inflammatory process.",Can hepatitis be cured with milk thistle?,hepatitis cured milk thistle,0.0,Can hepatitis be cured with milk thistle?,0.9438377618789673
203,misbelief,16255756,"Silymarin from the milk thistle herb (Silybum marianum) is used by many patients with chronic viral hepatitis, but its efficacy remains unknown. We performed a systematic review of silymarin for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis B and C. An exhaustive search strategy identified 148 papers that studied silymarin compounds in liver disease. Of these, four trials included patients with hepatitis C, one included hepatitis B patients, and two, unspecified chronic viral hepatitis. However, only one trial exclusively studied patients with hepatitis C, and none involved patients with only hepatitis B. Silymarin treatment resulted in a decrease in serum transaminases compared with baseline in four studies, and compared with placebo in only one study. There is no evidence that silymarin affects viral load or improves liver histology in hepatitis B or C. No studies were found that investigated the use of silymarin concomitantly with interferon, nucleoside analogues, or other conventional treatments for hepatitis B or C. In conclusion, silymarin compounds likely decrease serum transaminases in patients with chronic viral hepatitis, but do not appear to affect viral load or liver histology.

204,misbelief,23926485,"Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine and metabolic disorder associated with ovulatory dysfunction. Presently, little is known about the primary factors that initiate PCOS. Chamomile flowers are used in alternative medicine for its anti-spasmolytic and anti-inflammatory effects. Antispasmodic properties of chamomile ease menstrual cramps and lessen the possibility of premature labor. This medicinal herb also stimulates menstruation. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Chamomile alcoholic-extract on the biochemical and clinical parameters in a rat model of PCOS. Materials and methods: Estrous cyclicity of 30 virgin adult cycling rats was monitored by vaginal smears obtained between 0800 and 1200 hours. After about 4 days, each rat received an i.m. injection of Estradiol Valerate (Aburaihan Co., Iran), 2 mg in 0.2 ml of corn oil, to induce PCO. Corn oil was injected to the rats in the control group. All the rats in the experimental group were evaluated for follicular cysts 60 days after the injection. Rats with PCOS were treated by multiple doses (25, 50, 75 mg/kg) of intraperitoneal injections of Chamomile alcoholic-extract for ten days. The data were statistically analyzed at a significance level of p 0.05 by ANOVA, followed by the Student Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Results: The histological and hormonal results showed that Chamomile can decrease the signs of PCOS in the ovarian tissue and help LH secretion in rats (p 0.05). Conclusion: The alcoholic-extract of dried Matricaria chamomilla L. flowers can not only induce recovery from a PCO induced state in rats, but also increase dominant follicles.

204,misbelief,34811612,"Globally, there is increasing demand for safe poultry food products free from antibiotic residues. There is thus a need to develop alternatives to antibiotics with safe nutritional feed derivatives that maximize performance, promote the intestinal immune status, enrich beneficial microbiota, promote health, and reduce the adverse effects of pathogenic infectious microorganisms. With the move away from including antibiotics in poultry diets, botanicals are among the most important alternatives to antibiotics. Some botanicals such as fennel, garlic, oregano, mint, and rosemary have been reported to increase the poultry's growth rate and/or feed to gain ratio. Botanicals' role is assumed to be mediated by improved immune responses and/or shifts in the microbial population in the intestine, with the elimination of pathogenic species. In addition, modulation of the gut microbiota resulted in various physiological and immunological responses and promoted beneficial bacterial strains that led to a healthy gut. There is thus a need to understand the relationship between poultry diets supplemented with botanicals and good health of the entire gastrointestinal tract if we intend to use these natural products to promote general health status and production. This current review provides an overview of current knowledge about certain botanicals that improve poultry productivity by modulating intestinal health and reducing the negative impacts of numerous pathogenic bacteria.

204,misbelief,22682202,"Background: The essential oil of chamomile, one of the oldest and agronomically most important medicinal plant species in Europe, has significant antiphlogistic, spasmolytic and antimicrobial activities. It is rich in chamazulene, a pharmaceutically active compound spontaneously formed during steam distillation from the sesquiterpene lactone matricine. Chamomile oil also contains sesquiterpene alcohols and hydrocarbons which are produced by the action of terpene synthases (TPS), the key enzymes in constructing terpene carbon skeletons. Results: Here, we present the identification and characterization of five TPS enzymes contributing to terpene biosynthesis in chamomile (Matricaria recutita). Four of these enzymes were exclusively expressed in above-ground organs and produced the common terpene hydrocarbons (-)-(E)-β-caryophyllene (MrTPS1), (+)-germacrene A (MrTPS3), (E)-β-ocimene (MrTPS4) and (-)-germacrene D (MrTPS5). A fifth TPS, the multiproduct enzyme MrTPS2, was mainly expressed in roots and formed several Asteraceae-specific tricyclic sesquiterpenes with (-)-α-isocomene being the major product. The TPS transcript accumulation patterns in different organs of chamomile were consistent with the abundance of the corresponding TPS products isolated from these organs suggesting that the spatial regulation of TPS gene expression qualitatively contribute to terpene composition. Conclusions: The terpene synthases characterized in this study are involved in the organ-specific formation of essential oils in chamomile. While the products of MrTPS1, MrTPS2, MrTPS4 and MrTPS5 accumulate in the oils without further chemical alterations, (+)-germacrene A produced by MrTPS3 accumulates only in trace amounts, indicating that it is converted into another compound like matricine. Thus, MrTPS3, but also the other TPS genes, are good markers for further breeding of chamomile cultivars rich in pharmaceutically active essential oils.",Does chamomile help with thrush?,chamomile help thrush,0.0,Does chamomile help with thrush?,0.8524161577224731
204,misbelief,33631819,"Purpose: This article aims to evaluate management options for antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia and associated treatment considerations such as efficacy, tolerability, drug interactions, contraindications, and dosing regimens. Summary: Hyperprolactinemia is a common adverse effect of antipsychotics. First-line management includes reducing the dose of the offending antipsychotic, discontinuing the antipsychotic, or switching to another antipsychotic associated with a lower risk of hyperprolactinemia. However, these options are not always practical and are associated with a risk of relapse of the psychiatric illness. Other management options include adjunctive aripiprazole, dopamine agonists (cabergoline and bromocriptine), metformin, and herbal supplements. A search of Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar using key terms such as hyperprolactinemia, prolactin, antipsychotic, treatment guidelines, aripiprazole, dopamine agonist, cabergoline, bromocriptine, metformin, herbals, supplements, and medications was conducted for literature retrieval. Upon evaluation of the available literature we found the following: (1) aripiprazole is safe and effective in lowering prolactin levels within normal limits; (2) adjunctive cabergoline and bromocriptine decrease elevated prolactin levels, while cabergoline may be more effective in reducing prolactin but can also be associated with a more serious adverse effect of cardiac valvular abnormalities; (3) metformin causes a mild reduction of prolactin levels; and (4) there are limited data to support use of herbal medications (chamomile, Peony-Glycyrrhiza decoction, and shakuyaku-kanzo-to) in antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. Conclusion: There are treatments available for antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia in patients who are unable to alter their current antipsychotic regimen. However, there remains a need for additional short- and long-term studies to determine the efficacy and safety of these treatment strategies, given that patients taking antipsychotics typically require chronic, life-long treatment for their illnesses.",Does chamomile help with thrush?,chamomile help thrush,0.0,Does chamomile help with thrush?,0.9621734023094177

The effects of Roman chamomile on depression still unclear. In this study, we used chronically stressed mice to investigate whether inhalation of Roman chamomile essential oil affects depression-like behavior. We previously reported that restraint and water immersion stress produce depression-like behavior and a blunted response to the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine. Each mouse was exposed to restraint and water immersion stress for 15 days, and resistance to the effect of clomipramine was induced in a behavioral despair paradigm. In the present study, we found that cotreatment with clomipramine and inhalation of Roman chamomile attenuated depression-like behavior in a forced swim test. Next, we examined the hippocampal mRNA levels of two cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6); a neurotrophic factor, brain derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF); and nerve growth factor (NGF). TNF alpha, IL-6 and BDNF mRNA levels did not change in the hippocampus of stressed mice. However, the NGF mRNA level was significantly decreased, and this decrease was not attenuated by treatment with clomipramine or inhalation of Roman chamomile alone. We also examined whether Roman chamomile combined with clomipramine treatment affects hippocampal neurogenesis and serum corticosterone levels. Stressed mice had fewer doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, but this was significantly attenuated by Roman chamomile and clomipramine treatment. In addition, the serum corticosterone level was also significantly decreased by treatment with Roman chamomile and clomipramine.

204,misbelief,35496310,"Mood disorders, also often referred to as affective disorders, are a group of psychiatric illnesses that severely impact mood and its related functions. The high medical expenditures have placed a significant financial burden on patients and their families. Aromatherapy is an alternative and complementary treatment that utilizes essential oils (EOs) or volatile oils (VOs) to achieve major therapeutic goals. In general, EOs are volatile chemicals that enter the body primarily through skin absorption and/or nasal inhalation. In addition, they can work through oral administration. Inhalation aromatherapy has shown unique advantages for treating mood disorders, especially depression, anxiety and mental disorders such as sleep disorder, which have been validated over the last decade through clinical and animal studies. Accumulating evidence has shown that EOs or VOs can bypass the blood-brain barrier to target brain tissue through the nasal-brain pathway. Subsequently, they act on the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and limbic system in the brain to improve symptoms of anxiety, depression and improve sleep quality. Here, we review the natural aromatic plants' volatiles or essential oils used commonly as adjuncts to manage mood disorders and illustrate the mechanisms of inhalation aromatherapy, and mainly summarized the application of transnasal inhalation aromatherapy in depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. We conclude that aromatherapy does not cause side-effects, which is vastly different from commonly used psychotropic drugs.

Allium genus vegetables are of the most interesting herbs in restricting cancers that includes garlic, onions, leeks, chives, and shallots. These plants have been exploited in folk medicine because of their beneficial health effects in improving numerous diseases. The phytochemical analysis of various Allium genus members showed that, to date, 16 species have proved potential anticancer properties due to the accumulation of various sulfur and organic compounds like S-allyl mercaptocysteine, quercetin, flavonoids, and ajoene. These compounds with various mechanisms such as hindering cell cycle, inhibiting signaling pathways, inducing apoptosis, and antioxidant activity interfere with diverse stages of formation, growth, differentiation, and metastasis of cancer cells. Similar to garlic and onion, other species have exhibited anticancer activities, so that active natural molecules extracted from them might serve as possible anticancer agents. Therefore, evaluating the main ingredients and studying their anticancer mechanisms are of great importance. In this review, we aim to summarize the available data on anticancer mechanisms of 16 species of Allium genus and their major compounds to assist further researches on the treatment and prevention of cancers.",Does garlic help with thrush?,garlic help thrush,0.0,Does garlic help with thrush?,0.9538223147392273

Aims: To provide information on the benefits and limitations of eight representative home remedies as palliative care for orofacial pain during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: PubMed and Medline were electronically searched for eight home remedies for orofacial pain that can be used in COVID-19. Papers published in English in the past 30 years were considered. Among the published studies suitable for the research purpose, those in which the abstract and body text were confirmed were targeted, and duplicate studies were excluded. Finally, 86 studies were included. Results: There is extensive and high-level scientific evidence for the application of tooth brushing and flossing, mouth rinsing with chlorhexidine, use of over-the-counter pain medication, and application of cryotherapy in emergencies. Gargling with salt water, brushing with bamboo salt, gargling with garlic juice, and oil pulling are traditional methods used for centuries. The use of natural products for orofacial pain has a significant empirical effect but has weak scientific evidence. Conclusions: Knowing the correct application method, effects, and side effects is desirable to use these methods appropriately in emergencies. However, scientific evidence is unclear and generally lacking for home remedies to be the main treatment strategy, and there are clear limitations to their use as a single main treatment.",Does garlic help with thrush?,garlic help thrush,0.0,Does garlic help with thrush?,0.8837437629699707
205,misbelief,33777020,"One of the main targets for the use of phytogenics in aquafeeds is the mucosal tissues as they constitute a physical and biochemical shield against environmental and pathogenic threats, comprising elements from both the innate and acquired immunity. In the present study, the modulation of the skin transcriptional immune response, the bacterial growth capacity in skin mucus, and the overall health condition of gilthead seabream ( Sparus aurata ) juveniles fed a dietary supplementation of garlic essential oil, carvacrol, and thymol were assessed. The enrichment analysis of the skin transcriptional profile of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet revealed the regulation of genes associated to cellular components involved in the secretory pathway, suggesting the stimulation, and recruitment of phagocytic cells. Genes recognized by their involvement in non-specific immune response were also identified in the analysis. The promotion of the secretion of non-specific immune molecules into the skin mucus was proposed to be involved in the in vitro decreased growth capacity of pathogenic bacteria in the mucus of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. Although the mucus antioxidant capacity was not affected by the phytogenics supplementation, the regulation of genes coding for oxidative stress enzymes suggested the reduction of the skin oxidative stress. Additionally, the decreased levels of cortisol in mucus indicated a reduction in the fish allostatic load due to the properties of the tested additive. Altogether, the dietary garlic, carvacrol, and thymol appear to promote the gilthead seabream skin innate immunity and the mucus protective capacity, decreasing its susceptibility to be colonized by pathogenic bacteria.",Does garlic help with thrush?,garlic help thrush,0.0,Does garlic help with thrush?,0.897361695766449
205,misbelief,17256959,"The raw form of garlic and some of its preparations are widely recognized as antiplatelet agents that may contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Herein, we examined the in-vitro antiaggregatory activity (IVAA) of human blood platelets induced by extracts of garlic samples that were previously heated (in the form of crushed versus uncrushed cloves) using different cooking methods and intensities. The concentrations of allicin and pyruvate, two predictors of antiplatelet strength, were also monitored. Oven-heating at 200 degrees C or immersing in boiling water for 3 min or less did not affect the ability of garlic to inhibit platelet aggregation (as compared to raw garlic), whereas heating for 6 min completely suppressed IVAA in uncrushed, but not in previously crushed, samples. The latter samples had reduced, yet significant, antiplatelet activity. Prolonged incubation (more than 10 min) at these temperatures completely suppressed IVAA. Microwaved garlic had no effect on platelet aggregation. However, increasing the concentration of garlic juice in the aggregation reaction had a positive IVAA dose response in crushed, but not in uncrushed, microwaved samples. The addition of raw garlic juice to microwaved uncrushed garlic restored a full complement of antiplatelet activity that was completely lost without the garlic addition. Garlic-induced IVAA was always associated with allicin and pyruvate levels. Our results suggest that (1) allicin and thiosulfinates are responsible for the IVAA response, (2) crushing garlic before moderate cooking can reduce the loss of activity, and (3) the partial loss of antithrombotic effect in crushed-cooked garlic may be compensated by increasing the amount consumed.",Does garlic help with thrush?,garlic help thrush,0.0,Does garlic help with thrush?,0.8910965919494629
205,misbelief,33082387,"A microencapsulated feed additive composed by garlic, carvacrol and thymol essential oils (EOs) was evaluated regarding its protective effect in gills parasitized by Sparicotyle chrysophrii in Sparus aurata. A nutritional trial (65 days) followed by a cohabitation challenge with parasitized fish (39 days) were performed. Transcriptomic analysis by microarrays of gills of fish fed the EOs diet showed an up-regulation of genes related to biogenesis, vesicular transport and exocytosis, leukocyte-mediated immunity, oxidation-reduction and overall metabolism processes. The functional network obtained indicates a tissue-specific pro-inflammatory immune response arbitrated by degranulating acidophilic granulocytes, sustained by antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses. The histochemical study of gills also showed an increase of carboxylate glycoproteins containing sialic acid in mucous and epithelial cells of fish fed the EOs diet, suggesting a mucosal defence mechanism through the modulation of mucin secretions. The outcomes of the in vivo challenge supported the transcriptomic results obtained from the nutritional trial, where a significant reduction of 78% in the abundance of S. chrysophrii total parasitation and a decrease in the prevalence of most parasitic developmental stages evaluated were observed in fish fed the EOs diet. These results suggest that the microencapsulation of garlic, carvacrol and thymol EOs could be considered an effective natural dietary strategy with antiparasitic properties against the ectoparasite S. chrysophrii.",Does garlic help with thrush?,garlic help thrush,0.0,Does garlic help with thrush?,0.9985694885253906

With the outbreak of COVID-19, garlic-related misinformation is spreading through social media, including Twitter. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) can be used to classify misinformation from a vast number of tweets. This study aimed to apply the BERT model for classifying misinformation on garlic and COVID-19 on Twitter, using 5929 original tweets mentioning garlic and COVID-19 (4151 for fine-tuning, 1778 for test). Tweets were manually labeled as 'misinformation' and 'other.' We fine-tuned five BERT models (BERT BASE , BERT LARGE , BERTweet-base, BERTweet-COVID-19, and BERTweet-large) using a general COVID-19 rumor dataset or a garlic-specific dataset. Accuracy and F1 score were calculated to evaluate the performance of the models. The BERT models fine-tuned with the COVID-19 rumor dataset showed poor performance, with maximum accuracy of 0.647. BERT models fine-tuned with the garlic-specific dataset showed better performance. BERTweet models achieved accuracy of 0.897-0.911, while BERT BASE and BERT LARGE achieved accuracy of 0.887-0.897. BERTweet-large showed the best performance with maximum accuracy of 0.911 and an F1 score of 0.894. Thus, BERT models showed good performance in classifying misinformation.

206,misbelief,35107434,"Background: Health-related social media data are increasingly being used in disease surveillance studies. In particular, surveillance of infectious diseases such as influenza has demonstrated high correlations between the number of social media posts mentioning the disease and the number of patients who went to the hospital and were diagnosed with the disease. However, the prevalence of some diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, cannot be estimated based on the number of patients alone. Specifically, individuals with allergic rhinitis typically self-medicate by taking over-the-counter (OTC) medications without going to the hospital. Although allergic rhinitis is not a life-threatening disease, it represents a major social problem because it reduces people's quality of life, making it essential to understand its prevalence and people's motives for self-medication behavior. Objective: This study aims to explore the relationship between the number of social media posts mentioning the main symptoms of allergic rhinitis and the sales volume of OTC rhinitis medications in Japan. Methods: We collected tweets over 4 years (from 2017 to 2020) that included keywords corresponding to the main nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis: ""sneezing,"" ""runny nose,"" and ""stuffy nose."" We also obtained the sales volume of OTC drugs, including oral medications and nasal sprays, for the same period. We then calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between time series data on the number of tweets per week and time series data on the sales volume of OTC drugs per week. Results: The results showed a much higher correlation (r=0.8432) between the time series data on the number of tweets mentioning ""stuffy nose"" and the time series data on the sales volume of nasal sprays than for the other two symptoms. There was also a high correlation (r=0.9317) between the seasonal components of these time series data. Conclusions: We investigated the relationships between social media data and behavioral patterns, such as OTC drug sales volume. Exploring these relationships can help us understand the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and the motives for self-care treatment using social media data, which would be useful as a marketing indicator to reduce the number of out-of-stocks in stores, provide (sell) rhinitis medicines to consumers in a stable manner, and reduce the loss of sales opportunities. In the future, in-depth investigations are required to estimate sales volume using social media data, and future research could investigate other diseases and countries.",Does aloe help for a runny nose?,aloe help runny nose,0.0,Does aloe help for a runny nose?,0.885875940322876
206,misbelief,27799071,"Background: Primary immunodeficiencies include a variety of disorders that render patients more susceptible to infections. If left untreated, these infections may be fatal. Patients with primary antibody deficiencies are therefore given prophylactic immunoglobulin G replacement therapy. ColdZyme® Mouth Spray is a medical device intended to reduce the probability of catching a cold and/or can help shorten the duration of a cold, if used at an early stage of the infection, by forming a thin protective barrier on the pharyngeal mucous membrane. This is the first report of this kind in the literature. Case presentation: The parents of a 12-year-old white boy diagnosed as having common variable immunodeficiency voluntarily started to let their son use ColdZyme® Mouth Spray to reduce common cold infections if possible. Prior to using ColdZyme® Mouth Spray, he had recurrent microbial infections of his ears, sinuses, nose, bronchi, and lungs. He also frequently exhibited continuous rhinorrhea, fungal growth in his oral cavity, and gingivitis with wounds in his gums. As a consequence, his and his family's health-related quality of life was severely compromised. He commenced a twice-daily treatment (morning and evening) with ColdZyme® Mouth Spray; the weekly administration of immunoglobulin G (Hizentra®) for replacement therapy was continued throughout this period. Data were retrieved by using a daily diary about infections and symptoms. His guardians had recorded infection symptoms since he was diagnosed as having common variable immunodeficiency 10 years earlier to follow the effect of the immunoglobulin G treatment. Shortly after commencement of ColdZyme® Mouth Spray treatment, he experienced a marked improvement in symptoms and health-related quality of life. His continuous rhinorrhea disappeared, breathing through his nose was easier, oral fungal infection decreased, and wounds in his gum tissue healed for the first time in several years. Conclusions: We observed that when ColdZyme® Mouth Spray was used to reduce common cold viral infection in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency on immunoglobulin G replacement therapy, secondary microbial and fungal infections in his oral cavity and oropharynx were also reduced.

206,misbelief,26425089,"Developing multifaceted, biocompatible, artificial implants for tissue engineering is a growing field of research. In recent times, several works have been reported about the utilization of biomolecules in combination with synthetic materials to achieve this process. Accordingly, in this study, the ability of an extract obtained from Aloe vera, a commonly used medicinal plant in influencing the biocompatibility of artificial material, is scrutinized using metallocene polyethylene (mPE). The process of coating dense fibrous Aloe vera extract on the surface of mPE was carried out using microwaves. Then, several physicochemical and blood compatibility characterization experiments were performed to disclose the effects of corresponding surface modification. The Fourier transform infrared spectrum showed characteristic vibrations of several active constituents available in Aloe vera and exhibited peak shifts at far infrared regions due to aloe-based mineral deposition. Meanwhile, the contact angle analysis demonstrated a drastic increase in wettability of coated samples, which confirmed the presence of active components on glazed mPE surface. Moreover, the bio-mimic structure of Aloe vera fibers and the influence of microwaves in enhancing the coating characteristics were also meticulously displayed through scanning electron microscopy micrographs and Hirox 3D images. The existence of nanoscale roughness was interpreted through high-resolution profiles obtained from atomic force microscopy. And the extent of variations in irregularities was delineated by measuring average roughness. Aloe vera-induced enrichment in the hemocompatible properties of mPE was established by carrying out in vitro tests such as activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, platelet adhesion, and hemolysis assay. In conclusion, the Aloe vera-glazed mPE substrate was inferred to attain desirable properties required for multifaceted biomedical implants.",Does aloe help for a runny nose?,aloe help runny nose,0.0,Does aloe help for a runny nose?,0.9643805027008057
206,misbelief,19405150,"Physiological responses to acute stress proceed with the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) system. Many brain regions are known to modulate the HPA axis activation in stress responses, but the detailed neural circuits and signaling system in the upstream of the HPA axis have to be explored further. Type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5) is highly concentrated in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens, which are implicated in reward and stress-related behavior. AC5(-/-) mice exposed to daily 2-hr restraint stress for only 3-5 days showed poor stress-coping responses, including severe body weight loss, poor coat condition, respiratory difficulties, and freezing behavior. Plasma corticosterone levels during 2-hr stress sessions increased in AC5(-/-) mice compared with those of AC5(+/+) mice. However, neither the corticosterone receptor antagonist RU486 nor the CRH receptor antagonist NBI27914 blocked their poor stress coping, whereas the administration of the GABA(A) receptor allosteric modulator diazepam or the D1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH23390 prior to restraint stress sessions changed their stress-coping response to the stressed AC5(+/+) mouse level. Stress-triggered c-Fos expression was completely blunted in the dorsal striatum of AC5(-/-). These results suggest that the AC5-associated signal system and neural network are involved in the regulation of anxiety and stress-coping response.",Does aloe help for a runny nose?,aloe help runny nose,0.0,Does aloe help for a runny nose?,0.9779726266860962

206,misbelief,32620567,"Objective: We aimed to explore the views of Malaysian children with asthma and their parents to enhance understanding of early influences on development of self-management skills. Design: This is a qualitative study conducted among children with asthma and their parents. We used purposive sampling and conducted focus groups and interviews using a semi-structured topic guide in the participants' preferred language. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, entered into NVivo and analysed using a grounded theory approach. Settings: We identified children aged 7-12 years with parent-reported, physician-diagnosed asthma from seven suburban primary schools in Malaysia. Focus groups and interviews were conducted either at schools or a health centre. Results: Ninety-nine participants (46 caregivers, 53 children) contributed to 24 focus groups and 6 individual interviews. Children mirrored their parents' management of asthma but, in parallel, learnt and gained confidence to independently self-manage asthma from their own experiences and self-experimentation. Increasing independence was more apparent in children aged 10 years and above. Cultural norms and beliefs influenced children's independence to self-manage asthma either directly or indirectly through their social network. External influences, for example, support from school and healthcare, also played a role in the transition. Conclusion: Children learnt the skills to self-manage asthma as early as 7 years old with growing independence from the age of 10 years. Healthcare professionals should use child-centred approach and involve schools to facilitate asthma self-management and support a smooth transition to independent self-management.

206,misbelief,27329923,"Introduction: The role of platelet activation in allergic inflammation is receiving increasing attention. Sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis can modify the immunological process to an allergen, rather than simply treating symptoms. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the role of platelet activation during sublingual immunotherapy in children with allergic rhinitis. Methods: Forty-two House Dust Mite - sensitized children with allergic rhinitis were enrolled and received House Dust Mite allergen extract for sublingual immunotherapy or placebo. Serum of different time points during treatment was collected and used for detection of Platelet Factor-4 and Beta-Thromboglobulin concentration by Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay. Results: Our data showed decreased expression of Platelet Factor-4 and Beta-Thromboglobulin protein after one year's sublingual immunotherapy. In addition, the decrease of symptom scores and serum Platelet Factor-4 and Beta-Thromboglobulin protein concentrations was positively related. Conclusion: During sublingual immunotherapy, platelet activation was inhibited significantly.

206,misbelief,35833241,"Objectives: Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is a diagnostic challenge due to its overlapping symptomatology with other sinonasal diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate whether items on the sinonasal outcome test (SNOT)-22 could suggest a diagnosis of spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea versus chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). Methods: A multi-institutional retrospective chart review of patients with spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea and a control group of CRSsNP patients was performed. Individual SNOT-22 scores and domain scores were compared. Results: One hundred fifteen patients were included in both cohorts. Of the patients in the CSF rhinorrhea group, 48% were misdiagnosed as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) prior to the correct identification of a CSF leak. On bivariate analysis, the CSF rhinorrhea group scored significantly higher on the SNOT-22 for runny nose ( P .001) and was more likely to designate this symptom as most important ( P .001). The CRSsNP group scored significantly higher in nasal blockage ( P .001), thick nasal discharge ( P .001), facial pain/pressure ( P .001), and in the ear/facial ( P .001) and rhinologic ( P = .003) domains. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that runny nose ( P .001) was most predictive of spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea while nasal blockage ( P .001), thick nasal discharge ( P .001), and facial pain/pressure ( P = .001) were predictive of CRSsNP after adjusting for relevant confounders. No significant difference was observed in total SNOT-22 scores between groups ( P = .676). Conclusions: Spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea is commonly misdiagnosed as other sinonasal pathologies. However, individual SNOT-22 items can help aid in suggesting a CSF leak. Spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea should be suspected in patients who have high SNOT-22 scores for runny nose and report this symptom as most important, but have lower scores related to the other cardinal symptoms of CRS.",Does aloe help for a runny nose?,aloe help runny nose,0.0,Does aloe help for a runny nose?,0.9723132252693176

Although such chemical burns typically are associated with misuse of analgesics, investigators also have reported them in conjunction with topical application of a variety of other agents. Case description: The authors report an unusual case of a 49-year-old man seeking care for maxillary tooth pain who had an oral mucosal burn of the maxillary vestibule caused by topical application of crushed raw garlic. The patient believed this treatment would alleviate his dental pain. Localized tissue necrosis was visible at the site of application. The authors instructed the patient to cease self-treatment with raw garlic but deemed treatment was otherwise unnecessary. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the second reported case of a garlic burn of the oral mucosa. The authors discuss the history of garlic as a naturopathic remedy, as well as the development of chemical burns associated with its topical use. The authors also review the literature on chemical burns caused by inappropriate self-treatment. Conclusions and practical implications: Dentists should consider the possibility of an oral chemical burn when a patient has a destructive or necrotic mucosal lesion located near a painful tooth. In this report, the authors highlight the importance of obtaining a detailed clinical history to establish a proper diagnosis and proper patient education to prevent future mucosal injury from inappropriate self-treatment.

Garlic contains a complex mixture of oil and water-soluble organosulfur compounds. Diallyl disulfide (DADS), an oil-soluble constituent of garlic seems to be effective in reducing tumour cells originating from colon, lung and skin. Hence our present study focuses on the dose-dependent effect of DADS on an androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line. Various concentrations of DADS ranging from 25 to 100 microM were given to LNCaP cells and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP) and the level of prostate specific antigen were studied. DADS reduced the secretory activity of LNCaP cells with the gradual increase in dosage. DADS was found to act as a good antiproliferative agent, which was confirmed by proliferation assay. DADS also induced apoptosis and nuclear segmentation in the higher doses.",Does garlic help with toothache?,garlic help toothache,0.0,Does garlic help with toothache?,0.998158872127533
207,misbelief,23277707,"This review article on the beneficial uses of Allium antioxidants tries to give some answers to the recent doubts raised by Singh et al. (Ind J Clin Biochem 25(3):225-243, 2010) against the claim of some researchers that Antioxidants (AOs) are miraculous molecules. Many people still believe that vitamins like A, C and E are the only true AOs that play important role in the corrections of metabolic derangements in life style diseases and hence all their faults are attributed to the failures of AOs as a class. This is quite unfair as there are many other natural AOs that do equal or even better AO action than the vitamins. Such is the case with the Allium S-alkyl sulfoxide aminoacids and their breakdown products viz, the various poly sulfides and their oxides e.g. allicin and ajoene type compounds which trap electrons mainly. It is true that antioxidant vitamins and β-carotene a precursor of Vitamin A bring about problems as prooxidant or as agents that block some metabolic pathways and gene expression. Again the argument that AOs cannot improve the level of antioxidant enzymes like SOD, catalase and glutathione Px is also not universal. Actually allium AOs can even spare the use of antioxidant vitamins in the body and enhance the action of antioxidant enzymes and supply of ATP and other nutrients to the tissues as the former are good vasodialators and promoters of membrane permeability. The use of AOs should be selective and moderate. Allium AOs satisfy the role of ideal AOs based on many of their invivo and invitro actions reported by the author and others. Their metabolits can regenerate them and recycle them for a sufficient time in the body. They have non antioxidant effects also such as antiplatelet, fibrinolytic, antiinflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiageing actions etc. Plant derived AOs may be more beneficial and better tolerated in their partially purified forms rather than in their absolutely purified forms as the accompanying principles have some protective and regulatory effects in general. This and other aspects of allium AOs are discussed in the paper.",Does garlic help with toothache?,garlic help toothache,0.0,Does garlic help with toothache?,0.8031984567642212
207,misbelief,28974229,"Background: To use any domestic remedy, specific knowledge and skills are required. Simple logic dictates that the use of wild plants in the context of limited interaction with nature requires prior identification, while in the case of non-plant remedies and cultivated plants this step can be omitted. This paper aims to document the current and past uses of non-plant remedies and cultivated plants in the study region for human/animal medication; to analyze the human medicinal and veterinary use areas in the context of the remedy groups; to qualitatively compare the results with relevant historical publications; and to compare the intensity and purpose of use between the remedy groups. Methods: During field studies 134 semi-structured interviews were conducted with locals from 11 villages in the Liubań district of Belarus. Currently used home-remedies as well as those used in the past were documented by employing the folk history method. The subject was approached through health-related uses, not by way of remedies. Interview records were digitalized and structured in Detailed Use Records in order to ascertain local perceptions. An Informant Consensus Factor (FIC) was calculated for remedy groups as well as for different use categories. Results: In the human medication area the use of nearby remedies was neither very diverse nor numerous: 266 DUR for 45 taxa belonging to 27 families were recorded for cultivated plants along with 188 DUR for 58 different non-plant remedies. The FIC values for both remedy groups were lower than for wild plants. In the ethnoveterinary medicine use area there were 48 DUR referring to the use of 14 cultivated plant taxa from 12 families and 72 DUR referring to the use of 31 non-plant remedies. The FIC value for the whole veterinary use area of cultivated plants was relatively low, yet similar to the FIC of wild plants. Conclusions: Differences between remedy groups were pronounced, indicating that in domestic human medicine cultivated plants and non-plant remedies are either remarkably less important than wild ones or not considered worth talking about. In ethnoveterinary medicine non-plant remedies are almost equally important as wild plants, while cultivated plants are the least used. People in study area seem to still more often rely on, or are more willing to talk to strangers about, wild plants, as promoted by both official medicine and popular literature.",Does garlic help with toothache?,garlic help toothache,0.0,Does garlic help with toothache?,0.518717885017395

Methods: A literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases was performed using keywords such as ""garlic"" and ""hypercholesterolemia,"" and the deadline ""July 14 (th), 2017."" After extracting relevant details, each selected literature was evaluated for quality according to the quality evaluation criteria of bias risk recommended by Cochrane Collaboration recommendations and heterogeneity tests were performed. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were evaluated using R 3.12 software. The publication bias was assessed using Egger method. Results: A total of 14 eligible papers published from 1981 to 2016 were included. The quality of the literatures was of moderate to high qualities. The values of TC (SMD = -1.26, 95% CI, -1.86 to -0.66), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (SMD = -1.07, 95% CI, -1.67 to -0.47), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (SMD = 0.50, 95% CI, 0.06-0.94) after taking garlic in the experimental group and the control group have statistical significance, while there was no significant difference of TG in the 2 groups (SMD = -0.16, 95% CI, -0.87-0.55). However, the result of HDL was reversed when removed some of the literatures. No significant publication bias among the eligible studies with values of TC (P = .0625), LDL (P = .0770), HDL (P = .2293), and TG (P = .3436). Conclusion: Garlic can reduce the level of TC and LDL instead of HDL and TG, indicating the ability of anti-hyperlipidemia.",Does garlic help with toothache?,garlic help toothache,0.0,Does garlic help with toothache?,0.8453269004821777

Small for gestational age (SGA) is an important perinatal outcome and has been associated with long term complications. We examined the association between maternal caffeine intake and SGA using National Birth Defects Prevention Study data. Non-malformed live born infants with an estimated date of delivery from 1997-2007 (n = 7,943) were included in this analysis. Maternal caffeine exposure was examined as total caffeine intake and individual caffeinated beverage type (coffee, tea, and soda); sex-, race/ethnic-, and parity-specific growth curves were constructed to estimate SGA births. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. Interaction with caffeine exposures was assessed for maternal smoking, vasoconstrictor medication use, and folic acid. Six hundred forty-eight infants (8.2%) were found to be SGA in this analysis. Increasing aORs were observed for increasing intakes of total caffeine and for each caffeinated beverage with aORs (adjusting for maternal education, high blood pressure, and smoking) ranging from 1.3 to 2.1 for the highest intake categories (300+ mg/day total caffeine and 3+ servings/day for each beverage type). Little indication of additive interaction by maternal smoking, vasoconstrictor medication use, or folic acid intake was observed. We observed an increase in SGA births for mothers with higher caffeine intake, particularly for those consuming 300+ mg of caffeine per day.

208,misbelief,22407137,"Background: Many epidemiologic studies have evaluated the association between caffeine and fertility, with inconsistent results. Some studies suggest that various caffeine-containing beverages may affect fertility differently. Methods: We evaluated the relation of caffeine, coffee, tea, and sodas with time to pregnancy in a prospective cohort study of 3628 women planning a pregnancy, in Denmark (2007-2010). Women reported beverage intake at baseline and every 8 weeks during follow-up until they became pregnant or for up to 12 cycles. We used discrete-time Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate fecundability ratios (FRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling for potential confounders. Results: There was little relation between fecundability and caffeine intake of 300+ mg/day compared with 100 mg/day (FR = 1.04 [95% CI = 0.90-1.21]) or coffee intake of 3+ servings/day compared with none (1.05 [0.85-1.33]). Soda consumption was associated with reduced fecundability: for all types of sodas combined, the adjusted FRs were 0.89 (0.80-0.98), 0.85 (0.71-1.02), 0.84 (0.57-1.25), and 0.48 (0.21-1.13) for 1, 1, 2, and 3+ servings per day, respectively, compared with none. Tea drinking was associated with a slight increase in fecundability, with FR = 1.27 (0.98-1.64) for 2+ servings/day versus none. Conclusion: In this prospective study of time to pregnancy, the association between caffeine intake and fertility differed by beverage type. Although we controlled for many confounders, our findings of reduced fecundability among soda drinkers and increased fecundability among tea drinkers could have resulted from confounding by unmeasured lifestyle characteristics.",Can pregnant women drink coffee?,pregnant drink coffee,0.0,Can pregnant women drink coffee?,0.5738304257392883

Methods: This clinical study was performed with two groups. For the study group, 63 participants with isolated borderline oligohydramnios who agreed to drink one cup of instant coffee were included in this study while 63 participants with isolated borderline oligohydramnios who did not drink one cup of instant coffee formed the control group. AFI, RI and PI were evaluated both before and after coffee intake. Results: Maternal characteristics of all study population were homogenous. FRABF indices were similar in both before and after coffee consumption. AFI was increased significantly six hours after drinking coffee (p 0.001).

Methods: From a Danish pregnancy cohort established in 1984-1987, 347 sons out of 5109 were selected for a follow-up study conducted 2005-2006. Semen and blood samples were analyzed for conventional semen characteristics and reproductive hormones and were related to information on maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy and present caffeine consumption.

Although some interventional trials suggest that green tea has beneficial effects on CVD risk factors, such as hypertension and obesity, others have failed to show such benefits. Aims: To evaluate the short-term effects of green tea on blood pressure, endothelial function, metabolic profile, and inflammatory activity in obese prehypertensive women. Methods: This study was a crossover, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants were randomly allocated to receive daily 3 capsules containing either 500 mg of green tea extract (GTE) or a matching placebo for 4 weeks, with a washout period of 2 weeks between treatments. Each GTE capsule contained 260 mg of polyphenols. At the beginning and at the end of each treatment, participants were submitted to evaluation of blood pressure (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, ABPM), endothelial function (Endo-PAT 2000 and cellular adhesion molecules), nutritional parameters, metabolic profile, and biomarkers of inflammation. Results: Twenty women age 41.1 ± 8.4 years completed the study. After 4 weeks of GTE supplementation in comparison with placebo, there was a significant decrease (p 0.05) in systolic blood pressure at 24 hours (-3.61 ± 1.23 vs 1.05 ± 1.34 mmHg), daytime (-3.61 ± 1.26 vs 0.80 ± 1.57 mmHg), and nighttime (-3.94 ± 1.70 vs 1.90 ± 1.66 mmHg).

The present study systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials and examined the effect of green tea consumption on blood pressure using meta-analysis. Methods: Search of ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library (CENTERAL) was conducted, to identify eligible articles. Articles from 1995 to 2013 were included. A random-effect model was chosen to calculate the effect of combined trials. Result: Thirteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Green tea consumption significantly changed systolic blood pressure, by -2.08 mm Hg (95% CI -3.06, -1.05), and diastolic blood pressure, by -1.71 mm Hg (95% CI -2.86, -0.56), compared to the control. Changes in lipid profile, blood glucose and body mass index were also assessed in the meta-analysis. A significant reduction was found in total cholesterol (-0.15 mmol/L [95% CI -0.27, -0.02]) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.16 mmol/L [95% CI -0.22, -0.09]). Changes in other parameters did not reach statistical significance. Subgroup analysis suggested a greater reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in studies that included participants with a baseline mean systolic blood pressure of ≥ 130 mm Hg, and studies involving consuming green tea as an extract. Conclusion: The present meta-analysis suggests that green tea and its catechins may improve blood pressure, and the effect may be greater in those with systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg.

In this meta-analysis of RCTs, we aimed to assess the effects of green tea supplementation on measures of BP control. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were electronically searched from inception to August 2019 for all relevant studies. The results were pooled using the generic inverse-variance method with random-effects weighting and expressed as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The quality of studies was assessed using the Jadad score. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots, Egger test, and Begg test. Results: Twenty-four trials with 1697 subjects were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that green tea significantly lowered systolic BP (SBP; MD: -1.17 mm Hg; 95%CI: -2.18 to -0.16mm Hg; P = .02) and diastolic BP (DBP; MD: -1.24 mm Hg; 95%CI:-2.07 to -0.40mm Hg; P = .004). Significant heterogeneity was found for both SBP (I = 43%) and DBP (I = 57%). In addition, no evidence of significant publication bias was found from funnel plots or Egger test (P = .674 and P = .270 for SBP and DBP, respectively).

Green tea is widely known to be potent antioxidant. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the effects of green tea in a model of hypertension. Methods: Hypertension was induced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor [N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME); 20 mg/kg per day, orally, for 2 weeks] in male Wistar rats. After the first week of L-NAME treatment, animals received green tea ad libitum for 1 week.

Results: L-NAME-treated animals exhibited an increase in blood pressure (165 ± 2 mmHg) compared with control rats (103 ± 1 mmHg) and green tea treatment reduced hypertension (119 ± 1 mmHg). Hypertensive animals showed a higher renal sympathetic nerve activity (161 ± 12 spikes/s) than the control group (97 ± 2 spikes/s), and green tea also decreased this parameter in the hypertensive treated group (125 ± 5 spikes/s).

Tea is the major contributor to total flavonoid intake in many populations. Flavonoids in tea have been shown to have a range of activities and effects that could contribute to improved health. Tea intake and the intake of flavonoids found in tea have been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease in several cross-sectional and prospective population studies. A variety of possible mechanisms have been investigated. The focus of the present review is on the mounting evidence that tea flavonoids can improve endothelial function and lower blood pressure. 3. In vitro studies using isolated vessels have shown that tea flavonoids possess vasodilator activity. Results of human intervention trials have shown that increased flavonoid intake from tea, as well as other dietary sources, can improve endothelial function. Emerging data also suggest that the degree of benefit may be related to flavonoid metabolism. 4. The effects of tea flavonoids on blood pressure are less consistent. Results of animal studies and population studies are consistent with a blood pressure-lowering effect of tea. However, short-term intervention trials, mainly in normotensive individuals, have not demonstrated any blood pressure reduction with tea. 5. Overall, the available data suggest that the effects of tea flavonoids on endothelial function and, perhaps, blood pressure may be responsible, at least in part, for any benefits of drinking tea on the risk of cardiovascular disease.",Can green tea reduce blood pressure?,green tea reduce blood pressure,1.0,Can green tea reduce blood pressure?,0.9192731976509094

Drinking green tea before lunch elicited significant pressor effects by increasing systolic and diastolic blood pressure an average of 15.1 mmHg and 5.7 mmHg, respectively. It had no significant effect on heart rate. Drinking green tea before meals is recommended for older adults who experience postprandial hypotension; however, the appropriate volume and time of green tea ingestion to prevent a postprandial drop in blood pressure should be further studied.",Can green tea reduce blood pressure?,green tea reduce blood pressure,1.0,Can green tea reduce blood pressure?,0.8728808760643005

210,misbelief,29058093,"Background: Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) is a popular flavoring that widely used in Asian, and the volatile oil in ginger rhizomes adds a special fragrance and taste to foods. The bioactive compounds in ginger, such as gingerols, diarylheptanoids, and flavonoids, are of significant value to human health because of their anticancer, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. However, as a non-model plant, knowledge about the genome sequences of ginger is extremely limited, and this limits molecular studies on this plant. In this study, de novo transcriptome sequencing was performed to investigate the expression of genes associated with the biosynthesis of major bioactive compounds in matured ginger rhizome (MG), young ginger rhizome (YG), and fibrous roots of ginger (FR). Results: A total of 361,876 unigenes were generated by de novo assembly. The expression of genes involved in the pathways responsible for the biosynthesis of major bioactive compounds differed between tissues (MG, YG, and FR). Two pathways that give rise to volatile oil, gingerols, and diarylheptanoids, the ""terpenoid backbone biosynthesis"" and ""stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis"" pathways, were significantly enriched (adjusted P value 0.05) for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR 0.005) both between the FR and YG libraries, and the FR and MG libraries. Most of the unigenes mapped in these two pathways, including curcumin synthase, phenylpropanoylacetyl-CoA synthase, trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase, and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase, were expressed to a significantly higher level (log 2 (fold-change) ≥ 1) in FR than in YG or MG.

The present study described brochodilatory activity of ginger oil and identified its active compound. Ginger oil was extracted by hydro-distillation. The compositions of ginger oil were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometer. Citral, eucalyptol and camphene were found to be the major components. Ginger oil and citral, but not camphene, suppressed rat tracheal contraction induced by carbachol (CCh). Consistent with previous report, eucalyptol showed a relaxing effect on rat airway. Since the content of eucalyptol in ginger oil was relatively low, the contribution of eucalyptol to the bronchodilatory effect of ginger oil was small. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the myorelaxing effect, propranolol (a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist), indomethacin (a COX inhibitor) and L-NAME (a NOS inhibitor) were used to block the inhibitory effects of ginger oil and citral. It was found that propranolol, but not indomethacin and L-NAME, reversed bronchodilatory effects of both ginger oil and citral, suggesting that a possible mechanism involved β-adrenergic receptor.

Interventions that can reduce viral shedding from the nasopharynx could potentially mitigate the severity of the disease and its contagiousness. Herbal formulation of Citrus medica and Zingiber officinale is recommended in an Ayurvedic text as a nasal rinse in the management of contagious fevers. These herbs are also indicated in the management of respiratory illnesses and have been attributed with activity against pathogenic organisms in other texts. Molecular docking studies of the phytocompounds of C. medica and Z. officinale were done to find out whether these compounds could inhibit the receptor binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) as well as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), as evidenced from their docking into binding/active sites. Results: The proteins of SARS-CoV-2, essential for its entry into human cells and highly expressed in the goblet and ciliated cells of nasal epithelium, play a significant role in contagiousness of the virus. Docking studies indicated that the specific compounds present in C. medica and Z. officinale have significant affinity in silico to spike protein of virus and ACE-2 receptor in the host.

211,misbelief,21631586,"Cigarette smoking is associated with an increased incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, we hypothesized that liquiritin apioside (LA), a main flavonoid component from Glycyrrhiza uralensis, had antioxidant properties by inducing glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis via the inhibition of cytokines and protected lung epithelial cells against cigarette smoke-mediated oxidative stress. A549 cells were treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and/or LA. ICR mice were exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) for four days with increasing exposure time for up to 6 h per day to elicit epithelial cells injury. One hour before smoke exposure, mice were treated with LA by gavage; 18 h after the last CS exposure all examinations were performed. Treatment with LA concentration-dependently prevented CSE-induced cytotoxicity, increase of TGF-β and TNF-α mRNA expression, depletion of GSH and apoptosis in A549 cells. LA at doses 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg dose-dependently inhibited pulmonary neutrophil and macrophage inflammation. Lung sections of the CS-exposed LA treated mice showed an apparently reduced pulmonary inflammation and a significant inhibitory effect on mucus containing goblet cells in the large airways. Furthermore, the CS-induced pulmonary release of TGF-β, TNF-α and myeloperoxidase activity was reduced, and superoxide dismutase activity was enhanced.These results indicate that protective roles of LA on CS-induced the lung epithelial cell injury are mediated by inhibiting TGF-β and TNF-α expression and increasing anti-oxidative levels of GSH, suggesting that LA might be effective as protective agent against epithelial injury in COPD.",Does licorice root help with cough?,licorice root help cough,1.0,Does licorice root help with cough?,0.9530013799667358

212,misbelief,29042288,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Native Americans used plants from the genus Echinacea to treat a variety of different inflammatory conditions including swollen gums, sore throats, skin inflammation, and gastrointestinal disorders. Today, various Echinacea spp. preparations are used primarily to treat upper respiratory infections. Aim of the study: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of an ethanolic E. purpurea (L) Moench root extract and the alkylamide dodeca-2E,4E-dienoic acid isobutylamide (A15) on mast cells, which are important mediators of allergic and inflammatory responses. Inhibition of mast cell activation may help explain the traditional use of Echinacea. Materials and methods: A15 was evaluated for its effects on degranulation, calcium influx, cytokine and lipid mediator production using bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) and the transformed rat basophilic leukemia mast cell line RBL-2H3. Methods included enzymatic assays, fluorimetry, ELISAs, and microscopy. A root extract of E. purpurea, and low and high alkylamide-containing fractions prepared from this extract, were also tested for effects on mast cell function. Finally, we tested A15 for effects on calcium responses in RAW 264.7 macrophage and Jurkat T cell lines. Results: A15 inhibited ß-hexosaminidase release from BMMCs and RBL-2H3 cells after treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 by 83.5% and 48.4% at 100µM, respectively. Inhibition also occurred following stimulation with IgE anti-DNP/DNP-HSA. In addition, A15 inhibited 47% of histamine release from A23187-treated RBL-2H3 cells. A15 prevented the rapid rise in intracellular calcium following FcεRI crosslinking and A23187 treatment suggesting it acts on the signals controlling granule release. An E. purpurea root extract and a fraction with high alkylamide content derived from this extract also displayed these activities while fractions with little to no detectable amounts of alkylamide did not. A15 mediated inhibition of calcium influx was not limited to mast cells as A23187-stimulated calcium influx was blocked in both RAW 264.7 and Jurkat cell lines with 60.2% and 43.6% inhibition at 1min post-stimulation, respectively. A15 also inhibited the release of TNF-α, and PGE 2 to a lesser degree, following A23187 stimulation indicating its broad activity on mast cell mediator production. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Echinacea extracts and alkylamides may be useful for treating allergic and inflammatory responses mediated by mast cells. More broadly, since calcium is a critical second messenger, the inhibitory effects of alkylamides on calcium uptake would be predicted to dampen a variety of pathological responses, suggesting new uses for this plant and its constituents.",Does echinacea boost immunity?,echinacea boost immunity,1.0,Does echinacea boost immunity?,0.944520115852356

The pathogenesis and complications advanced with infection mainly involve immune-inflammatory cascade. Therefore, the therapeutic strategy relies on immune modulation, reducing infectivity and inflammation. Given the interplay of infection and immune-inflammatory axis, the natural products received attention for preventive and therapeutic usage in COVID-19 due to their potent antiviral and anti-immunomodulatory activities. Recently, Echinacea preparations, particularly E. purpurea, have been suggested to be an important antiviral agent to be useful in COVID-19 by modulating virus entry, internalization and replication. In principle, the immune response and the resultant inflammatory process are important for the elimination of the infection, but may have a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and may play a role in the clinical spectrum of COVID-19. Considering the pharmacological effects, therapeutic potential, and molecular mechanisms of Echinacea , we hypothesize that it could be a reasonably possible candidate for targeting infection, immunity, and inflammation in COVID-19 with recent recognition of cannabinoid-2 (CB2) receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) mediated mechanisms of bioactive components that make them notable immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antiviral agent. The plausible reason for our hypothesis is that the presence of numerous bioactive agents in different parts of plants that may synergistically exert polypharmacological actions in regulating immune-inflammatory axis in COVID-19. Our proposition is to scientifically contemplate the therapeutic perspective and prospect of Echinacea on infection, immunity, and inflammation with a potential in COVID-19 to limit the severity and progression of the disease. Based on the clinical usage for respiratory infections, and relative safety in humans, further studies for the evidence-based approach to COVID-19 are needed.

Clinically, immunosenescence refers to the gradual deterioration of immune system that increases exposure to infections, and reduces vaccine efficacy. Such phenomenon is linked to impaired immune responses that lead to dysfunction of multiple organs, while lack of physical activity, progressive loss of muscle mass, and concomitant decline in muscle strength facilitate immunosenescence and inflammation. In the present review, we have discussed the role of nutrition and PA, which can boost the immune system alone and synergistically. Evidence suggests that long-term PA is beneficial in improving immune system and preventing various infections. We have further discussed several nutritional strategies for improving the immune system. Unfortunately, the available evidence shows conflicting results. In terms of interaction with food intake, PA does not tend to increase energy intake during a short time course. However, overcoming nutritional deficiencies appears to be the most practical recommendation. Through the balanced nutritious diet intake one can fulfill the bodily requirement of optimal nutrition that significantly impacts the immune system. Supplementation of a single nutrient as food is generally not advisable. Rather incorporating various fruits and vegetables, whole grains, proteins and probiotics may ensure adequate nutrient intake. Therefore, multi-nutrient supplements may benefit people having deficiency in spite of sufficient diet. Along with PA, supplementation of probiotics, bovine colostrum, plant-derived products and functional foods may provide additional benefits in improving the immune system.",Does echinacea boost immunity?,echinacea boost immunity,1.0,Does echinacea boost immunity?,0.9084018468856812

Activity was determined against selected viruses including, herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, parainfluenza virus type 3, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and human rhinovirus type 2. The order for virucidal activity generally was: ajoene &gt; allicin &gt; allyl methyl thiosulfinate &gt; methyl allyl thiosulfinate. Ajoene was found in oil-macerates of garlic but not in fresh garlic extracts. No activity was found for the garlic polar fraction, alliin, deoxyalliin, diallyl disulfide, or diallyl trisulfide. Fresh garlic extract, in which thiosulfinates appeared to be the active components, was virucidal to each virus tested. The predominant thiosulfinate in fresh garlic extract was allicin. Lack of reduction in yields of infectious virus indicated undetectable levels of intracellular antiviral activity for either allicin or fresh garlic extract. Furthermore, concentrations that were virucidal were also toxic to HeLa and Vero cells. Virucidal assay results were not influenced by cytotoxicity since the compounds were diluted below toxic levels prior to assaying for infectious virus. These results indicate that virucidal activity and cytotoxicity may have depended upon the viral envelope and cell membrane, respectively.

Garlic and its active organosulfur compounds (OSCs) have been reported to alleviate a number of viral infections in pre-clinical and clinical investigations. However, so far no systematic review on its antiviral effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms exists. Scope and approach: The aim of this review is to systematically summarize pre-clinical and clinical investigations on antiviral effects of garlic and its OSCs as well as to further analyse recent findings on the mechanisms that underpin these antiviral actions. PubMed, Cochrane library, Google Scholar and Science Direct databases were searched and articles up to June 2020 were included in this review. Key findings and conclusions: Pre-clinical data demonstrated that garlic and its OSCs have potential antiviral activity against different human, animal and plant pathogenic viruses through blocking viral entry into host cells, inhibiting viral RNA polymerase, reverse transcriptase, DNA synthesis and immediate-early gene 1(IEG1) transcription, as well as through downregulating the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The alleviation of viral infection was also shown to link with immunomodulatory effects of garlic and its OSCs.

Moreover, clinical studies proved an association between harmless upper respiratory tract infections and more severe diseases e.g. sinusitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Both the medicinal and socio-economic impact of HRV infections and the lack of antiviral drugs substantiate the need for intensive antiviral research. A common structural feature of the approximately 100 HRV serotypes is the icosahedrally shaped capsid formed by 60 identical copies of viral capsid proteins VP1-4. The capsid protects the single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome of about 7,400 bases in length. Both structural as well as nonstructural proteins produced during the viral life cycle have been identified as potential targets for blocking viral replication at the step of attachment, entry, uncoating, RNA and protein synthesis by synthetic or natural compounds. Moreover, interferon and phytoceuticals were shown to protect host cells. Most of the known inhibitors of HRV replication were discovered as a result of empirical or semi-empirical screening in cell culture. Structure-activity relationship studies are used for hit optimization and lead structure discovery. The increasing structural insight and molecular understanding of viral proteins on the one hand and the advent of innovative computer-assisted technologies on the other hand have facilitated a rationalized access for the discovery of small chemical entities with antirhinoviral (anti-HRV) activity.

The objective of this study was to determine if UV, ozone, and high pressure are effective technologies compared to traditional chlorine spray on green onions to reduce enteric viral pathogens and to determine the effect of location of the virus (surface or internalized) on the efficacy of these processes. Mature green onion plants were inoculated with murine norovirus (MNV), hepatitis A virus (HAV) and human adenovirus type 41 (Ad41) either on the surface through spot inoculation or through inoculating contaminated hydroponic solution allowing for uptake of the virus into the internal tissues. Inoculated green onions were treated with UV (240 mJ s/cm(2)), ozone (6.25 ppm for 10 min), pressure (500 MPa, for 5 min at 20°C), or sprayed with calcium hypochlorite (150 ppm, 4°C). Viral inactivation was determined by comparing treated and untreated inoculated plants using cell culture infectivity assays. Processing treatments were observed to greatly affect viral inactivation. Viral inactivation for all three viruses was greatest after pressure treatment and the lowest inactivation was observed after chlorine and UV treatment. Both surface inoculated viruses and viruses internalized in green onions were inactivated to some extent by these post-harvest processing treatments.

To determine the effect of water during HHP treatment on virus inactivation, a HuNoV surrogate, murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1), was inoculated onto green onions and then HHP-treated at 350MPa with or without water at 4 or 20°C. The presence of water enhanced HHP inactivation of MNV-1 on green onions at 4°C but not at 20°C. To test the temperature effect on HHP inactivation of MNV-1, inoculated green onions were HHP-treated at 300MPa at 1, 4 and 10°C. As the temperature decreased, MNV-1 became more sensitive to HHP treatment. HHP inactivation curves of MNV-1 on green onions and salsa were obtained at 300 or 350MPa for 0.5-3min at 1°C. All three inactivation curves showed a linear relationship between log reduction of MNV-1 and time. D values of HHP inactivation of MNV-1 on green onions were 1.10 and 0.61min at 300 and 350MPa, respectively. The D value of HHP inactivation of MNV-1 in salsa at 300MPa was 0.63min. HHP inactivation of HuNoV GI.1 and GII.4 on green onions and salsa was also conducted.

215,misbelief,34458058,"Onion yellow dwarf virus (OYDV) belonging to the genus Potyvirus , family Potyviridae, is one of the widely distributed viruses of Allium species worldwide. It causes dwarfing, yellow striping, crinkling and flaccidity of the leaves of onion and garlic. To see the occurrence and incidence of OYDV on Allium crop, an attempt was made to develop antibody based diagnostic assay which would be useful for routine indexing and screening of the germplasm. The total RNA was isolated from the symptomatic leaves of onion and the gene encoding coat protein (CP) was cloned. The nucleotide sequencing analysis of the cloned RT-PCR product revealed ~ 774 bp amplicon (OYDV CP) and it was further cloned in pET-28a ( +) expression vector which yielded ~ 30 kDa fusion protein with Histidine tag (His 6 BP). The expression of fusion CP was primarily checked on SDS-PAGE and further confirmed by Western blot. The His 6 BP-OYDV-CP was obtained in soluble state after purification and was used to immunize New Zealand white rabbit for the production of polyclonal antibody (PAb). The produced PAb against the purified fusion protein successfully detected OYDV from onion and garlic samples at 1:2000 dilutions in indirect-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAC-ELISA). Thus, this study presents first report that Histidine tag (His 6 BP) fusion OYDV-CP based antibody production and its successful application in identification of virus free onion and garlic genotypes.",Does onion kill viruses?,onion kill viruses,1.0,Does onion kill viruses?,0.7864494323730469

This work demonstrated the effects of low heat dehydration on inactivating hepatitis A virus (HAV) on contaminated green onions. Inoculated and uninoculated onion samples were dehydrated at target temperatures of 45-65 °C for 20 h. HAV from artificially contaminated onions (fresh or dehydrated) was eluted by shaking at 145 rpm at 20 °C for 20 min with 3% beef extract, pH 8, and followed by 0.2 μM-membrane filtration before plaque assay and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Dilutions of the filtrates were made for obtaining countable plaques on FRhK-4 cell monolayers in 6-well plates, and also for eliminating inhibitors in qRT-PCR. Average water activity of the onions after 20 h-dehydration was 0.227, regardless of temperature used (47.9 °C or 65.1 °C). Eight dehydration trials resulted in a linear relationship between HAV inactivation and dehydration temperature, with HAV log reduction = 0.1372x(°C) - 5.5572, r(2) = 0.88. Therefore, the 20 h-heating at 47.8, 55.1, and 62.4 °C reduced infectious HAV in onions by 1, 2, and 3 logs respectively, the Z value being 7.3 °C.

In particular, on 'Rossa di Tropea' onion, granted with Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) trademarks, this pathogen represents the most limiting biotic stress in terms of spread, severity of symptoms and damage, and its detection is necessary to preserve high quality standards and avoid yield losses. A reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed for detection of OYDV. The specificity, sensitivity, repeatability and reproducibility of the assay were validated according to EPPO standard PM7/98 (2). Diagnostic specificity, diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy were determined in both leaf and bulb tissues. To enhance the feasibility of a LAMP-based method for field diagnosis, several nucleic acid extraction methods were compared to simplify sample preparation. The results showed the reliability of the method for OYDV detection, with a limit of detection (LOD) comparable to real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The ease of sample preparation, and the more than acceptable LOD, indicated that the RT-LAMP assay could be used in plant pathology laboratories with limited facilities and resources, as well as directly in the field.

The structure of the fructan was characterised and elucidated by chemical and spectroscopic analyses. The fructan was composed of terminal (21.0%) and 2,1-linked β-D-Fruf residues (65.3%) with 1,6-linked β-D-Glcp residues (13.7%). The molecular weight of the polysaccharide and polydispersity was estimated to be 1.5×10(3) and 1.18, respectively. Although the fructan did not show anti-influenza A virus activity in vitro, it demonstrated an inhibitory effect on virus replication in vivo when it was orally administered to mice. In addition, the polysaccharide enhanced the production of neutralising antibodies against influenza A virus. Therefore, the antiviral mechanism of the polysaccharide seemed to be dependent on the host immune system, i.e., enhancement of the host immune function was achieved by the administration of the polysaccharide.

Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) vectored by Thrips tabaci Lindeman, is a major hindrance to onion production in eastern Africa. Control measures often rely on insecticides with deleterious effects. Endophytes are one key alternative as they can play important roles in mediating induced systemic resistance. Hence, we examined the potential effect of endophytic fungus Hypocrea lixii (F3ST1) on feeding and replication of IYSV on endophyte-colonized (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) onion plants. For more precise assessment, replication was also tested using leaf disk bioassays and individual thrips. The number of feeding punctures was significantly lower in E+ as compared to E- plants. Disease level was significantly lower in E+ as compared to E- plants for four weeks post-exposure to thrips. IYSV replication was reduced by 2.5-fold in endophytic treatment on both whole plant and leaf disk assays. Thrips tabaci showed 2 times higher feeding activities on endophyte-free onion leaf disks as compared to the endophyte-inoculated leaf disks. Our results suggest potential utility of the endophytes to reduce feeding damage and virus infection on onion plants. Further studies should be conducted to elucidate the secondary metabolites involved in such endophyte-thrips-virus mediated interaction and determine whether the interactions extend for this and other onion varieties and viruses under field conditions.",Does onion kill viruses?,onion kill viruses,1.0,Does onion kill viruses?,0.7692938446998596

These options may not be viable in organic production systems or situations where insecticide-resistant populations occur. Here we explore the efficacy of an attract and kill strategy for control of D. antiqua evaluating the ability of attractive, spinosad containing spheres to kill adult D. antiqua and reduce crop losses. Results: Spinosad containing spheres were able to consistently kill D. antiqua adults over the course of the field season (mortality range: between 49% and 59% on average). Pairing spinosad spheres with Delia Lure increased efficacy by 72% compared with the spheres alone. Performance of this attract and kill strategy also can reduce damage by D. antiqua larvae in the field, but it did not achieve a level of control comparable to the level provided by a conventional insecticide treatment. Conclusion: Implementation of this attract and kill strategy could be a valuable tool in situations where conventional pesticides are either not available or desired, where additional control techniques are needed, or to provide a season-long option for control of D. antiqua populations. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.",Does onion kill viruses?,onion kill viruses,1.0,Does onion kill viruses?,0.4822096526622772

Background: -Improved biomarkers for smoking are needed given its large public health impact and significant limitations of both self-report and current biomarkers, such as cotinine in detecting smoking. In the past 5 years, multiple epigenome-wide association studies of smoking have identified loci suitable for translation as epigenetic biomarkers for smoking, in particular the CpG cg05575921. Digital polymerase chain reaction methods hold promise for the development of this and other epigenetic biomarkers. Methods: -Participants in the Iowa Adoption Studies were interviewed regarding their smoking habits. DNA was prepared from whole blood and bisulfite-converted for methylation analysis and digital droplet polymerase chain reaction assay of methylation at cg05575921 was performed. National Death Index records were requested for 584 study participants, resulting in 24 complete matches, 210 partial matches and 350 non-matching records. Complete matches were coded as deceased while the remainder were coded as alive (ie, censored). In total, methylation data and vital status information were available for a total of N = 193 subjects, including 15 deceased and 178 non-deceased. Cox regression was used to examine the ability of cg05575921 methylation as a continuous value to predict the timing of mortality with and without the inclusion of age, sex, race, BMI, marital status, educational status, socioeconomic status, cardiovascular risk factors, and a history of cancer as covariates. Results: -Methylation at cg05575921 predicted the hazard of mortality as the sole predictor and after accounting for major demographic and clinical risk factors. The fitted model showed the hazard ratio increased by 3.5% for every 1% decrease in methylation. Conclusions: -Decreased methylation at cg05575921, an emerging epigenetic biomarker for smoking, was associated with early mortality in a longitudinal study of adults after accounting for the impact of major demographic and clinical risk factors for all-cause mortality.

The aim of present study was to analyse the effect of smoking on general and cause-specific mortality in the Estonian population. Methods: The data from 51,756 adults in the Estonian Genome Center of the University of Tartu was used. Information on dates and causes of death was retrieved from the National Causes of Death Registry. Smoking status, general survival, general mortality and cause-specific mortality were analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: The study found that smoking reduces median survival in men by 11.4 years and in women by 5.8 years. Tobacco smoking produces a very specific pattern in the cause of deaths, significantly increasing the risks for different cancers and cardiovascular diseases as causes of death for men and women. This study also identified that external causes, such as alcohol intoxication and intentional self-harm, are more prevalent causes of death among smokers than non-smokers. Additionally, smoking cessation was found to reverse the increased risks for premature mortality. Conclusions: Tobacco smoking remains the major cause for losses of life inducing cancers and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the common diseases, external causes also reduce substantially the years of life. External causes of death indicate that smoking has a long-term influence on the behaviour of smokers, provoking self-destructive behaviour.

Rates of current smoking among people living with HIV (PLHIV) are 2-3 times that of the general population, which contributes to the higher incidence of non-AIDS-related morbidity and mortality in PLHIV. Given the benefit of smoking cessation, strategies to assist individuals who smoke to quit should be a primary focus in modern HIV care. Tobacco harm reduction focuses on reducing health risk without necessarily requiring abstinence. However, there remains uncertainty about the safety, policy and familiarity of specific approaches, particularly the use of vaporised nicotine products. Evidence suggests that vaporised nicotine products may help smokers stop smoking and are not associated with any serious side-effects. However, there is the need for further safety and efficacy data surrounding interventions to assist quitting in the general population, as well as in PLHIV specifically. In addition, official support for vaping as a harm reduction strategy varies by jurisdiction and this determines whether medical practitioners can prescribe vaporised products and whether patients can access vaporised nicotine products. When caring for PLHIV who smoke, healthcare workers should follow general guidelines to assist with smoking cessation. These include: asking the patient about their smoking status; assessing the patient's readiness to quit and their nicotine dependence; advising the patient to stop smoking; assisting the patient in their attempt to stop smoking through referral, counselling, pharmacotherapy, self-help resources and/or health education; and arranging follow-up with the patient to evaluate their progress.",Does smoking cause death?,smoking causes death,1.0,Does smoking cause death?,0.7727099061012268

Recent studies have estimated smoking-attributable mortality using indirect approaches or with sample data that are not nationally representative and that lack key confounders. We use the 1990-2011 National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality Files to estimate relative risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for current and former smokers compared with never smokers. We examine causes of death established as attributable to smoking as well as additional causes that appear to be linked to smoking but have not yet been declared by the U.S. Surgeon General to be caused by smoking. Mortality risk is substantially elevated among smokers for established causes and moderately elevated for additional causes. We also decompose the mortality disadvantage among smokers by cause of death and estimate the number of smoking-attributable deaths for the U.S. adult population ages 35+, net of sociodemographic and behavioral confounders. The elevated risks translate to 481,887 excess deaths per year among current and former smokers compared with never smokers, 14 % to 15 % of which are due to the additional causes. The additional causes of death contribute to the health burden of smoking and should be considered in future studies of smoking-attributable mortality.

The exact impact of changes in smoking habits throughout life on different mortality risks is less studied. Methods: We studied the impact of baseline and lifetime smoking habits, and duration of smoking on the risk of all-cause mortality, mortality of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), any cancer and of the four most common types of cancer (lung, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer) in a cohort study (Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen 1965-1990, with a follow-up on mortality status until 2009, n = 8,645). We used Cox regression models adjusted for age, BMI, sex, and place of residence. Since previous studies suggested a potential effect modification of sex, we additionally stratified by sex and tested for interactions. In addition, to determine which cause of death carried the highest risk we performed competing-risk analyses on mortality due to CVD, cancer, COPD and other causes. Results: Current smoking (light, moderate, and heavy cigarette smoking) and lifetime persistent smoking were associated with an increased risk of all-cause, CVD, COPD, any cancer, and lung cancer mortality. Higher numbers of pack years at baseline were associated with an increased risk of all-cause, CVD, COPD, any cancer, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer mortality. Males who were lifetime persistent pipe/cigar smokers had a higher risk of lung cancer [HR (95% CI) = 7.72 (1.72-34.75)] as well as all-cause and any cancer mortality. A longer duration of smoking was associated with a higher risk of COPD, any and lung cancer [HR (95% CI) = 1.06 (1.00-1.12), 1.03 (1.00-1.06) and 1.10 (1.03-1.17) respectively], but not with other mortality causes. The competing risk analyses showed that ex- and current smokers had a higher risk of cancer, CVD, and COPD mortality compared to all other mortality causes. In addition, heavy smokers had a higher risk for COPD mortality compared to cancer, and CVD mortality. Conclusion: Our study indicates that lifetime numbers of cigarettes smoked and the duration of smoking have different impacts for different causes of mortality. Moreover, our findings emphasize the importance of smoking-related competing risks when studying the smoking-related cancer mortality in a general population and that smoking cessation immediately effectively reduces the risk of all-cause and any cancer mortality.",Does smoking cause death?,smoking causes death,1.0,Does smoking cause death?,0.900515615940094

2_h,health_belief,19896301,"Skin is affected by the aging process and numerous modifications are observed. In human, with time the skin becomes drier, thinner, spots appear, elasticity decreases and stiffening increases, together with the appearance of wrinkles. These observations result from the overlapping of an intrinsic chronological aging (individual, genetic) and of an extrinsic aging (dependent on external factors like UV, pollution and lifestyle). One of the causes of aging is the appearance of the Advanced Glycosylation End Products (AGEs) during life. The glycation reaction results from a non-enzymatic reaction between a sugar and a free amine group of Lys, Arg amino acids in proteins. This reaction does not occur only in the skin, indeed, AGEs are also found in the kidney, lens, vessels, etc. These products are also responsible, because of their localization, of some pathologies related to diabetes. AGEs provoke biological modifications implying an activation of molecules synthesis (extracellular matrix, cytokines) and enzyme activation of matrix degradation (metalloproteinases). The UV effect on AGEs (like pentosidine) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the extracellular matrix which could lead to additional deleterious effects. Molecules are described in the literature as inhibitors to this irreversible reaction i.e. aminoguanidine. To understand the consequences of the glycation in the skin, a system of reconstructed skin was developed with a collagen modified by glycation for the dermal component. In this system we observed that dermis and epidermis are both modified due to glycation (macromolecules synthesis, cytokines, metalloproteinases) and it is possible to test inhibitors of this reaction.

The most intuitive consequence of aging is mainly manifested on the skin, resulting in cumulative changes in skin structure, function and appearance, such as increased wrinkles, laxity, elastosis, telangiectasia, and aberrant pigmentation of the skin. Unlike other organs of the human body, skin is not only inevitably affected by the intrinsic aging process, but also affected by various extrinsic environmental factors to accelerate aging, especially ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Skin aging is a highly complex and not fully understood process, and the lack of universal biomarkers for the definitive detection and evaluation of aging is also a major research challenge. Oxidative stress induced by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to lipid, protein, nucleic acid and organelle damage, thus leading to the occurrence of cellular senescence, which is one of the core mechanisms mediating skin aging. Autophagy can maintain cellular homeostasis when faced with different stress conditions and is one of the survival mechanisms of cell resistance to intrinsic and extrinsic stress.

Although mortality from skin disease is primarily restricted to melanoma, dermatological disorders are ubiquitous in older people with a significant impact on quality of life. The structural and functional deterioration of the skin that occurs with age has numerous clinical presentations, ranging from benign but potentially excruciating disorders like pruritus to the more threatening carcinomas and melanomas. Recent advances: The degenerative changes that occur in the aging skin are increasingly understood at both the molecular and cellular level, facilitating a deeper understanding of the structural and functional deterioration that these changes produce. Critical issues: A loss of both function and structural stability in skin proceeds unavoidably as individuals age, which is the result of both intrinsic and extrinsic processes, which contribute simultaneously to a progressive loss of skin integrity. Intrinsic aging proceeds at a genetically determined pace, primarily caused by the buildup of damaging products of cellular metabolism as well as an increasing biological aging of the cells. Estrogen levels strongly influence skin integrity in women as well; falling levels in midlife, therefore, produce premature aging as compared with similarly aged men.

Ordinal grading on a nine-point scale (0 = none, 1-3 = mild, 4-6 = moderate, 7-9 = severe) of facial fine lines, molted pigmentation, uneven skin tone, tactile roughness, global firmness appearance, jaw-line contour, radiance, and overall appearance was performed by investigator at baseline, week 1, week 4, week 8, and week 12. Digital photography, ultrasound, cutometry, and corneometry measurements were also performed at each time point. Results: Twenty-nine of 30 subjects successfully completed the study. No tolerability issues were reported. The clinical investigator found statistically significant improvements in wrinkles, tactile roughness, pore size, radiance, and overall appearance at week 1 time point (P ≤ 0.05) against baseline and statistically significant improvements in mottled pigmentation, global firmness, and jaw-line contour at week 4 time point (P ≤ 0.05) against baseline. Cutometry, corneometry, and ultrasound measurements showed significant improvements at week 12 time point (P ≤ 0.05) against baseline. Conclusion: Based on the findings from this study, it can be concluded that salicin has the ability to reduce the visible signs of skin aging when applied topically.",Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,Does skin product cause aging?,0.8928437232971191

Skin changes associated with aging have been assuming an important role in nowadays and bring to affect the quality of life. Intense Pulsed Light (ILP) is a noncollimated, polychromatic, and noncoherent non-surgical cosmetic therapy to skin rejuvenation. This is the first systematic review evaluating ILP treatment on skin rejuvenation evaluated by digital photographs and self-reported treatment efficacy. A PRISMA compliant review includes a search of the databases Scopus and PubMed. Sixteen studies treating 637 participants (with Fitzpatrick skin types I to IV and age varying from 21 to 80 years) were included. Patients were treated a mean of 4.29 sessions (range 3-7). The most studies results showed the efficacy of IPL treatment in telangiectasia, wrinkles, pore, erythema, rhytids, texture, lentigines, hiperpigmentation, and photoaging score. Six studies showed IPL-positive effects in association with other treatment and seven studies showed superior effect of other treatment or association to IPL with other treatment related to IPL alone. Nine studies showed low methodological quality. In conclusion, ILP treatment is effective on skin rejuvenation.

Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to this complex biological process of skin aging. In recent times, skin health and its beauty is perceived as an indicator of one's health which has resulted in an increasing demand for anti-aging products. Exposure to UV radiation is considered to be one of the factors responsible for aging termed as photoaging. In this review, we have discussed the various factors which may accelerate the process of skin aging. Various approaches and strategies to delay the process of skin aging have been emphasized upon. The patents filed in the area of anti-aging and sunscreen products have also been reviewed to gain an insight into the new formulations which have been developed as an anti-aging product. There has been a tremendous rise in the cosmetic and cosmeceuticals market with products having a dual activity of anti-aging and sun protection.

Aging cells cease to divide and drive the progression of illness through various pathways. Over the years, a number of anti-aging medicines of natural and synthetic origin have been introduced. Indeed, some studies have identified senescent cells as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of aging and age-related diseases. Areas covered: In this review, the authors highlight and critically review the possible mechanisms of the aging process and related illnesses. The authors give particular attention to illnesses, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, skin aging and cardiovascular diseases. Expert opinion: Several reports have highlighted that mitochondria are a key factor in the progression of aging and neurodegenerative illnesses. This is due to their production of extra amounts of reactive oxygen species, which leads into progressive caspase-dependent apoptosis and cell death. Therefore, strategies to prevent/reduce oxidative stress-mediated aging, whether environmental, nutritional and pharmacological, need to be taken into account. Presently, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, which focus on the evolutionary and genetic foundations of aging, have helped to establish the screening of several synthetic and natural compounds with large cohorts in a quick manner. However, there is yet to be any efficient experimental evidence to prove the exact role of senescent cells in age-related dysfunction and further studies are required to better understand these processes.",Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,Does skin product cause aging?,0.6273859143257141

The conventional treatments accessible after diagnosis, have the main goal of controlling the disease, by improving survival. In more advance stages the aim is to prolong life and symptom palliation care. Surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are the main options available, which must be adapted to each person individually. However, patients are developing resistance to the conventional therapies.

For a better understanding of the experience of symptoms associated with chemotherapy and the development of targeted interventions, this study aimed to (a) explore the patient experience of chemotherapy, (b) identify patients' strategies to cope with the side effects and distress and (c) explore the link between their experience and coping strategies. Methods: Qualitative studies were included if they explored the experience or coping strategies of women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. Instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute were used to critically appraise the methodological quality, extract data and aggregate findings from the included studies. Results: Twelve studies presenting findings from 184 women with breast cancer who had received chemotherapy were included in this review. Three synthesized findings were identified from 8 categories based on 91 original findings: (1) Women living with chemotherapy experienced various stressful side effects, and their lives were changed. (2) Supportive care to address needs is essential to help women get through this difficult time. (3) They engaged in numerous types of coping strategies to deal with side effects and adapt to this difficult journey. Moreover, the link between experience of chemotherapy and coping strategies is based on the Lazarus' stress and coping theory. Conclusions: Although the experience of women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy is individualized, we concluded that the distressing experience related to chemotherapy as a stimulus was viewed as a stressor that demands coping or adaptation. Based on the Lazarus stress and coping theory, the ability of a woman to appraise how chemotherapy changed her life and how she appraises her resources to cope with chemotherapy are essential.

Method: Single-case analysis of a recorded surgical consultation, using conversation analysis. Results: The surgeon not only negotiates the surgical treatment decision with the patient, she provides an overview of what her non-surgical treatment is likely to entail. Analysis reveals how the surgeon addresses interactional challenges when providing this overview, including how to broach the rationale for administering chemotherapy, the possibility that cancer could spread to vital organs and prove fatal. To do this, the surgeon orients to the possibility that the patient has misconceptions about her risk of dying from breast cancer. She uses negatively-formulated assertions to invoke these possible misconceptions, making correction relevant and providing a point of entry into delicate interactional territory. Conclusion: The surgeon draws upon possible patient misconceptions to broach the rationale for administering adjuvant chemotherapy.

The data included 96% of the population. The data were analyzed by age groups, regions, hospital levels and insurance schemes in breast cancer patients. Results: Admissions from breast cancer occurred for 35,490 in the year 2010. Admissions for systemic chemotherapy accounted for 53.1% of all breast cancer admissions and accounted for 17.3% of all admissions for chemotherapy. Most of chemotherapy admissions were in tertiary care hospital level. Mean length of stay for chemotherapy in breast cancer was 2.33 days compared to 5.30 days in other cancers.

Because of the pharmacologic properties of nicotine and other constituents of smokeless tobacco, there is also concern that smokeless tobacco products may lead to cardiovascular diseases as well. The relatively few human population studies to date conflict with respect to whether smokeless tobacco use elevates cardiovascular risk factors or leads to cardiovascular disease or death from cardiovascular causes. Hemoglobin adducts to carcinogens present in smokeless tobacco products are measurable in the blood of smokeless tobacco users, indicating that smokeless-tobacco-related carcinogens circulate throughout the body.

Materials and methods: In this prospective study, a total of 25 cases of leukoplakia, 25 of tobacco pouch keratosis, and 50 of healthy controls were studied. Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) for the identification of Candida and HiCrome Candida differential Agar for the species identification of Candida were used. Calculation of salivary flow rate, pH, and buffer capacity was done with Saliva-Check Buffer kit (GC). Results: The prevalence of Candida carriage obtained was considerably greater in the study group associated with smokeless tobacco use. Non Candida albicans Candida species predominated over Candida albicans in speciation among study groups on HiCrome agar and Candida albicans predominated among control groups. Statistically significant values were obtained by comparing the salivary flow rate, pH, and buffer capacity between the study groups and control groups. Conclusion: The present study indicated Candida prevalence was seen more in study group than healthy control groups, suggesting increased Candida in smokeless tobacco users. The prevalence of Non Candida albicans Candida species among leukoplakia and tobacco pouch keratosis indicates that there is pervasiveness of significant Non Candida albican Candida species in relation to salivary flow rate and buffer capacity.

Smokeless tobacco is very strongly related to cancers of the cheek and gums, locations typically in direct contact with the tobacco. The association is evident in studies in the US and Scandinavia and also in Asia, where the chewing of quids containing tobacco and other ingredients is strongly related to the region's high rates of oral cancer. Reports on health effects date back to the 18th century and the evidence is consistent, with most investigators reporting positive findings. Dose-response relationships--increasing risk with increasing use--are also evident in several studies. Finally, preliminary work on cancers in other anatomic sites suggests that smokeless tobacco may also be related to other upper digestive tract cancers. With the exception of one group of medical scientists who described the relationship as only an ""association,"" expert consensus conferences and committees in both the US and France have agreed that the evidence from clinical, epidemiologic, and carcinogenesis studies supports a causal relationship between the use of smokeless tobacco and oral cancer in humans.

We describe key processes in the onset of a 'simple' depression and show that kindling and depressive diatheses reproduce many of the neurobiological features of depression. We also review the neurobiological mechanisms of antidepressant drug action, and show that resistance to antidepressant treatment is associated with genetic and other factors that are largely similar to those implicated in vulnerability to depression.

Depression is correlated with atrophy of neurons in the cortical and limbic brain regions that control mood and emotion. Antidepressant therapy can exhibit effects on neuroplasticity and reverse the neuroanatomical changes found in depressed patients. The investigation of fast-acting agents that reverse behavioral and neuronal deficiencies of chronic depression, especially the glutamate receptor antagonist NMDA ketamine, and the cellular mechanisms underlying the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine and related agents are of real interest in current research.

According to the obtained results, the daily oral administration of Rb1 (35 and 70 mg/kg) and imipramine (15 mg/kg) for 28 days significantly reversed the social avoidance behavior, anhedonia, and behavioral despair via CSDS exposure, as demonstrated by the considerable elevation in the time in the zone in the social interaction test, consumption of sucrose solution in the sucrose preference test, and decrease in immobility time in the forced swim test. Moreover, Rb1 obviously restored the CSDS-induced decrease in the BDNF signaling pathway and hippocampal neurogenesis. Rb1 significantly increased the hippocampal levels of ERK, AKT, and CREB phosphorylation and increased the number of DCX+ cells in DG. Importantly, the antidepressant effects of Rb1 were completely blocked in mice by using K252a (the nonselective tyrosine kinase B inhibitor).

6_h,health_belief,24300695,"Chronic stressful life events are risk factors for developing major depression, the pathophysiology of which is strongly linked to impairments in serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission. Exposure to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) has been found to induce depressive-like behaviours, including passive behavioural coping and anhedonia in animal models, along with many other affective, cognitive, and behavioural symptoms. The heterogeneity of these symptoms represents the plurality of corticolimbic structures involved in mood regulation that are adversely affected in the disorder. Chronic stress has also been shown to negatively regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a phenomenon that is involved in antidepressant effects and regulates subsequent stress responses. Although there exists an enormous body of data on stress-induced alterations of 5-HT activity, there has not been extensive exploration of 5-HT adaptations occurring presynaptically or at the level of the raphe nuclei after exposure to CUS. Similarly, although hippocampal neurogenesis is known to be negatively regulated by stress and positively regulated by antidepressant treatment, the role of neurogenesis in mediating affective behaviour in the context of stress remains an active area of investigation. The goal of this review is to link the serotonergic and neurogenic hypotheses of depression and antidepressant effects in the context of stress. Specifically, chronic stress significantly attenuates 5-HT neurotransmission and 5-HT1A autoreceptor sensitivity, and this effect could represent an endophenotypic hallmark for mood disorders. In addition, by decreasing neurogenesis, CUS decreases hippocampal inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, exacerbating stress axis overactivity. Similarly, we discuss the possibility that adult hippocampal neurogenesis mediates antidepressant effects via the ventral (in rodents; anterior in humans) hippocampus' influence on the HPA axis, and mechanisms by which antidepressants may reverse chronic stress-induced 5-HT and neurogenic changes. Although data are as yet equivocal, antidepressant modulation of 5-HT neurotransmission may well serve as one of the factors that could drive neurogenesis-dependent antidepressant effects through these stress regulation-related mechanisms.",Does antidepressant cause depression?,antidepressant causes depression,1.0,Does antidepressant cause depression?,0.9398090839385986

As depression is likely to be a heterogeneous disorder, it is possible that existing neurotransmitter-based antidepressant drugs do not fully address other pathologies that may exist in certain cases. Biological pathologies related to depression that have been proposed and studied extensively include inflammation and immunology, hypercortisolemia, oxidative stress, and impaired angiogenesis. Such pathologies may induce neurodegeneration, which in turn causes cognitive impairment, a symptom increasingly being recognized in depression. A neurotoxic brain hypothesis unifying all these factors may explain the heterogeneity of depression as well as cognitive decline and antidepressant drug resistance in some patients. Compared with neurotransmitter-based antidepressant drugs, many botanical compounds in traditional medicine used for the treatment of depression and its related symptoms have been discovered to be anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, anti-infection, antioxidative, and proangiogenic. Some botanical compounds also exert actions on neurotransmission.

6_h,health_belief,25514751,"Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, yet it remains difficult to understand the mechanistic provocations and to intervene therapeutically. Stress is recognized as a frequent precursor to suicide. Psychological stress is well established to cause activation of the inflammatory response, including causing neuroinflammation, an increase of inflammatory molecules in the central nervous system (CNS). Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as affecting many aspects of CNS functions and behaviors. In particular, much evidence demonstrates that inflammatory markers are elevated in traits that have been linked to suicidal behavior, including aggression, impulsivity and depression. Lithium is recognized as significantly reducing suicidal behavior, is anti-inflammatory and diminishes aggression, impulsivity and depression traits, each of which is associated with elevated inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effects of lithium result from its inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). GSK3 has been demonstrated to strongly promote inflammation, aggressive behavior in rodents and depression-like behaviors in rodents, whereas regulation of impulsivity by GSK3 has not yet been investigated. Altogether, evidence is building supporting the hypothesis that stress activates GSK3, which in turn promotes inflammation, and that inflammation is linked to behaviors associated with suicide, including particularly aggression, impulsivity and depression. Further investigation of these links may provide a clearer understanding of the causes of suicidal behavior and provide leads for the development of effective preventative interventions, which may include inhibitors of GSK3.",Does antidepressant cause depression?,antidepressant causes depression,1.0,Does antidepressant cause depression?,0.9710379242897034

Recent studies suggest that psychological stress can modulate the sickness response. However, it remains uncertain whether acute and chronic psychosocial stresses have the same effect on viral infection-induced sickness responses. To address this question, we compared changes in polyI:C-induced sickness responses, such as fever, change of body weight and food intake, mechanical allodynia, and depressive-like behavior, in rats that had been pre-exposed to single and repeated social defeat stresses. Intraperitoneal injection of polyI:C induced a maximal fever of 38.0°C 3h after injection. Rats exposed to prior social defeat stress exhibited blunted febrile responses, which were more pronounced in the repeated stress group. Furthermore, only the repeated stress group showed late-onset and prolonged mechanical allodynia lasting until 8days after injection in the von Frey test and prolonged immobility time in the forced swim test 9days post-injection. To assess the role of glucocorticoids and microglia in the delayed and persistent development of these sickness responses in rats exposed to repeated stress, we investigated the effect of pretreatment with RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, and minocycline, an inhibitor of microglial activation, on polyI:C-induced allodynia and depressive-like behavior. Pretreatment with either drug inhibited both the delayed allodynia and depressive-like behavior. The present study demonstrates that repeated, but not single, social defeat stress followed by systemic polyI:C administration induced prolonged allodynia and depressive-like behavior in rats. Our results show that even though a single-event psychosocial stress does not have any effect by itself, animals may develop persistent allodynia and depressive-like behavior when they suffer from an infectious disease if they are pre-exposed to repeated or chronic psychosocial stress. Furthermore, this study suggests that stress-induced corticosterone and microglial activation play a pivotal role in this phenomenon.",Does stress cause sickness?,stress causes sickness,1.0,Does stress cause sickness?,0.9430882930755615

Taking this assumption into account, we experimentally induced sickness behavior in rats using lipopolysaccharides (LPS), an endotoxin that mimics infection by gram-negative bacteria, and then exposed these rats to a restraint stress challenge. Zinc has been shown to play a regulatory role in the immune and nervous systems.

LPS administration induced sickness behavior in rats compared to controls, i.e., decreases in the distance traveled, average velocity, rearing frequency, self-grooming, and number of vocalizations, as well as an increase in the plasma levels of TNF-α, compared with controls after a stressor challenge. LPS also decreased BDNF expression but did not influence anxiety parameters.

Methods: After having verified the state of art concerning the function of cortisol, norepinephrine (NE), interleukin (IL)-1β and melatonin, we describe as they work together. Results: We propose a speculative hypothesis concerning the complex interplay of these signaling molecules during chronic stress, highlighting the role of IL-1β as main biomarker of this effects, indeed, during chronic stress its increment transforms this inflammatory signal into a nervous signal (NE), in turn, this uses the ES (melatonin and cortisol) to counterbalance again IL-1β. During cortisol resistance, a vicious loop occurs that increments all mediators, unbalancing IS, ES, and CNS networks. This IL-1β increase would occur above all when the individual succumbs to stressful events, showing the Sickness Behaviour Symptoms.

Psychological stress brings about certain physiological changes through manipulation of the neural, humoral and immunological systems. Observational studies have showed that fear and anxiety before surgery can complicate normal wound healing. Two different pathways appear to be involved: one directly through hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic-adrenomedullary axis, and another indirectly through negative psychological stressors such as anxiety, depression and social isolation. The pathogenesis includes decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in poor angiogenesis, matrix regeneration and delayed healing. Prolonged immunological activation in itself is a stressor and can precipitate a sickness behaviour syndrome manifested by disturbed sleep, anorexia, reduction in activity, increased responsiveness to pain and addiction to alcohol and tobacco. It has been observed that cortisol release suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine release, while down-regulation of cortisol causes unabated inflammatory response. In individuals with chronic wounds, on the other hand, it is thought that physical stress has different effects such as foul odor, pain, exudate and social and familial isolation, which may act independently as psychological stressors.

Some antipsychotic and antianxiety agents induce alopecia. Hair loss is also related to hypothyroidism, which can be induced by lithium and other agents. Alopecia might not be reported by some people, but physicians should be aware of this potential problem which may contribute to noncompliance. Lithium causes hair loss in 12-19% of long-term users. Valproic acid and/ or divalproex precipitates alopecia in up to 12% of patients in a dose-dependent relationship. Incidences up to 28% are observed with high valproate concentration exposures. These pharmaceuticals also can change hair color and structure. The occurrence of carbamazepine-induced alopecia is at or below 6%. Hair loss is less common with other mood stabilizers. Tricyclic antidepressants, maprotilene, trazodone, and virtually all the new generation of antidepressants may on rare occasions lead to alopecia. The same applies to haloperidol, olanzepine, risperidone, clonazepam, and buspirone, but not to other neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates, selected antihistamines, and antiparkinsonians.

Drug-induced alopecia is usually described as a diffuse non-scarring alopecia which is reversible upon withdrawal of the drug. Only a few drugs (mainly antimitotic agents) routinely cause hair loss whereas many drugs may be the cause of isolated cases of alopecia. Some psychotropic drugs are likely to induce a drug-related alopecia. Case reports with tricyclic antidepressants rarely appear in the literature. It has been reported that 15 per cent of patients taking lithium developed hair thinning. Hair loss is reported secondary to some anticonvulsant agents mainly valproic acid. Among antihypertensive drugs, systemic or topic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists should be considered as possible causes of hair loss. Hair loss from salicylates or nonsteroidal analgesics occurs in a very small percentage of patients. All anticoagulant and antithyroid drugs can produce hair loss. Diffuse hair loss can also be associated with the use of oral contraceptives, while receiving the pill and after stopping the drug. There is a long list of drugs that on occasion have been cited as causing hair loss: cimetidine, retinoids, amphetamines, bromocriptine and levodopa. A few isolated cases have been reported with some hypocholesterolaemic or anti-infectious agents. Diagnosis of drug-induced alopecia remains difficult.

However, it has been shown that it is the loss of microbial diversity in the skin and the imbalance among C. acnes phylotypes that brings about acne rather than the C. acnes species as a whole. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that other microorganisms may be implicated, such as the fungi Malassezia and the bacteria Cutibacterium granulosum. A plethora of scientific evidence suggests that the gut microbiome is implicated in the overall health and physiology of the host; studies show that the gut microbiome of acne patients is distinct and depicts less microbial diversity compared to individuals without acne. Herein, using the key terms: acne, C. acnes, IGF-1, sebum, and gut microbiome, we carried out a review of the literature, using Google Scholar and PubMed, and discussed the role of the gut and skin microbiome in relation to acne, as a narrative review.

We evaluated the pooled odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random effects model. Subgroup analyses on acne severity, milk forms and milk intake levels were performed. Results: Compared with non-consumers, the pooled OR was 1.16 (95% CI 1.09-1.24) for overall milk consumers in all included studies, and 1.17 (95% CI 1.10-1.24) in cohort studies and 1.16 (95% CI 1.09-1.24) in case-control or cross-sectional studies. Subgroup analysis on milk forms determined a stronger association in skim milk consumers (OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.37) than in low-fat consumers (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.08-1.22) and full-fat consumers (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.05-1.21).

9_h,health_belief,21335995,"Acne vulgaris, the most common skin disease of western civilization, has evolved to an epidemic affecting more than 85% of adolescents. Acne can be regarded as an indicator disease of exaggerated insulinotropic western nutrition. Especially milk and whey protein-based products contribute to elevations of postprandial insulin and basal insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) plasma levels. It is the evolutional principle of mammalian milk to promote growth and support anabolic conditions for the neonate during the nursing period. Whey proteins are most potent inducers of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide secreted by enteroendocrine K cells which in concert with hydrolyzed whey protein-derived essential amino acids stimulate insulin secretion of pancreatic β-cells. Increased insulin/IGF-I signaling activates the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt pathway, thereby reducing the nuclear content of the transcription factor FoxO1, the key nutrigenomic regulator of acne target genes. Nuclear FoxO1 deficiency has been linked to all major factors of acne pathogenesis, i.e. androgen receptor transactivation, comedogenesis, increased sebaceous lipogenesis, and follicular inflammation. The elimination of the whey protein-based insulinotropic mechanisms of milk will be the most important future challenge for nutrition research.

9_h,health_belief,19243483,"Consumption of cow's milk and cow's milk protein result in changes of the hormonal axis of insulin, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) in humans. Milk consumption raises IGF-1 serum levels in the perinatal period, adolescence and adulthood. During puberty with the physiological onset of increased secretion of growth hormone, IGF-1 serum levels increase and are further enhanced by milk consumption. IGF-1 is a potent mitogen; after binding to its receptor in various tissues, it induces cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. Keratinocytes and sebocytes, as well as the androgen-synthesizing adrenals and gonads, are stimulated by IGF-1. The epidemic incidence of adolescent acne in Western milk-consuming societies can be explained by the increased insulin- and IGF-1-stimulation of sebaceous glands mediated by milk consumption. Acne can be regarded as a model for chronic Western diseases with pathologically increased IGF-1-stimulation. Many other organs, such as the thymus, bones, all glands, and vascular smooth muscle cells as well as neurons are subject to this abnormally increased hormonal stimulation. The milk-induced change of the IGF-1-axis most likely contributes to the development of fetal macrosomia, induction of atopy, accelerated linear growth, atherosclerosis, carcinogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases.

A close look at the scientific literature shows a striking contradiction. On the one hand, experimental studies of surrogate markers (e.g., bone turnover markers and bone mineral density [BMD]) usually indicate benefits from drinking cow's milk. On the other, the findings from epidemiological studies are conflicting and disconcerting. In all age groups, including children and postmenopausal women, consuming cow's milk, powdered milk supplements, or whey protein is associated with a slower bone turnover and unchanged or higher BMD values. These benefits are particularly marked in populations where calcium deficiency is prevalent, for instance in Asian countries. No interventional studies have addressed the fracture risk potentially associated with drinking cow's milk. The only available data come from epidemiological observational studies, whose results are conflicting, with a lower fracture risk in some cases and no difference or a higher risk in others. Several hypotheses have been offered to explain these findings, such as a deleterious effect of D-galactose, lactose intolerance, and acid overload. Epidemiological studies face many obstacles when seeking to detect effects of a single food, particularly the multiplicity of interactions among foods. Furthermore, reliable dietary intake data must be collected over prolonged periods, often long before the occurrence of a fracture, and defective recall may therefore introduce a major yet often unrecognized bias, particularly in populations where calcium deficiency is uncommon.

Consumption of milk and dairy products in Japanese is still low, and it is important to keep our mind to increase its consumption for bone health.",Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,0.6376634836196899

Additionally, it is estimated that 0.3 million and 1.7 million people have hip fractures in the USA and Europe, respectively. Having a proper peak bone mass and keeping it as long as possible is especially important for osteoporosis prevention. One of the most important calcium sources is milk and dairy products. Breast milk is the best infant food, but milk should not be avoided later in life to prevent losing bone mass. On the other hand, more and more people limit their milk consumption and consume other dairy or non-dairy products. For example, they are usually replaced with plant beverages, which should be consumed carefully in several age groups. Additionally, an important element of milk and dairy products, as well as plant beverages, are probiotics and prebiotics, which may modulate bone turnover.

10_h,health_belief,33072800,"Increasing peak bone mass during adolescence and reducing bone loss in later life are two approaches to reduce the risk of osteoporosis with aging. Osteoporosis affects a large proportion of the elderly population worldwide and the incidence is increasing. Milk consumption is an accepted strategy in building peak bone mass and therefore may reduce the risk of osteoporosis. In childhood calcium, phosphorous, and growth factors are the important components to support bone growth but in adults the positive influence on bone density/maintenance may also be due to other bioactive proteins/peptides or lipids in milk acting directly in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Lactose has been known to increase calcium absorption; galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are derived from lactose and are non-digestible oligosaccharides. They have been shown to improve mineral balance and bone properties as well as causing increases in bifidobacteria in the gut, therefore a prebiotic effect. Supplementation with fortified milk and dairy products with added prebiotics, increased both calcium and magnesium absorption and caused some modulation of gut microbiota in animals and humans. Fermented milk is now also recognized to contain highly active components such as vitamins, peptides, oligosaccharides, and organic acids. In this review, the role of milk and milk components in improving calcium absorption and thereby supporting bone health is discussed. In addition, some reference is made to the significance of combining the inherent beneficial components from milk with fortificants/nutrients that will support bone health through adulthood.

10_h,health_belief,32532150,"Vitamin D and calcium are important dietary compounds that affect bone mass, even if other minerals (potassium, zinc, etc.) and vitamins (A, C and K) are also involved. Vitamin D and certain minerals, in fact, play an important role in calcium homeostasis and calcium absorption. Hip fracture incidence is higher in Europe and the United States, where calcium is frequently included in the human diet; while the occurrence of these fractures is lower in developing countries, where diets are often poor in calcium. This condition is named the ""calcium paradox"", and may be partially explained by phosphate toxicity, which can negatively affect mineral metabolism. It is important to maintain correct dietary calcium-phosphate balance in order to have a healthy life, reducing the risk of osteoporotic fractures in older people. Vitamin D can also act as a hormone; vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is derived from the UV-B radiation of ergosterol, the natural vitamin D precursor detected in plants, fungi, and invertebrates. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is synthesized by sunlight exposure from 7-dehydrocholesterol, a precursor of cholesterol that can also act as provitamin D3. Dietary intake of vitamin D3 is essential when the skin is exposed for short periods to ultraviolet B light (UV-B), a category of invisible light rays such as UV-A and UV-C. This can be considered the usual situation in northern latitudes during the winter season, or the typical lifestyle for older people and/or for people with very white delicate skin. The actual recommended daily intake of dietary vitamin D is strictly correlated with age, ranging from 5 μg for infants, children, teenagers, and adults-including pregnant and lactating women-to 15 μg for people over 65 years.",Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,0.580214262008667
10_h,health_belief,19172341,"Current treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis suffer from side effects. Safe and natural milk proteins, ribonuclease, and lactoferrin promote formation of new capillaries and bone formation. A ribonuclease-enriched lactoferrin supplement studied here, demonstrates significant reduction in resorption and increase in formation, towards restoring the balance of bone turnover within 6 months. Introduction: Osteoporosis, a major health issue among postmenopausal women, causes increased bone resorption and reduced bone formation. A reduction in angiogenesis could also contribute to this imbalance. Current treatments such as hormone replacement therapy and bisphosphonates have drawbacks of severe side effects. Milk ribonuclease (RNase) is known to promote angiogenesis and lactoferrin (LF) to stimulate bone formation by osteoblasts. We examine the effect of ribonuclease-enriched lactoferrin supplement on the bone health of postmenopausal women. Methods: A total of 38 healthy, postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 60 years were randomized into placebo or RNAse-enriched-LF (R-ELF) supplement groups. The bone health status was monitored by assessing bone resorption markers, serum N-telopeptides (NTx), and urine deoxypyridinoline (Dpd) crosslinks and serum bone formation markers, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and osteocalcin (OC). Results: R-ELF supplementation demonstrated a decrease in urine Dpd levels by 14% (19% increase for placebo) and serum NTx maintained at 24% of the baseline (41% for placebo), while serum BAP and OC levels showed a 45% and 16% elevation (25% and 5% for placebo). Conclusions: R-ELF supplementation demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in bone resorption and increase in osteoblastic bone formation, to restore the balance of bone turnover within a short period.",Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,0.8873162269592285
10_h,health_belief,32563771,"Objectives: Limiting the consumption of milk and dairy products (DPs) constitutes a risk factor for osteoporosis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) and the frequency of osteopenia and osteoporosis in patients with IBD. We also investigated the correlation between BMD and consumption of milk and DPs, as well as with calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] serum concentration levels. Methods: The study comprised 208 patients with IBD. Densitometric measurements were performed using the dual-energy x-ray absorpiometry. Before (IBD-I) and after the diagnosis (IBD-II) of IBD, we used a questionnaire to assess the consumption of milk and DPs. Serum concentrations of PTH, 25(OH)D, calcium, and phosphate were determined. Results: The prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in the IBD patient group was 48.1%. At the same time, 87% of patients with IBD reported milk consumption. Patients from this group with proper bone mass amounted to 91.7%, whereas patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis comprised 82% (P = 0.0382) of patients. In patients with IBD who consumed milk, femoral neck BMD (0.97 ± 0.17 g/cm<sup>2</sup>) was higher than in those not drinking milk (0.897 ± 0.154 g/cm<sup>2</sup>; P = 0.0587). The percentage of patients with IBD consuming DPs was 96.2%; however, this number decreased after diagnosis and was equal to IBD-II: 83% (P 0.0001). Additionally, concentration levels of 25(OH)D decreased in the IBD group (21.82 ± 10.82 ng/dL). Conclusion: Not only does IBD entail a high prevalence of osteoporosis, but BMD values are also indirectly affected by the fact that patient consumption of milk and other DPs decreases after diagnosis.",Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,0.6393340826034546

We herein investigated expressions of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), TGM2, PPARγ and isopeptide bonds, a reaction product of TGM, in non-CF nasal polyps. Methods: Nasal polyps and inferior turbinates were collected from chronic rhinosinusitis patients without CF during transnasal endoscopic sinonasal surgery. Expressions of CFTR, TGM2, isopeptide bonds and PPARγ were examined by fluorescence immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of CFTR was also analyzed by Western blot. Results: Immunohistochemical fluorescence of the nasal polyp was significantly lower for CFTR and PPARγ, and significantly higher for TGM2 and isopeptide bonds than that of the turbinate mucosa. Lower expression of CFTR in the nasal polyp than in the turbinate mucosa was also observed in Western blot. Expression of PPARG mRNA was significantly lower in the nasal polyp than in the turbinate mucosa, whereas expressions of CFTR mRNA or TGM2 mRNA did not differ between the two tissues. Immunohistochemical fluorescence for CFTR showed significant negative correlation with that for TGM2 and isopeptide bonds, and significant positive correlation with that for PPARγ. The fluorescence for TGM2 was positively correlated with that for isopeptide bonds and negatively correlated with that for PPARγ. The fluorescence for isopeptide bonds tended to be negatively correlated with that for PPARγ.

We compared the expressions of Cl<sup>-</sup> channels/transporters in nasal polyps with those in inferior turbinates to explore whether a deficiency in Cl<sup>-</sup> transport may participate in the pathophysiology of nasal polyp formation as in patients with cystic fibrosis. Methods: Nasal polyps and inferior turbinates were collected from 12 chronic rhinosinusitis patients with hypertrophic rhinitis and/or nasal polyps. Expressions of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), pendrin, Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), SLC26A3, TMEM16A and anion exchanger 2 (AE2) were examined by fluorescence immunohistochemistry using Alexa Fluor 488. Results: CFTR was weakly expressed on the epithelial surface of the turbinate mucosa whereas the nasal polyps showed almost no fluorescence. Pendrin was mainly expressed on the epithelial surface in both tissues. The fluorescence was moderate in the nasal polyps and strong in the turbinate mucosa. For NKCC1, moderate fluorescence was observed throughout the entire epithelial layer of the nasal polyps, but the turbinate mucosa exhibited almost no fluorescence. On the other hand, no fluorescence for SLC26A3, TMEM16A or AE2 was seen in either tissue. Conclusion: These results suggest that CFTR, pendrin and NKCC1 may participate in the pathogenesis of nasal mucosal edema and play roles in the mechanism of nasal polyp formation.",Does nasal polyp cause nasal block?,nasal polyp causes nasal block,1.0,Does nasal polyp cause nasal block?,0.9576044082641602

Elevated antibody levels have been associated with disease severity in nasal polyps, but upstream drivers of local antibody production in nasal polyps are undetermined. Objective: We sought to identify upstream drivers and phenotypic properties of local antibody-expressing cells in nasal polyps from subjects with AERD. Methods: Sinus tissue was obtained from subjects with AERD, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), CRS without nasal polyps, and controls without CRS. Tissue antibody levels were quantified via ELISA and immunohistochemistry and were correlated with disease severity. Antibody-expressing cells were profiled with single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence, with IL-5Rα function determined through IL-5 stimulation and subsequent RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR. Results: Tissue IgE and IgG4 levels were elevated in AERD compared with in controls (P .01 for IgE and P .001 for IgG4 vs CRSwNP). Subjects with AERD whose nasal polyps recurred rapidly had higher IgE levels than did subjects with AERD, with slower regrowth (P = .005). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed increased IL5RA, IGHG4, and IGHE in antibody-expressing cells from patients with AERD compared with antibody-expressing cells from patients with CRSwNP. There were more IL-5Rα<sup>+</sup> plasma cells in the polyp tissue from those with AERD than in polyp tissue from those with CRSwNP (P = .026). IL-5 stimulation of plasma cells in vitro induced changes in a distinct set of transcripts. Conclusions: Our study identifies an increase in antibody-expressing cells in AERD defined by transcript enrichment of IL5RA and IGHG4 or IGHE, with confirmed surface expression of IL-5Rα and functional IL-5 signaling. Tissue IgE and IgG4 levels are elevated in AERD, and higher IgE levels are associated with faster nasal polyp regrowth.

These organizations argue that the negative impact of such advertising outweighs the informational value claimed by the pharmaceutical industry. The industry maintains that further restrictions on DTCA are not warranted because it is successfully self-regulating via ""guiding principles"" for DTCA as certified by firm executives.

Methods: All consecutive patients presenting with aneurysmal disease with CIA ≥17 mm treated endovascularly from 2008 to 2016 were included. Patients were divided into two groups dependent upon the type of endovascular technique performed: bell bottom technique (BBT group), vs. other techniques (non-BBT group). Volumetric evolution of the CIA was assessed for each patient by computed tomography angiographic reconstructions performed pre-operatively, at six months, one year, and two years. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify risk factors for type 1b endoleak. Results: From 2008 to 2016, 74 patients with 110 CIA ≥17 mm were treated (BBT group: n = 58; non-BBT group: n = 52). Mean follow up was 48.1 months (median 39.0, IQR 38.1).

Hence, we investigated the anticancer effects of PES on U937 human leukemic cells. Firstly, PES significantly inhibited the proliferation of U937 cells in a dose-dependent manner. PES induced accumulation of the sub-G1 DNA content (apoptotic cell population), apoptotic bodies and chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation in the U937 cells. PES also induced activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9, subsequent cleavage of PARP, and significantly suppressed XIAP, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 in a dose-dependent manner.

The objective of this study was to uncover the diversity and population structure of 192 landraces from Ethiopia and Kenya together with four genepool control genotypes using morphological phenotyping and microsatellite marker genotyping. The germplasm represented different common bean production ecologies and seed types common in these countries. The landraces showed considerable diversity that corresponded well to the two recognized genepools (Andean and Mesoamerican) with little introgression between these groups. Mesoamerican genotypes were predominant in Ethiopia while Andean genotypes were predominant in Kenya. Within each country, landraces from different collection sites were clustered together indicating potential gene flow between regions within Kenya or within Ethiopia. Across countries, landraces from the same country of origin tended to cluster together indicating distinct germplasm at the national level and limited gene flow between the two countries highlighting divided social networks within the regions and a weak trans-national bean seed exchange especially for landrace varieties. One exception to this may be the case of small red-seeded beans where informal cross-border grain trade occurs. We also observed that genetic divergence was slightly higher for the Ethiopian landraces compared to Kenyan landraces and that Mesoamerican genotypes were more diverse than the Andean genotypes.

The effect of various weak acids and bases on SD formulations was also investigated herein. PVP/VA S-630 SD formulations in combination with weak acids and bases increased the apparent solubility of TDF. After 1h, the apparent solubility of PVP/VA S-630 SD formulations with MgO, meglumine, and tartaric acid were significantly higher by 387.0±4.17, 376.8±9.88, and 308.8±4.17μg/mL, respectively, than those of SD formulations without weak acids and bases (166.8±0.50μg/mL). The dissolution (%) of SD formulations with weak acids was under 60%; however, the dissolution (%) of those containing MgO, meglumine, and NaHCO 3 was over 80% in distilled water (specifically 85.6%, 89.9%, and 91.6%, respectively). The optimal SD formulation contained meglumine (B-2); both its apparent solubility after 24h and dissolution (%) were the highest among all SD formulations. The B-2 SD formulation showed no toxicity in Caco-2 cells after 24h. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC last ) and peak plasma concentration (C max ) of the orally administered B-2 SD formulation was greater than that with Cialis® powder in rats. We conclude that the B-2 SD formulation significantly improves the apparent solubility and dissolution (%) of TDF over that of commercially available products (i.e., Cialis®). Moreover, the B-2 SD formulation improves the relative bioavailability (BA) of TDF (21.9%) over that of Cialis®.",Does cialis treat enlarged prostrate?,cialis treats enlarged prostrate,1.0,Does cialis treat enlarged prostrate?,0.7598631381988525
12_h,health_belief,28450170,"The purpose of this study is to improve the solubility, in vitro dissolution, and oral bioavailability in rats of tadalafil (TDF) by using SD technique with a weak acid and a copolymer. TDF-SD was prepared via solvent evaporation, coupled with the incorporation of an acidifier and solubilizer. Tartaric acid enhanced the solubility of TDF over 5-fold in DW, and Soluplus<sup>®</sup> enhanced the solubility of TDF over 8.7-fold and 19.2-fold compared to that of TDF (pure) in DW and pH 1.2 for 1h, respectively. The optimal formulation of TDF-SD3 was composed of TDF vs Tartaric acid vs Soluplus<sup>®</sup> vs Aerosil=1:1:3:3. The in vitro dissolution rate of TDF-SD3 in DW, pH 1.2 and pH 6.8 buffer (51.5%, 53.3%, and 33.2%, respectively) was significantly higher than that of the commercial product (Cialis<sup>®</sup>) powder (16.5%, 15.2%, and 14.8%, respectively). TDF was completely transformed to an amorphous form as shown in SEM, DSC and PXRD data. The stability of TDF-SD3 included drug contents and in vitro dissolution for 1 month were similar to those of Cialis<sup>®</sup>, and the amorphous form of TDF-SD3 was well maintained for 6 months. The TDF-SD3 formulation improved the relative bioavailability (BA) and peak plasma concentration (C max ) compared to that of Cialis<sup>®</sup> powder after oral administration in rats as 117.3% and 135.7%, respectively. From the results, we found that the acidifier increased the wettability of TDF, and the solubilizer improved solubility through hydrogen bonding with TDF, thereby increasing the solubility, dissolution and oral bioavailability of TDF in TDF-SD3.",Does cialis treat enlarged prostrate?,cialis treats enlarged prostrate,1.0,Does cialis treat enlarged prostrate?,0.7875798940658569

Indeed, the quality of life in OI does not only depend on bones status, as OI might affect also other important functions. We have therefore implemented a multidisciplinary study to assess lung function, breathing pattern, sleep quality and nutritional status in 27 adult OI type III and IV patients (median age: 34.6 years; 19 women; 14 type III). Results: According to nocturnal oxygen desaturation, two groups were identified: 13 patients with (OI_OSA, incidence: 48.2%) and 14 without (no_OSA) obstructive sleep apnea. The former was characterized by higher spinal and ribcage deformity, by more restrictive lung function, by paradoxical thoracic breathing in supine position, by rapid and shallow breathing, by higher body mass index, by longer neck and waist circumferences; by higher abdominal volume and by greater percentage of body fat mass, particularly localized in the trunk. The best predictor of OI_OSA was the negative value of the supine ribcage contribution to tidal volume, followed by the ratio between the neck and the waist circumferences with body height and the supine thoraco-abdominal volumes phase shift angle. Conclusions: The pathophysiology of OI ensued a dangerous vicious circle, in which breathing, sleep and nutritional status are tightly linked, and they might all end up in negatively affecting the quality of life. The vicious circle is fed by some intrinsic characteristics of the disease (thoracic, cranial and mandibular deformities) and some bad daily habits of the patients (i.e. physical inactivity and low dietary quality). The former impacts on restricting the respiratory function, the latter makes Olers more prone to experience overweight or obesity. The main consequence is a high incidence of obstructive sleep apnea, which remains an underdiagnosed disorder in individuals with severe OI who are obese, with a neck to height ratio over than 31.6%, and characterized by paradoxical breathing in supine position. A multidisciplinary approach, including evaluations of breathing, sleep and nutrition, is required to better manage the disease and fulfil the maximizing well-being of OI patients.",Does diet cause bad breathe?,diet causes bad breathe,1.0,Does diet cause bad breathe?,0.6573508381843567

To our knowledge, there has never been an overfeeding study comparing the effects of multiple diets. Recent findings: This study reports a case study of an individual who ate 5800 Calories per day of 3 different diets for 21 days at a time. The 3 different diets were low-carb, low-fat, and very-low-fat vegan. The weight gain over 21 days was 1.3 kg for low-carb, 7.1 kg for low-fat, and 4.7 kg for very-low-fat vegan. Summary: In this n-of-1 study, consuming 5800 Calories/day of 3 different diets for 21 days did not lead to the same amount of weight gain.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of halitosis and its associated factors among students aged from 14 to 18 years in Kermanshah in 2015. Materials and methods: The study was conducted in high school students of Kermanshah city in 2015. The questionnaire including questions about bad breath and other associated factors (demographic information, background diseases, oral and dental problems, decay-missing-filled (DMF) index, etc.) was completed by students or determined by the examiner. Organoleptic evaluation was conducted. Prevalence of organoleptic and self-reported halitosis and related factors was reported. The relationship between malodor and variables was evaluated and the most important factor was determined by multiple logistic regression analysis. The diagnostic agreement between self-perception and organoleptic halitosis was assessed using Kappa coefficient as well. Results: The prevalence of halitosis in the organoleptic evaluation was 29.75% and higher in boys (32.6% male vs. 25.2% female) and 27.47% in self-perception (32.9% male vs. 19% female). The diagnostic agreement between organoleptic and self-perception halitosis was moderate or poor. Among the studied factors, the most important factor related to the organoleptic evaluation of halitosis was DMF≥4 (P 0.001 and OR=2.253). Conclusion: The DMF index was the factor most strongly associated with organoleptic halitosis in this sample of high school students. Other factors with significant association included parent's lower education level, not brushing, not flossing, bleeding gums, tongue coating, pericoronitis, and plaque index.

13_h,health_belief,30177382,"Aquatic areas frequently face hypoxic conditions. In order to get sufficient oxygen to support aerobic metabolism, a number of freshwater fish resort to aerial respiration to supplement gill respiration especially in situations with reduced oxygen availability in the water. In many species a concomitant reduction in gill surface area or in gill perfusion reduces possible loss of aerially acquired oxygen to the water at the gills, but it also compromises the ion regulatory capacity of gill tissue. In consequence, the reduced gill contact area with water requires appropriate compensation to maintain ion and acid-base homeostasis, often with important ramifications for other organs. Associated modifications in the structure and function of the gills themselves, the skin, the gut, the kidney, and the physiology of water exchange and ion-linked acid-base regulation are discussed. In air-breathing fish, the gut may gain particular importance for the uptake of ions. In addition, tissues frequently exposed to environmental air encounter much higher oxygen partial pressures than typically observed in fish tissues. Physostomous fish using the swimbladder for aerial respiration, for example, will encounter aerial oxygen partial pressure at the swimbladder epithelium when frequently gulping air in hypoxic water. Hyperoxic conditions or rapid changes in oxygen partial pressures result in an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accordingly, in air-breathing fish, strategies of ionoregulation may be greatly modified, and the ROS defense capacity of air-exposed tissues is improved.",Does diet cause bad breathe?,diet causes bad breathe,1.0,Does diet cause bad breathe?,0.3722436726093292

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the occurrence of halitosis among patients before and after a specific type of bariatric surgery, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and its relationship with the tongue coating index, plaque index, and salivary flow rate. Methods: A total of 62 patients with good oral health and in treatment for obesity at the walk-in clinic of Santa Casa Hospital, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, were selected. Of this sample, 31 were bariatric surgery candidates (control group) and 31 had already undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (case group). After completing a questionnaire, all patients underwent an oral clinical examination. Halitosis was measured using an organoleptic scale and a portable sulfide monitor. Results: The Spearman correlation demonstrated a strong positive relation between the organoleptic rates and the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds determined using the sulfide monitor (rs = .58; P = .0001). No difference was found in the prevalence of halitosis between the 2 groups (P = .48). Only the salivary flow rate was significantly reduced in the control group compared with the case group (P = .02). In the case group, the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds correlated negatively with the salivary flow rate (P = .04) and positively with the tongue coating index (P = .005). The tongue coating index was significantly increased in those patients who did not brush the tongue (P .04) and who had had episodes of vomiting (P = .02).

Although several epidemiological studies of NCD risk factors were conducted in Ethiopia, qualitative studies on people's dietary habit in relation to NCDs have not been conducted yet. This study aims to describe people's perception and practice of 'healthy' diet, and barriers to practice 'healthy' diet, paying attention to the dynamics between the perception and practice. We conducted 16 key informant interviews and eight focus group discussions in an urban and a rural areas in northern Ethiopia between November 2014 and January 2016. Audio-records in local language were transcribed word-for-word, and translated into English. English text data were analyzed qualitatively, through constant comparative analysis following the principles of the grounded theory. Three themes have emerged: (1) dietary habit perceived as 'good' or 'bad' for health; (2) reasons for continuing current 'unhealthy' dietary habit; and (3) current dietary habit perceived as 'traditional.' People's practice was mostly consistent with their perception, while they sometimes practiced contrary to the perception because of personal preference and physical or financial obstacles. People were often indifferent of health implications of their habitual dietary practice, such as drinking a lot of sweet coffee. We showed dynamics between perception and practice of 'healthy' diet among people in northern Ethiopia.

There is a common notion that young people feel they are immortal. Accordingly, we investigated whether young people would respond less to threats of death than to non-death threats and whether younger people would respond less to death threats than older people. This study was conducted with smokers in two age groups (16-25 and 40-50 years). Each respondent was exposed to one message about the threat of emphysema, either a death or non-death message. Younger smokers did not respond more to non-death threats than death threats and expressed a higher level of response to all threats than older smokers. It would appear that death threats are effective with young people and so we conclude that they do not feel immortal. An additional finding was that older females responded significantly more to non-death threats than older males. Death threats may not be effective with older females and a segmentation approach may be advisable when targeting older people using death threats in health promotion campaigns.",Does diet cause bad breathe?,diet causes bad breathe,1.0,Does diet cause bad breathe?,0.2897723317146301

However, pregnant women who get infected with Listeria may experience only mild symptoms, making the diagnosis difficult, even when the fetus is fatally infected. Methods: To reveal features of this infection, we conducted a multimodality imaging study of Listeria-induced miscarriage, using a pregnant mouse model. In this model, fetal morbidity and mortality can be observed in utero, noninvasively, and the timing and extent of infection can be carefully controlled. By employing in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI), perinatal infections were localized over time such that a correlation of infection to outcome could be determined without the need to kill the animal subject. The morbidity and viability of fetuses were assessed with ultrasound, and fetal morphology was imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: The ultrasound revealed sustained fetal bradycardia, the slowing of the fetal heartbeat, in infected fetuses, with an association between slowed fetal heart rate and strong bioluminescent signal. Discussion: Uninfected fetuses showing no bioluminescent signal in the same uterine horn exhibited normal heartbeats.

Infection during pregnancy can cause severe consequences especially for the fetus, leading to sepsis, premature delivery, stillbirth and miscarriage. Study design: A pilot observational study has been conducted in order to establish the prevalence of seroconversion of specific antibodies against a peculiar toxin belonging to L. monocytogenes, listeriolysin O (LLO), in a population of pregnant women from Senigallia (Central Italy) and to find correlations between anti-LLO antibodies seropositivity and health and nutritional information. A total of 60 women were screened for anti-LLO antibody positivity and interviewed during their pregnancies. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate antibody prevalence in serum samples and potential risk factors. Results: The seroprevalence resulted 18% (95% CI, 8.2 - 27.7%), corresponding to 11 pregnant women. Categorical principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis revealed a significant correlation between anti-LLO positivity and gastrointestinal pain events and vomit, fever and diarrhea episodes, and a possible association with consumption of pre-cooked meal. No significant correlation was observed in women with a previous miscarriage or with miscarriage cases in their families. Conclusions: Findings from this pilot study will be used to design a wider study focused on the prevalence of Listeria-specific antibodies in pregnant women and could allow to the identification of nutritional and behavioral habits related to Listeria infection which could lead to significant clinical implications.",Does listeria cause miscarriage?,listeria causes miscarriage,1.0,Does listeria cause miscarriage?,0.9972375631332397

The objective of this study was to detect the prevalence, serotypes, antimicrobial susceptibility and virulence factors of L. monocytogenes isolated from pregnant women with vaginitis at a tertiary care hospital in Tehran, Iran. Materials and methods: During September 2015 to February 2017, a total of 400 vaginal swabs were collected from pregnant women. The presumptive isolates were characterized biochemically. All L. monocytogenes isolates were further analyzed by serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility tests. All positive samples for L. monocytogenes were analyzed for presence of virulence genes ( hly A, act A, inl A, inl C, inl J and prf A). Results: Twenty-two (5.5%) of the samples were found positive for presence of L. monocytogenes. Most isolates are resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (81.82%) and chloramphenicol (54.55%). The majority of tested isolates (59.10%) belonged to serotype 4b, followed by 1/2a (22.73%), 1/2b (13.63%), and 3c (4.54%).
