1,2019,34444706,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Cranberry is a fruit originally from New England and currently growing throughout the east and northeast parts of the USA and Canada. The supplementation of cranberry extracts as nutraceuticals showed to contribute to the prevention of urinary tract infections, and most likely it may help to prevent cardiovascular and gastroenteric diseases, as highlighted by several clinical trials. However, aiming to validate the efficacy and safety of clinical applications as long-term randomized clinical trials (RCTs), further investigations of the mechanisms of action are required. In addition, a real challenge for next years is the standardization of cranberry's polyphenolic fractions. In this context, the optimization of the extraction process and downstream processing represent a key point for a reliable active principle for the formulation of a food supplement. For this reason, new non-conventional extraction methods have been developed to improve the quality of the extracts and reduce the overall costs. The aim of this survey is to describe both technologies and processes for highly active cranberry extracts as well as the effects observed in clinical studies and the respective tolerability notes.",0.9998656511306763
1,2019,33751068,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Background: Cranberry proanthocyanidins (c-PAC) are oligomeric structures of flavan-3-ol units, which possess A-type interflavan bonds. c-PAC differs from other botanical sources because other PAC mostly have B-type interflavan bonds. Cranberry products used to alleviate and prevent urinary tract infections may suffer from adulteration, where c-PAC are replaced with less expensive botanical sources of PAC that contain B-type interflavan bonds. Objective: Identifying the presence of A-type interflavan bonds in cranberry fruit and dietary supplements. Methods: Thirty-five samples reported to contain A-type PAC (cranberry fruit and cranberry products) and 36 samples reported to contain B-type PAC (other botanical sources) were identified and differentiated using MALDI-TOF MS, deconvolution of overlapping isotope patterns, and principal component analysis (PCA). Results: Our results show that both MALDI-TOF MS and deconvolution of overlapping isotope patterns were able to identify the presence of A-type interflavan bonds with a probability greater than 90% and a confidence of 95%. Deconvolution of MALDI-TOF MS spectra also determined the ratio of A-type to B-type interflavan bonds at each degree of polymerization in cranberry fruit and cranberry products, which is a distinguishing feature of c-PAC in comparison to other botanical sources of PAC. PCA shows clear differences based on the nature of the interflavan bonds. Conclusions: MALDI-TOF MS, deconvolution of overlapping isotope patterns of MALDI-TOF MS spectra, and PCA allow the identification, estimation, and differentiation of A-type interflavan bonds in cranberry-based foods and dietary supplements among other botanical sources containing mostly B-type interflavan bonds.",0.9995421171188354
1,2019,33215041,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Background: The recurrence of the urinary tract infections (UTI), following the antibiotic treatments suggests the pathogen's resistance to conventional antibiotics. This calls for the exploration of an alternative therapy. Main body: The anti-uropathogenic and bactericidal activity of many plant extracts was reported by many researchers, which involves only preliminary antibacterial studies using different basic techniques like disk diffusion, agar well diffusion, or minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the crude plant extracts, but reports on the specific action of the phytoconstituents against uropathogens are limited. Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton (cranberry) is the best-studied home remedy for UTI. Some evidences suggest that proanthocyanins present in cranberry, prevent bacteria from adhering to the walls of the urinary tract, subsequently blocking the further steps of uropathogenesis. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are beneficial microorganisms that may act by the competitive exclusion principle to defend against infections in the urogenital tracts. Reports on potential vaccine agents and antibodies targeting the different toxins and effecter proteins are still obscure except uropathogenic E. coli . Conclusion: This review highlights some of the medicinal herbs used by aborigines to prevent or treat acute or chronic urinary tract infections, botanicals with established urobactericidal activity, clinical trials undertaken to compare the efficacy of cranberry products in UTI prevention, and other natural therapeutics reported for UTI.",0.9995676875114441
1,2019,31862919,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by Escherichia coli create a large burden on healthcare and frequently lead to recurrent infections. Part of the success of E. coli as an uropathogenic bacterium can be attributed to its ability to form quiescent intracellular reservoirs in bladder cells and its persistence after antibiotic treatment. Cranberry juice and related products have been used for the prevention of UTIs with varying degrees of success. In this study, a group of cranberry pectic oligosaccharides (cPOS) were found to both inhibit quiescence and reduce the population of persister cells formed by the uropathogenic strain, CFT073. This is the first report detailing constituents of cranberry with the ability to modulate these important physiological aspects of uropathogenic E. coli. Further studies investigating cranberry should be keen to include oligosaccharides as part of the 'active' cocktail of chemical compounds.",0.9996724128723145
1,2019,31674202,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Objective: We assessed the effect on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) of a supplement containing cranberry, D-mannose and anti-inflammatory molecules in postmenopausal women undergoing surgery for cystocele. Study design: Forty postmenopausal women were randomized 1:1 to an active group receiving the nutritional supplement twice a day for 2 weeks starting from surgery, or to a control group receiving surgery only. Primary outcomes were the effectiveness in the postoperative LUTS and urinary tract infections (UTI). LUTS were investigated by a validated questionnaire (ICIQ-FLUTS) at baseline and at week 4. Secondary outcomes were the safety and tolerability of the supplement and other perioperative outcomes. Results: No significant differences were found in perioperative outcomes and in incidence of UTI. After surgery, women treated with the supplement experienced significantly better scores on the filling domain of the questionnaire. A non-significant decrease in voiding scores was also found. No adverse events were detected. Conclusion: The use of an oral supplement containing cranberry, D-mannose and anti-inflammatory molecules decreases the perception of LUTS in postmenopausal women after anterior colporraphy. Our data suggest that perioperative use of nutritional supplements may be useful in the management of postoperative LUTS.",0.2774560749530792
1,2019,31502331,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Aims: To investigate the efficiency of triclosan, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and cranberry alone or in combinations against Escherichia coli strains as urinary catheter lock solutions to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Methods and results: Viable counting was used to assess antibiofilm activities for triclosan, EDTA and cranberry alone or in combinations against E. coli strains embedded in biofilm onto all-silicon Foley catheter surface. The results revealed that combination of triclosan (10 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> /EDTA 30 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> ) when filling the catheter balloon was able to eradicate and prevent biofilm formation among all tested E. coli including the resistant strains, whereas triclosan (8·5 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> )/ cranberry (103 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> ) combination was a successful catheter lock solution by preventing all tested strains from adhering onto catheter surface when filled via the eye hole. Conclusions: The combinations of triclosan/EDTA and triclosan/cranberry were significantly effective in eradicating and preventing biofilm formation of the tested E. coli strains on Foley catheters. Significance and impact of the study: Combinations of triclosan/EDTA and triclosan/cranberry have a promising application as nonantibiotic catheter lock solution.",0.9993822574615479
1,2019,31227473,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Objective: This article provides a comprehensive literature review on nonantibiotic agents used for the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women ≥45 years of age. Design: A structured review was performed by conducting a literature search to identify relevant studies pertaining to the use of nonantibiotic agents to prevent UTIs in women who were perimenopausal through postmenopausal. Recommendations were made for or against the use of each nonantibiotic agent, unless data were unavailable. Levels of evidence were assigned to each recommendation made. Setting and participants: Studies on the prevention of UTIs with women subjects ≥45 years of age in the community, inpatient, and long-term care settings were considered for inclusion. Measure: The efficacy and safety of using ascorbic acid, cranberry products, d-mannose, estrogens, lactobacilli, and methenamine hippurate for prevention of UTIs was assessed. Results: There is evidence to support use of estrogens (A-I) in postmenopausal women, and cranberry capsules (C-I) in women ≥45 years of age for the prevention of UTIs. There was a lack of evidence to make recommendations for or against the use of ascorbic acid, cranberry juice, cranberry capsules with high proanthocyanidin (PAC) content, d-mannose, lactobacillus, and methenamine hippurate in this population. Conclusions/implications: Current studies support that estrogens and cranberry capsules may have a role in preventing UTIs in women ≥45 years of age. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of these nonantibiotic agents and how they may be used to decrease antibiotic use.",0.9997249245643616
1,2019,30873836,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Cranberry ( Vaccinium macrocarpon) juice is traditionally used for the prevention of urinary tract infections. Human urine produced after cranberry juice consumption can prevent Escherichia coli adhesion, but the antiadhesive urinary metabolites responsible have not been conclusively identified. Adult female sows were therefore fed spray-dried cranberry powder (5 g/kg/day), and urine was collected via catheter. Urine fractions were tested for antiadhesion activity using a human red blood cell (A+) anti-hemagglutination assay with uropathogenic P-fimbriated E. coli. Components were isolated from fractions of interest using Sephadex LH-20 gel filtration chromatography followed by HPLC on normal and reversed-phase sorbents with evaporative light scattering detection. Active urine fractions were found to contain a complex series of oligosaccharides but not proanthocyanidins, and a single representative arabinoxyloglucan octasaccharide was isolated in sufficient quantity and purity for full structural characterization by chemical derivatization and NMR spectroscopic methods. Analogous cranberry material contained a similar complex series of arabinoxyloglucan oligosaccharides that exhibited antiadhesion properties in preliminary testing. These results indicate that oligosaccharides structurally related to those found in cranberry may contribute to the antiadhesion properties of urine after cranberry consumption.",0.9998352527618408
1,2019,30798908,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Urinary tract infections are among the most common infectious diseases worldwide, primarily caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains that harbor type I pili and P pili on the surface. Standard E. coli therapy still entails antibiotic consumption, but urinary tract infections tend to recur at a very high rate. Due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of UPEC, as well as high infection recurrence rates, there is a need for new approaches to efficiently treat and prevent urinary tract infections. Since aforementioned adhesive organelles are the principal virulence factors in UPEC, anti-adhesion strategy seems to be the most promising (and hitherto unexplored) treatment option. Here we propose an antiadhesive dual targeting approach towards FimH and PapG adhesive proteins placed on two key virulence factors for UPEC - type I fimbriae and P pili. Such dual antagonists will contain appropriate pharmacophores (mannose and natural cranberry-containing polyphenol) joined together and will more efficiently block the infection and prevent the progression of the disease in comparison to FimH and PapG as isolated targets. More specifically, polyphenol mannosides (due to the structural similarities with the most potent biaryl inhibitors) can act as high-affinity FimH ligands, while cranberry-associated polyphenol moiety can additionally inhibit the PapG-mediated adhesion. Proposed compound may also contribute to the antioxidant capacity of the human organism. In conclusion, this dual-target hypothesis for the prevention and treatment of UPEC infections represents an important foundation for further research on this topic.",0.9972372055053711
1,2019,30520372,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent a common and costly public health issue. The bacterium Escherichia coli is mainly responsible for most uncomplicated UTIs. Cranberry antibacterial effects have extensively been studied in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of action of its bioactive components and their clinical benefits against UTIs. In this respect, the present review aims to critically analyze the current clinical studies that have evaluated the efficacy of supplementing cranberry products against UTIs in different subpopulations. Methods: PubMed database was comprehensively searched, using relative keywords in order to identify clinical trials exploring the efficacy of cranberry supplementation against UTIs. Results: Current clinical evidence clearly indicates a possible benefit overall from the use of cranberries against UTIs. Cranberry consumption may prevent bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells, reducing UTI related symptoms. Cranberry consumption could also decrease UTI related symptoms by suppressing inflammatory cascades as an immunologic response to bacterial invasion. The existing clinical trials have supported substantial evidence that the beneficial effects of cranberry against UTIs seem to be prophylactic by preventing infections recurrence; however, they exert low effectiveness in populations at increased risk for contracting UTIs. Moreover, a lack of cost-effectiveness for cranberry supplementation has been highlighted. Conclusions: Additional well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials that use standardized cranberry products for long study periods are strongly recommended in order to determine the efficiency of cranberry on the prevention of UTIs in susceptible populations. At present, cranberry supplementation can safely be suggested as complementary therapy in women with recurrent UTIs.",0.9997524619102478
3,2019,34889516,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder that causes dementia and affects millions of people worldwide. Although it has devastating outcomes for patients and tremendous economic costs to society, there is currently no effective treatment available. Aims: The high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) is an established treatment for refractory epilepsy with a proven efficacy. Although the considerable interest has emerged in recent years for applying KD in AD patients, only few interventional studies in animals and humans have addressed the effects of KD on cognitive impairments, and the results were inconclusive. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of KD on cognitive functions and AD pathology in 5XFAD mice-a validated animal model of AD. Results: Four months of a ketogenic diet improved spatial learning, spatial memory and working memory in 5XFAD mice. The improvement in cognitive functions was associated with a restored number of neurons and synapses in both the hippocampus and the cortex. Ketogenic diet treatment also reduced amyloid plaque deposition and microglial activation, resulting in reduced neuroinflammation. The positive effect of ketogenic diet on cognitive functions depended on the starting time and the duration of the diet. A shorter period (2 months) of ketogenic diet treatment had a weaker effect. Ketogenic diet initiated at late stage of AD (9 months of age) displayed no effect on cognitive improvement. Conclusions: These findings indicate positive effects of ketogenic diet on both cognitive function and histopathology in Alzheimer's disease, which could be due to reduced microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Our findings provide new insights and therapeutic interventions for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",0.013401717878878117
3,2019,32759074,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"Objective: The aim of this pilot study was to examine the safety and tolerability of an eight-week treatment of twice weekly auricular acupuncture as a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). The secondary aim was to determine if auricular acupuncture was effective at reducing PNES event frequency. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are as common as multiple sclerosis and are highly resistant to intervention. Unfortunately, there is no standard of care therapy, although mental health treatment referrals are commonly made. Acupuncture is felt to be a safe and cost-effective treatment for many diseases and symptoms including mental health disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and conversion disorders. We propose to examine auricular acupuncture as a treatment for PNES. Methods: A single-center, 16-week trial of auricular acupuncture was designed: a four-week baseline period, followed by an eight-week active treatment period during which subjects received twice weekly auricular acupuncture, then followed by a four-week washout period. Tolerability was defined as completion of 12 of 16 treatments. Successful compliance with seizure diary was defined as &gt;80%, or 100 of 120 days completed. Safety profile was established and seizure count per week was also calculated. Results: A total of 29 subjects enrolled from a consecutive sample of 73 PNES diagnoses discharging from our epilepsy unit. Twenty-two subjects entered the study with 91% completing more than 12 of 16 treatments, 91% meeting the endpoint of completing &gt;80% of diary entries. Adverse events were mild, and only two subjects were withdrawn due to increased PNES frequency. Although short-term in design, using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), we observed a statistically significant reduction in seizure count from baseline at treatment month one, treatment month two, and at the washout period (p = 0.0083). Eleven of 12 subjects (52.3%) who received at least one treatment recorded a 50% frequency reduction. Three of 21 subjects (14%) were PNES-free at the end of the study. Significance: Auricular acupuncture is well-tolerated in a population with PNES and exhibits similar event frequency reductions as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We believe that this is the first literature report examining auricular acupuncture for the treatment of PNES.",0.9997178912162781
3,2019,30467307,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of treatment with transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) for patients with refractory epilepsy by evaluation of the frequency of seizures, electroencephalogram (EEG) changes, and quality of life on follow-up at three months and six months. MATERIAL AND METHODS EEG evaluation followed baseline evaluation with EEG at three months and six months following tVNS treatment. The frequency of seizures was recorded during the six-month study period. Before and after tVNS treatment, patients completed the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), the Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale (LSSS), the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31), and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS Seventeen patients completed six months of tVNS treatment. Following three months of tVNS therapy, the frequency of epileptic seizures decreased in 13/17 subjects, with an average reduced seizure rate of 31.3%. Following six months of tVNS treatment, the frequency of epileptic seizures decreased in 16/17 subjects, with an average reduced seizure rate of 64.4%. There were 14/17 cases with abnormal EEG at baseline; 2/17 patients had improved EEGs by three months, and 10/17 patients had improved EEGs by six months. During the study period, there were no adverse events associated with tVNS treatment, but the effects on sleep were inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary study showed that tVNS was an effective and safe adjuvant treatment for refractory epilepsy that reduced seizure frequency and reduced abnormal EEG changes following clinical improvement.",0.9993672966957092
3,2019,29231410,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"Objective: To analyze the effects of motor function of cerebral palsy children by the adjuvant therapy of acupuncture and its factors retrospectively. Methods: Five hundred and twenty cerebral palsy children in hospital (from January 2005 to December 2014) who meet the criteria were selected through Doctor Workstation of our hospital. The cases were divided into groups according to the type of cerebral palsy, gestational age, complication, treatment time and age. Based on the physical rehabilitation, all the patients were assisted by acupuncture. Scalp acupuncture was used at Zhiqizhen (seven-intelligent needles), motor area, foot-motor-sensory area, etc. Body acupuncture were mainly at the governor vessel and yangming meridians of hand and foot. Treatment was given once every other day for eight months. Effects were evaluated by gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) and gross motor function measure (GMFM). Results: ① GMFCS:after eight-month treatment, the total effective rate of children with spastic cerebral palsy was superior to those of mixed type and involuntary movement type[77.9% (300/385) vs 60.3% (38/63), 56.9% (41/72), both P 0.01]. The total effective rates of the above three types with gestational age from 37 to 42 weeks were better than those of the corresponding types with gestational age ( P 0.01, P 0.05). The efficacy of children with mental retardation and language disorderwas higher than that of epilepsy and hearing disorder ( P 0.01, P 0.05). The total effective rates of patients in the three types with the age of 1-2 were better than those of the corresponding types with the age of 2-4 (all P 0.05). ② GMFM:after three-month and eight-month treatment, the GMFM scores of the three types were increased in different degrees (all P 0.01), and after eight-month treatment, the score of the spastic type was increased more obviously than those of the other two types (both P 0.01). Conclusions: The motor function of cerebral palsy children can be improved assisted by acupuncture, and the effect may be related to treating time, cerebral palsy type, gestational age, complication and age.",0.00032364745857194066
3,2019,26355236,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"Background: Approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy remain refractory to drug treatment and continue to experience seizures whilst taking one or more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Several non-pharmacological interventions that may be used in conjunction with or as an alternative to AEDs are available for refractory patients. In view of the fact that seizures in people with intellectual disabilities are often complex and refractory to pharmacological interventions, it is evident that good quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to assess the efficacy of alternatives or adjuncts to pharmacological interventions.This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review (Beavis 2007) published in The Cochrane Library (2007, Issue 4). Objectives: To assess data derived from randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities.Non-pharmacological interventions include, but are not limited to, the following.• Surgical procedures.• Specialised diets, for example, the ketogenic diet, or vitamin and folic acid supplementation.• Psychological interventions for patients or for patients and carers/parents, for example, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), electroencephalographic (EEG) biofeedback and educational intervention.• Yoga.• Acupuncture.• Relaxation therapy (e.g. music therapy). Search methods: For the latest update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (19 August 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via CRSO (19 August 2014), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 19 August 2014) and PsycINFO (EBSCOhost, 1887 to 19 August 2014). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted study data. Main results: One study is included in this review. When two surgical procedures were compared, results indicated that corpus callosotomy with anterior temporal lobectomy was more effective than anterior temporal lobectomy alone in improving quality of life and performance on IQ tests among people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. No evidence was found to support superior benefit in seizure control for either intervention. This is the only study of its kind and was rated as having an overall unclear risk of bias. The previous update (December 2010) identified one RCT in progress. The study authors have confirmed that they are aiming to publish by the end of 2015; therefore this study (Bjurulf 2008) has not been included in the current review. Authors' conclusions: This review highlights the need for well-designed randomised controlled trials conducted to assess the effects of non-pharmacological interventions on seizure and behavioural outcomes in people with intellectual disabilities and epilepsy.",0.9998155236244202
3,2019,25950453,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"In recent years, acupuncture has increasingly being integrated into pediatric health care. It was used on ~150,000 children (0.2%). We aim to update the evidence for the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for children and evaluate the methodological qualities of these studies to improve future research in this area. We included 24 systematic reviews, comprising 142 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 12,787 participants. Only 25% (6/24) reviews were considered to be high quality (10.00 ± 0.63). High-quality systematic reviews and Cochrane systematic reviews tend to yield neutral or negative results (P = 0.052, 0.009 respectively). The efficacy of acupuncture for five diseases (Cerebral Palsy (CP), nocturnal enuresis, tic disorders, amblyopia, and pain reduction) is promising. It was unclear for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mumps, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), asthma, nausea/vomiting, and myopia. Acupuncture is not effective for epilepsy. Only six reviews reported adverse events (AEs) and no fatal side effects were reported. The efficacy of acupuncture for some diseases is promising and there have been no fatal side effects reported. Further high-quality studies are justified, with five diseases in particular as research priorities.",0.0002516458334866911

Acupuncture is also used to treat epilepsy. This study was designed to examine the safety and effectiveness of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (ta-VNS) for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Methods: A total of 50 volunteer patients with drug-resistant epilepsy were selected for a random clinical trial to observe the therapeutic effect of ta-VNS. The seizure frequency, quality of life, and severity were assessed in weeks 8, 16, and 24 of the treatment according to the percentage of seizure frequency reduction. Results: In the pilot study, 47 of the 50 epilepsy patients completed the 24-week treatment; three dropped off. After 8-week treatment, six of the 47 patients (12%) were seizure free and 12 (24%) had a reduction in seizure frequency. In week 16 of the continuous treatment, six of the 47 patients (12%) were seizure free; 17 (34%) had a reduction in seizure frequency. After 24 weeks' treatment, eight patients (16%) were seizure free; 19 (38%) had reduced seizure frequency. Conclusion: Similar to the therapeutic effect of VNS, ta-VNS can suppress epileptic seizures and is a safe, effective, economical, and widely applicable treatment option for drug-resistant epilepsy.

5,2019,34671239,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,"Background: Menstrual migraine without aura (MMoA) refers to a specific type of migraine that is associated with the female ovarian cycle. It is particularly serious and has brought huge life pressure and mental burden to female patients. Acupuncture has been commonly used to prevent migraines and relieve concomitant emotional disorders; however, the physiological mechanism underlying this intervention remains unclear. This study aimed to use resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to investigate whether acupuncture can modulate brain function and if the potential influence on brain activity correlates with improving emotional symptoms in MMoA patients. Methods: Overall, 44 patients were randomly divided into a true acupuncture (TA) group and the sham acupuncture (SA) group. Patients underwent rsfMRI before and after 3-month treatment, the amplitude of low-frequency fuctuations (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) in rsfMRI were calculated. Zung self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS), frequency of migraine attacks, visual analog scale, and intensity of the migraine were used for evaluate the clinical effect. The clinical changes of variables were also used to further assess the correlation with brain activity in MMoA patients. Results: After acupuncture treatment, the emotional symptoms of both groups of patients improved, and the clinical symptoms of migraine were alleviated. The major finding of our study was that patients with MMoA showed lower ALFF value in the left anterior cingulate and the value was positively correlated with the decreases in the SAS and SDS scores. In the SA group, common brain regions responded both in ALFF and regional homogeneity values mainly in the insula, and no significant correlations were observed between brain regions and clinical variables. Conclusions: These results indicated that both two acupuncture treatments were helpful in treating migraine and could improve emotion symptoms. TA had a relatively better effect in reducing the frequency of migraine attack than SA. The two therapies have different modulation effects as TA regulates emotional disorders by modulating the frontal-limbic regions, and SA may modulate pain perception through the placebo effect on insula and by indirectly regulating emotional disorders. These findings provided evidence that acupuncture is a complementary and alternative therapy to relieve clinical symptoms in female patients with migraines and could help enhance clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Many risk factors for severe COVID-19-older age, male gender, cardiac and respiratory diseases, diabetes, obesity, and immunosuppression-are less frequent in migraineurs. Telemedicine is effective for migraine follow-up, and needs ongoing evaluation. Most migraine treatments can start or continue in acute COVID-19, with care to avoid drug interactions. Close contact procedures (botulinum toxin, acupuncture and steroid injections) are avoided in lockdown or in the vulnerable. Secondary effects of COVID-19, including long COVID and its economic impact, are probably equal or greater in people with migraine.

Although the advance in treatment for migraine, some patients prefer CAM therapies due to their concerns about conventional therapies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between CAM use and chronicity of migraine among Turkish migraineurs. Methods: Consecutive episodic and chronic migraine patients were recruited. A questionnaire of a list of CAM modalities including traditional therapies specific to Turkish culture, which was constructed by researcher through a literature review was given to all participants. Patterns of CAM treatments and patients' reluctance to share CAM use with their doctors were evaluated. Results: Sixty-nine patients with episodic migraine and 31 with chronic migraine enrolled in the study. Thirty-six patients reported that they had tried CAM at least once within the last year. Massage, exercise, acupuncture, holistic methods, herbalism, vitamins, psychotherapy, hypnose, cupping, and neural therapy were used. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were not differed in CAM users of both groups. Eighty-one per cent of CAM users stated that they preferred not to tell their doctors about their CAM use if not asked. Conclusions: Patterns of CAM use in Turkey for migraine differ from western practices. Due to fear of disapproval, patients tend to hide CAM use from their doctors.

5,2019,27663925,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,"Dear Editor, the practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine described psoriasis some 2000 years ago (1). Psoriasis vulgaris is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease whose worldwide prevalence ranges from 0.1-3% (2,3). Understanding the role of the immune system in psoriasis and the interplay between the innate and adaptive immune system has helped to manage this complex disease, which affects patients far beyond the skin changes themselves (2). In addition to the usual and widely accepted methods of treatment of psoriasis, including topical therapies, phototherapy, and conventional and biological systemic therapies, data can be found in the literature that suggest a favorable effect of acupuncture on the course of psoriasis (4,5). Despite that, this complementary method of traditional treatment of various diseases is not yet widely accepted worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), acupuncture has been an officially recognized method of treatment for more than 50 diseases from 1979 (5). At the Department of Neurology at the University Hospital Center Zagreb, acupuncture has been used since 2011 for the treatment of various types of headaches, trigeminal neuralgia, and spinal pain syndromes. We report the case of a patient with a known history of psoriasis who was treated for chronic migraines with acupuncture. The 49-year-old female patient was examined for headache of a pulsating character that she had had for 16 years. The headache was mainly located on the left side of head and accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and both photophobia and phonophobia, and there was a worsening of symptoms upon exertion. The headaches were occurring once a week with an average duration of 2-3 continuous days. The patient also had frequent mild headaches. Additionally, the patient was diagnosed with psoriasis at the age of 29 and was occasionally treated with phototherapy. Systemic therapy for psoriasis had not been given to the patient thus far. After the clinical evaluation and considering the medical history and clinical findings, the diagnosis of chronic migraine was established and prophylactic therapy with dual antidepressant was introduced. On follow-up examinations, a reduction in the frequency and intensity of migraine headaches was observed. After one year there was a progression of symptoms, and treatments with acupuncture were started. Stainless steel filiform needles of 25 mm in length were inserted perpendicularly into points on the head, arm, and legs and retained for 30 minutes. The treatment was administered once a day for 10 days with an interval of 2-3 days between treatments. The patient showed significant improvement for a period of 6 months after the acupuncture treatment, which is why the treatment with acupuncture was repeated. The patient stated that very soon after the beginning of each acupuncture treatment, she had noticed a significant improvement regarding psoriatic lesions as a ""side effect"". On the first day of acupuncture, extensive erythematosquamous plaques were noticed on the skin of the dorsum of the feet (Figure 1), palms, and elbows. It is important to emphasize that the patient did not use any specific topical antipsoriatic therapies during the acupuncture treatment, but only bland emollients. During the third week of treatment, a significant improvement was observed, or according to the patient, ""she has not had such a good skin for a long time"" (Figure 2). The improvement of the clinical status can be explained by overlapping acupuncture points used in the treatment of pain syndromes and psoriasis or to the holistic effect of acupuncture. In recent years, several high-quality evidence-based Western medicine guidelines have been developed for the treatment of psoriasis (6,7). In addition to that modern approach, several studies confirmed the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of psoriasis. The recent review by Coyle et al. (4) indicates promising evidence of the efficacy of acupuncture for psoriasis treatment with an increasing number of people achieving clinical and statistical improvements. Furthermore, Wang et al. (8) have recently published the protocol for a systematic review which aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for patients with psoriasis. In acupuncture, hair-thin needles are inserted into the skin, releasing natural pain killers such as adenosine, endorphins, and serotonin into the body. It is known that patients with psoriatic arthritis can benefit from the treatment. Some patients may be concerned that acupuncture needles could worsen a skin flare-up but an acupuncturist uses sterile needles to prevent any risk to flaring skin. The advantage of acupuncture is that it is a very safe alternative medicine treatment and is not likely to interfere with any existing psoriasis treatment. It is important to note that acupuncture is a 5000-year-old alternative medicine treatment and that it has been officially recognized by the WHO for more than three decades (5). After achieving clinical improvement and regression of psoriatic plaques during the acupuncture for headache, the authors reviewed the literature and found reports about possible benefits of treating psoriasis with acupuncture. Therefore, the purpose of this letter and case study is to raise awareness and inform dermatologists about the different and until now under-explored possibilities of acupuncture in treating psoriasis.",0.9992473125457764

Prophylactic drugs are used to prevent migraine headaches but are unpromising. Objective: To assess the effects of adding acupuncture to conventional migraine prophylaxis. Methods: One hundred patients with migraine (41 male, 59 female), in whom prophylactic drugs had not produced a fall of at least 50% in the number of attacks, entered the study. The patients were randomised into two groups, sham and true acupuncture. The patients in both groups continued their prophylactic treatment and received 12 sessions of either true or sham acupuncture. Each session was 30 min and was repeated three times a week. The number of headaches in the two groups was compared at baseline, and at the end of four successive months. Results: There was no significant difference in the frequency of attacks between the two groups before intervention. After 1 month, the frequency of attacks each month decreased from 5.1 (0.8) to 3.4 (1.2) in the true acupuncture group, and from 5.0 (0.8) to 4.4 (1.1) in the sham acupuncture group (a significant difference, p 0.001). The frequency continued to decrease in month 2 but increased in months 3 and 4; however, it was still significantly lower than baseline, and the difference remained significant after month 4.

Objectives: Which diseases are in particular relevant regarding pain therapy?What is the social-medical care situation regarding pain facilities in Germany?What is the social-medical care situation in pain therapy when comparing on international level?Which effects, costs or cost-effects can be seen on the micro-, meso- and macro level with regard to pain therapy?Among which social-medical services in pain therapy is there is an over- or undertreatment with regard to the micro-, meso- and macro level?Which medical and organisational aspects that have an effect on the costs and/or cost-effectiveness have to be particularly taken into account with regard to pain treatment/chronic pain?What is the influence of the individual patient's needs (micro level) in different situations of pain (e. g. palliative situation) on the meso- and macro level?Which social-medical and ethical aspects for an adequate treatment of chronic pain on each level have to be specially taken into account?Is the consideration of these aspects appropriate to avoid over- or undertreatment?Are juridical questions included in every day care of chronic pain patients, mainly in palliative care?On which level can appropriate interventions prevent over- or undertreatment? Methods: A systematic literature research is done in 35 databases. In the HTA, reviews, epidemiological and clinical studies and economic evaluations are included which report about pain therapy and in particular palliative care in the years 2005 till 2010. Results: 47 studies meet the inclusion criteria. An undertreatment of acupuncture, over- and misuse with regard to opiate prescription and an overuse regarding unspecific chest pain and chronic low back pain (LBP) can be observed. The results show the benefit and the cost-effectiveness of interdisciplinary as well as multi-professional approaches, multimodal pain therapy and cross-sectoral integrated medical care. Only rough values can be determined about the care situation regarding the supply of pain therapeutic and palliative medical facilities as the data are completely insufficient. Discussion: Due to the broad research question the HTA-report contains inevitably different outcomes and study designs which partially differ qualitatively very strong from each other. In the field of palliative care hospices for in-patients and palliative wards as well as hospices for out-patients are becoming more and more important. Palliative care is a basic right of all terminally ill persons. Conclusion: Despite the relatively high number of studies in Germany the HTA-report shows a massive lack in health care research. Based on the studies a further expansion of out-patient pain and palliative care is recommended. Further training for all involved professional groups must be improved. An independent empirical analysis is necessary to determine over or undertreatment in pain care.",0.9979052543640137

Among vitamins and other supplements, riboflavin and coenzyme Q10 significantly decreased the frequency of migraine attacks. Alpha lipoic acid also reduced migraine frequency, albeit not significantly as compared to placebo. The prophylactic efficacy of magnesium, particularly for children and menstrually related migraine, has recently been substantiated. Among the herbal remedies, butterbur significantly decreases attack frequency, whereas the efficacy of feverfew was not confirmed in a Cochrane review, probably because of the 400% variations in the dosage of its active principle.

These plants biosynthesize amygdalin in defense against herbivore animals, as amygdalin generates poisonous cyanide upon plant tissue destruction.<sup>1-4</sup> Poisonous to many animals, amygdalin-derived cyanide is detoxified by potent enzymes commonly found in bacteria and plants but not most animals.<sup>5</sup> Here we show that the nematode C. elegans can detoxify amygdalin by a genetic pathway comprising cysl-1, egl-9, hif-1, and cysl-2. A screen of a natural product library for hypoxia-independent regulators of HIF-1 identifies amygdalin as a potent activator of cysl-2, a HIF-1 transcriptional target that encodes a cyanide detoxification enzyme in C. elegans. As a cysl-2 paralog similarly essential for amygdalin resistance, cysl-1 encodes a protein homologous to cysteine biosynthetic enzymes in bacteria and plants but functionally co-opted in C. elegans. We identify exclusively HIF-activating egl-9 mutations in a cysl-1 suppressor screen and show that cysl-1 confers amygdalin resistance by regulating HIF-1-dependent cysl-2 transcription to protect against amygdalin toxicity. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that cysl-1 and cysl-2 were likely acquired from green algae through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and functionally co-opted in protection against amygdalin. Since acquisition, these two genes evolved division of labor in a cellular circuit to detect and detoxify cyanide.

Even though the anti-cancer properties of amygdalin are well known, its effect on normal cells has not been thoroughly investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible chemo-protective role of amygdalin against the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy for normal human cells. Specifically, it was tested in combination with a strong chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. Human non-tumorigenic MCF12F epithelial cell line, human fibroblasts cells, human breast cancer MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with cisplatin in a dose- and time-depended manner in the absence or presence of amygdalin. When MCF12F cells and fibroblasts underwent pre-treatment with amygdalin followed by cisplatin treatment (24 h amygdalin + 24 h cisplatin), the cell viability was increased (22%, p 0.001) as indicated using MTT assay. As attested by flow cytometry, combination treatment was associated with decreased the percentage of late apoptotic cells compared with monotherapy (fold-change of decrease = 1.6 and 4.5 for 15 and 20 μΜ, respectively). Also, the proteins expression of PUMA, p53, phospho-p53 and Bax decreased, when a combination treatment was used vs. cisplatin alone, while the proapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL exhibited an increased tendency in the presence of amygdalin. Moreover, the levels of pro-apoptotic genes PUMA , p53 , and BAX mRNA were significantly downregulated (∼83%, ∼66%, and ∼44%, respectively) vs. cisplatin alone, while the mRNA levels of anti-apoptotic genes BCl-2 and Bcl-XL were upregulated (∼44.5% and ∼51%, respectively), vs. cisplatin alone after 24 h of combination treatment. The study on the Combination index (CI) assay indicated that amygdalin could be possibly considered as an antagonist to cisplatin (2.2 and 2.3) for MCF12F and fibroblast cells, respectively. In contrast, for the breast cancer MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, amygdalin and cisplatin indicated a synergistic effect (0.8 and 0.65), respectively.

Amygdalin is reported to attenuate external stimuli-induced cardiovascular diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not understood. In this study, we aim to explore the protective effects of amygdalin on PM2.5-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) injury and unravel the specific mechanisms by MTT, DCFH-DA, biochemical, immunofluorescence, ELISA, RT-qPCR, flow cytometry, TUNEL and western blot analysis. The results reveal that amygdalin reverses PM2.5-induced cytotoxicity and attenuates intracellular ROS production. Moreover, amygdalin increases the levels of SOD and GSH and alleviates the MDA content. Additionally, amygdalin causes a decline of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and COX-2 levels. Moreover, amygdalin inhibits NF-κB p50 and TLR4 protein expressions and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. Concomitantly, a decline of phospho-NF-κB p65/NF-κB p65 and phospho-IκB-α/IκB-α is detected. Meanwhile, amygdalin pretreatment reduces HUVEC apoptosis. In addition, amygdalin triggers an upregulation of Bcl-2 and a downregulation of Bax after stimulation with PM2.5. Collectively, these results suggest that amygdalin suppresses PM2.5-induced HUVEC injury by regulating the TLR4/NF-κB and Bcl-2/Bax signaling pathways, indicating that amygdalin may be a novel target for atherosclerosis treatments.",0.001525935367681086

Purpose: This study aims to explore whether glycosides are the main effective components of BYHWD in anti-atherosclerotic inflammation and whether their mechanism is related to the classical JAK/STAT inflammatory signaling pathway. Methods: UPLC-MSMS method was used to determine the main components of BYHWD and its glycosides. Network pharmacological analysis and molecular docking were used to predict the potential therapeutic targets of glycosides. Atherosclerosis model was prepared by feeding HFD in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The effects of glycosides on atherosclerosis were detected by blood lipids measurement, Masson staining, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, western-blot and droplet digital PCR. RAW264.7 cells were used to establish foam cells model. The mechanism of glycosides anti-atherosclerotic inflammation was detected by measuring intracellular lipids, Oil Red O staining, ELISA, western-blot and droplet digital PCR. Results: 1. Glycosides were absorbed into the blood through oral administrations and existed in the blood in the form of glycosides structures. 2. Glycosides attenuated hyperlipidemia, alleviated atherosclerotic lesions and inhibited inflammatory reaction. They could regulate blood lipids by decreasing TC, TG, LDL-c, increasing HDL-c level in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice, alleviating intimal area and thickness, and inhibiting atherosclerotic plaque formation, which were similar to BYHWD. 3.

The goal of the present study was to investigate the amygdalin degradation potential and genome profile of the native microbes found in maesil syrup. The microbial profile analysis revealed that yeast is the predominant microorganism native to maesil syrup and that the isolated yeast cells showed a remarkable potential for amygdalin reduction (99.7%). Moreover, the reduction in amygdalin was inversely proportional to the growth of the isolated yeast. The whole-genome analysis revealed that the isolated yeast is Zygosaccharomyces rouxii (genome size 10 Mb, 39.25% of GC content). Of the 5250 genes (64.88%) predicted in the Z. rouxii genome, 5245 (99.90%) were annotated using NCBI Non-Redundant, UniProt, and InterProScan databases. The genome of the isolated Z. ruoxii harbored 2.03% of repeats and 0.68% of non-coding RNAs. Protein prediction indicated that β-glycosidases and hydroxynitrile lyase may play a key role in amygdalin degradation. The predicted degradation initiated by β-glycosidases that hydrolyze α-glucosidic bonds of amygdalin results in α-hydroxy nitriles (cyanohydrins) that are subsequently converted into carbonyl compounds (benzaldehyde) and hydrogen cyanide catalyzed by hydroxynitrile lyases.

Jet lag is a challenge for transmeridian travelers, while fatigue and alterations to gastrointestinal comfort are associated with many types of long-haul travel. Planning food and fluid intake that is appropriate to the travel itinerary may help to reduce problems. Resynchronization of the body clock is achieved principally through manipulation of zeitgebers, such as light exposure; more investigation of the effects of melatonin, caffeine, and the timing/composition of meals will allow clearer guidelines for their contribution to be prepared. At the destination, the athlete, the team management, and catering providers each play a role in achieving eating practices that support optimal performance and success in achieving the goals of the trip.

A combination of genetic, physiological and environmental factors produces individual differences in chronotype (entrained phase as manifest in sleep timing). A mismatch between circadian and societal (e.g., work) clocks leads to a condition called social jetlag, which is characterized by changing sleep times over work and free days and accumulation of sleep debt. Social jetlag, which is prevalent in late chronotypes, has been related to several health issues. One way to reduce social jetlag would be to advance the circadian clock via modifications of the light environment. We thus performed two intervention field studies to describe methods for decreasing social jetlag. One study decreased evening light exposure (via blue-light-blocking glasses) and the other used increased morning light (via the use of curtains). We measured behaviour as well as melatonin; the latter in order to validate that behaviour was consistent with this neuroendocrinological phase marker of the circadian clock. We found that a decrease in evening blue light exposure led to an advance in melatonin and sleep onset on workdays. Increased morning light exposure advanced neither melatonin secretion nor sleep timing. Neither protocol led to a significant change in social jetlag. Despite this, our findings show that controlling light exposure at home can be effective in advancing melatonin secretion and sleep, thereby helping late chronotypes to better cope with early social schedules.",0.9998358488082886

This study compared three morning bright-light exposure patterns from a single light box (to mimic home treatment) in combination with afternoon melatonin. Methods: Fifty adults (27 males) aged 25.9 ± 5.1 years participated. Sleep/dark was advanced 1 h/day for three treatment days. Participants took 0.5 mg of melatonin 5 h before the baseline bedtime on treatment day 1, and an hour earlier each treatment day. They were exposed to one of three bright-light (~5000 lux) patterns upon waking each morning: four 30-min exposures separated by 30 min of room light (2-h group), four 15-min exposures separated by 45 min of room light (1-h group), and one 30-min exposure (0.5-h group). Dim-light melatonin onsets (DLMOs) before and after treatment determined the phase advance. Results: Compared to the 2-h group (phase shift = 2.4 ± 0.8 h), smaller phase-advance shifts were seen in the 1-h (1.7 ± 0.7 h) and 0.5-h (1.8 ± 0.8 h) groups.

Aerobics, stretching and Resistive exercises for 8-12 weeks, either supervised or unsupervised, relieves pain. Exercises are believed to cause hormonal changes in the uterine lining, which reduces PD symptoms. Researchers have presumed different pain-relieving methods, ranging from non-opioids to opioids to hormonal for variations in pain sensitivity. Exercise-induced analgesia provides the central pathway as the primary mechanism for pain reduction while, another way to reducing pain in PD may be a hormonal interaction. The hormonal changes causing exercise-induced pain modulation during the menstruation cycle is not clearly understood and the interaction and activation of all the central and endocrine components, which is a complex mechanism, is also not explained clearly. This study briefly reviews the physiological mechanism of Exercise-induced analgesia and its potent roles in controlling the pathogenesis of PD for pain relief.",0.9998904466629028
11,2019,35290742,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,"Objective: Low back pain (LBP) and falls are among the major problems experienced by the elderly population. The present study investigated the effectiveness of an 8-week virtual reality training (VRT) program in helping relieve pain, minimize fall risk, and improve quality of life (QoL) in elderly women suffering from chronic LBP (CLBP). Materials and Methods: Twenty-five elderly women (VRT/intervention group = 13, control group = 12) with CLBP and aged 65 to 75 years were recruited. The VRT involved three 30-minute weekly sessions of exercises that were carried out using the Xbox Kinect headset. Pain intensity, fall risk, and QoL were assessed via the Visual Analog Scale, the Biodex Balance System, and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, respectively. Results: The outcomes of a one-way analysis of covariance indicated that the pain intensity score of the intervention group significantly decreased after participation in the VRT program ( P = 0.001). The intervention group also showed reduced fall risk ( P = 0.001) and elevated QoL ( P = 0.001). Conclusion: The results confirmed that the VRT program can be regarded as a valid therapeutic intervention that helps reduce patients' symptoms and increase the effectiveness of exercises in the elderly by teaching pain-related insight as well as enhancing QoL and reduce fall risk through various movements.",0.9998608827590942
11,2019,35270384,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,"Background: Several interventions have been used to relieve chronic low back pain (CLBP). This study aimed to compare the effects of pain neuroscience education (PNE) followed by motor control exercises (MCEs) with core stability training (CST) on pain, disability, and balance in women with CLBP. Methods: Thirty-seven women with CLBP were randomly divided into two groups of PNE/MCE (n = 18, 55.2 ± 2.6 years) or CST (n = 19, 54.6 ± 2.4 years). Eight weeks of PNE/MCE or CST were prescribed for each group, independently. Pain intensity (VAS scale), disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire), unipodal static balance, and dynamic balance (time up and go test) were measured at the beginning and 8 weeks after the intervention. Two-way mixed ANOVA was used to analyze the results with alpha of 5%. Results: After 8 weeks, there was a significant difference in VAS scale between groups ( p = 0.024), with both PNE/MCE and CST showing 58% and 42% reductions, respectively. There were no differences for all other variables between groups. Regarding pre- to post-comparisons, both groups showed improvements in all dependent variables ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The treatment with PNE/MCE was more effective in improving pain disability and unipodal static and dynamic balance than treatment with CST. Even so, both treatments were shown to be valid and safe in improving all dependent variables analyzed in women with CLBP.",0.9998693466186523
11,2019,35223304,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,"Lifelong, pregnancy-induced low back pain forced me to search for solutions to the problem of pain. Currently, low back pain is often diagnosed as ""nonspecific"" and, as a result, a multitude of tests and poorly effective, at times side effect-laden or habit-forming treatments are recommended. My quest for relief took me to first diagnose my pain as coming from the sacroiliac joints, then to prolotherapy, the first treatment which brought me prolonged relief. I then learned how to perform prolotherapy. In 2009, when I undertook a randomized controlled study of dextrose prolotherapy for rotator cuff tendinopathy, I restricted my practice to treating pain. As low back pain was a large part of my practice, I sought new ways to examine the sacroiliac joints. I conducted a consecutive patient data collection which suggested that over three-quarters of those with low back pain suffer from displaced sacroiliac joints. In a further randomized controlled study, I found that the two-minute corrective exercise I derived from this test provided immediate relief to 90% of those using it. With Dr. John Clark Lyftogt I discovered the safety and effectiveness of 5% dextrose perineural injections to provide immediate pain relief to any area supplied by a nerve I could reach with my needle. As I was treating many diabetics with peripheral neuropathy, I shifted my perineural injection material to 5% mannitol, which may be as effective, with less exposure to dextrose as a potential benefit for diabetics. As most people dislike injections, a pharmacist and I developed a mannitol-containing topical cream for pain relief. We compared a base cream to the same cream with mannitol on lips pretreated with capsaicin cream which made them burn. By 10 minutes the probability the two creams were as effective in relieving the burn was less than 0.001 in favor of mannitol. When given to 235 patients with a total of 289 different painful conditions, we found that it provided 53% relief in an average of 16 minutes with a median of four hours duration. Now retired, after 55 years of medical practice, I love to relieve the pain of friends and fellow hikers using exercise and cream. Searching for and finding solutions to chronic pain has enriched my life and that of many others.",0.9998875856399536

This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of a 3-day novel structured exercise on reducing musculoskeletal pain from the face-down posture in 61 participants (31 in the exercise group) who underwent vitrectomy. Among the subjects, the median age was 62 years, 42 were female, 42 had macular holes, and 19 had retinal detachments. Participants in the exercise group received initial education on the exercise and performed three daily active exercise sessions. After the sessions, the exercise group had median numeric pain scores of 2, 1, and 1 at the back neck, shoulder, and lower back, respectively, while the control group had corresponding scores of 5, 3, and 4, respectively. The exercise group reported significantly lower pain scores (P = .003, .039, and .006 for the back neck, shoulder, and lower back, respectively).

If conservative treatment cannot relieve the symptoms or correct the deformities, surgical treatment is usually needed. For severe kyphotic deformity, reconstruction of the physiological curvature and rigid fixation determine the prognosis of the patients. Osteotomy and orthopedics are the standard procedure for deformities with severe compression of the front and middle column, but the trauma to the patients is high, with a long operation time and massive blood loss. To avoid these disadvantages, we have developed a modified technique to remove the diseased vertebra unilaterally. In this technique, we use a modified trephine to resect the vertebral columns like in the pedicle screw technique by adding a locking instrument that can restrict the trephine to lower the risk of osteotomy and shorten the surgery time and blood loss.",0.9994826316833496
13,2019,36161170,Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,antidepressants low-back pain,0.0,"Purpose: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the leading causes of low-back pain and results in a series of clinical symptoms, including pain, reflex loss, and muscle weakness. Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) can relieve pain and promote internal and external stabilization of the lumbar spine. In this study, we investigated whether the brain alterations of LDH patients with SMT were frequency-dependent based on the calculation of Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF). Further, we established a cohort of LDH patients to evaluate the contribution of SMT treatments to brain functional reorganization. Methods: A total of 55 participants, including 27 LDH patients and 28 health controls (HCs), were collected. All LDH patients underwent two fMRI scans (before SMT and after the sixth SMT session). To represent LDH-related brain oscillatory activities, we calculated the ALFF and fALFF in the conventional band (0.01-0.08 Hz), the slow-4 band (0.027-0.073 Hz), and the slow-5 band (0.01-0.027 Hz). Moreover, we extracted ALFF and fALFF values in clusters with significant differences to evaluate the SMT effect. Results: Compared with HCs, the LDH patients before SMT (LDH-pre) exhibited increased fALFF in right lingual gyri in the conventional band, and showed increased fALFF in left Cerebelum_Crus1 in the slow-4 band. We further examined the abnormal brain activities changes before and after the SMT intervention. The ALFF and fALFF values of LDH-pre group were higher than those of the HCs and LDH-pos groups. After SMT, the increased ALFF and fALFF values were suppressed for patients in conventional band and slow-4 band. Conclusion: The present study characterized the altered regional patterns in spontaneous neural activity in patients with LDH. Meanwhile, SMT is an effective treatment of LDH, and we supposed that it might have been involved in modulating dysfunctional brain regions which are important for the processing of pain. The findings of the current study may provide new insights to understand pathological mechanism of LDH.",0.9753509163856506

To develop novel therapeutics, animal models are needed to examine the mechanisms and effectiveness of novel therapies from a translational perspective. Several rodent models of back pain are used in current investigations. Surprisingly, however, no standardized behavioral test was validated to assess mechanical sensitivity in back pain models. This is critical to confirm that animals with presumed back pain present local hypersensitivity to nociceptive stimuli, and to monitor sensitivity during interventions designed to relieve back pain. The objective of this study is to lay down a simple and accessible test to assess mechanical sensitivity in the back of rats. A test cage was fabricated specifically for this method; length x width x height: 50 x 20 x 7 cm, having a stainless-steel mesh on the top. This test cage allows the application of mechanical stimuli to the back. To perform the test, the back of the animal is shaved in the region of interest, and the test area is marked to repeat the test on different days, as needed. The mechanical threshold is determined with Von Frey filaments applied to the paraspinal muscles, utilizing the up-down method described previously. The positive responses include (1) muscle twitching, (2) arching (back extension), (3) rotation of the neck (4) scratching or licking the back, and (5) escaping. This behavioral test (Back Mechanical Sensitivity (BMS) test) is useful for mechanistic research with rodent models of back pain for the development of therapeutic interventions for the prevention and management of back pain.",0.09435677528381348

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of factors associated with increased social distance and social withdrawal. Exercise therapy is an effective means to social impairment. However, whether exercise could reduce social distance in patients with CLBP remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of exercise on social distance in middle-aged and elderly patients with CLBP. Methods: The longitudinal intervention recruited 29 middle-aged and elderly patients with CLBP from various communities in Yangpu District, Shanghai, China. The participants received exercise intervention for 8 weeks. The assessments were conducted before and after the intervention, including social distance, pain intensity, unpleasantness of pain, Roland-Morris Questionnaire (RMDQ), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Intention to treat analysis was performed. Results: After the 8-week exercise intervention, the social distance of patients with CLBP was shorter than that before intervention and showed significant difference ( p 0.05). The scores of pain intensity, unpleasantness of pain, RMDQ, SAS, and SDS also decreased and were significantly different between pre- and post-intervention ( p 0.05). In addition, the social distance, pain intensity, unpleasantness of pain, RMDQ, SAS, and SDS scores of the moderate CLBP group decreased more after the intervention compared with those of the mild CLBP group.

Although there is evidence that non-pharmacological therapies seem to be effective for treating low back pain, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of EMG biofeedback with non-specific chronic low back pain (NCLBP). The purpose of this study is, therefore, to determine the efficacy of a portable EMG biofeedback device on pain in individuals with CLBP. Methods/design: This study is a prospective, single-center, assessor-blind, two-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial to be conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA. Eighty patients with CLBP will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive sEMG-BF (surface EMG biofeedback) or continued care (no intervention). All participants will receive treatment virtually weekly for 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be pain intensity (Brief Pain Inventory). The secondary outcomes will include pain interference (Brief Pain Inventory), disability (The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 3 months follow-up. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this study will be the first powered randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of a virtual sEMG-BF protocol specifically designed for CLBP.

Transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) has been used to treat radicular pain, and after the injection, additional medications such as gabapentinoids including pregabalin (PGB) and gabapentin (GBP) can be administered to relieve remnant pain. However, little is known about the effectiveness of gabapentinoids in relieving pain after transforaminal epidural steroid injection. This study was conducted to compare the effect of pregabalin and gabapentin in lumbar radiculopathy patients who underwent transforaminal epidural steroid injection. One hundred seven patients who received TFESI and had taken PGB or GBP after the intervention at Daegu Catholic University Medical Center from January 2013 to August 2021 were included in this study. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was evaluated in all patients. Among 107 patients, 57 (53.3%) patients took PGB and 50 (46.7%) patients took GBP after TFESI. The PGB and GBP groups showed reduced VAS scores according to visit (P .001). However, no statistically significant differences in VAS scores according to the types of medication (P = .811) and change aspects according to visit were observed between the PGB and GBP groups (P = .947).

For endometriosis such as deep endometriosis and ovarian endometrioid cysts, surgery is the most effective treatment. Long-term follow-up showed that the recurrence rate of endometriosis after surgical treatment was high, so postoperative drugs were needed to reduce recurrence, and Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a) were the most commonly used drug for postoperative management.GnRH-a may reduce the post-treatment endometriosis relapses by lowering the hormone levels in the body. However, the use of GnRH-a can give rise to perimenopausal symptoms, especially osteoporosis, bone loss, and bone pain, for which reason GnRH-a use is often limited. The add-back therapy is often used to alleviate the untoward effects caused by GnRH-a. However, long-term use of hormone drugs may lead to EMS recurrence, thrombosis, and breast cancer. Therefore, a safer and more effective drug is urgently needed to alleviate the untoward effects caused by GnRH-a. In recent years, scholars at home and abroad have found that isopropanolic Cimicifuga racemosa extract (ICR), as a plant extract, can better relieve the symptoms of perimenopausal women. At the same time, some studies have initially confirmed that black cohosh preparations can relieve the perimenopausal symptoms caused by GnRH-a treatment in EMS patients. Objective: To investigate the effect of black cohosh preparations on the bone metabolism of rat models with GnRH-a-induced perimenopausal symptoms. Methods: The rat models of perimenopausal symptoms were established by GnRH-a injection. and normal saline (NS injection) was used as the control. According to the modeling method and drug intervention, the rats were randomly divided into four groups: GnRH-a injection + saline intervention group (GnRH-a + NS), saline injection control + saline intervention group (NS + NS), GnRH-a injection + estradiol intervention group (GnRH-a + E2), and GnRH-a injection + black cohosh preparation intervention group (GnRH-a + ICR). The rat models were identified with the vaginal smear method, and then the corresponding drug intervention was administrated for 28 days. After the intervention, the rats were sacrificed. The rats' bone mineral density (BMD) of the distal femur was detected by a dual-energy X-ray bone density scanner. Rat tibia bone tissues were decalcified and made into slices. The pathological and morphological changes of rat tibial bones in each group were observed through HE staining. Histomorphometry parameters of rat tibial bones in each group, such as trabecular bone volume (TBV), trabecular thickness (TbTh), trabecular number (TbN), and trabecular spacing (TbSp), were detected and analyzed by using an automatic image analysis system. Results: (1) The BMD level of the distal femur in the GnRH-a + NS group was significantly lower than the NS + NS, GnRH-a + E2, and GnRH-a + ICR groups ( P 0.01), the BMD levels in GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups were slightly lower than the NS + NS group, but there was no significant difference among the three groups ( P &gt;0.05). (2) The pathological changes of the tibia bones under the microscope in different groups were as follows: The tibia bone trabecular structure was normal in the NS + NS group, without trabecular thinning or fracture, and the arch structure was normal. In the GnRH-a + NS group, some trabecular structures tapered, the arch structure disappeared, but no obvious bone fracture was observed in the trabecula. In the GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups, the trabecular structures were normal, without trabecular bone thinning or fracture, and the arch structures were normal. (3) The TBV level of the GnRH-a + INS group was significantly lower than that of the NS + NS, GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups ( P 0.01, P 0.05, P 0.01), while there was no significant difference among NS + NS, GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups ( P &gt;0.05). (4) The TbTh levels in the four groups had no significant difference ( P &gt;0.05). Compared with the NS + NS group, the TbTh levels in the GnRH-a + NS, GnRH-a + E2, and GnRH-a + ICR groups showed a descending tendency, while the TbTh levels in the GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups were slightly higher than that of the GnRH-a + NS group. However, such differences were not significant statistically (P&gt;0.05). (5) Compared with the NS + NS group, the TbN levels in the GnRH-a + NS, GnRH-a + E2, and GnRH-a + ICR groups decreased remarkably ( P 0.05). Compared with the GnRH-a + NS group, the TbN levels in the GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups showed a mild descending tendency, but such differences were not significant statistically ( P &gt;0.05). (6) The TbSp level of the GnRH-a + NS group was significantly higher than that of the NS + NS, GnRH-a + E2, and GnRH-a + ICR groups ( P 0.01), while there was no significant difference among NS + NS, GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups ( P &gt;0.05).

Typically, such cramps have no obvious underlying pathology, and so are termed idiopathic. Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps but the efficacy of magnesium for this purpose remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012, and performed to identify and incorporate more recent studies. Objectives: To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation compared to no treatment, placebo control or other cramp therapies in people with skeletal muscle cramps. SEARCH METHODS: On 9 September 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and SPORTDiscus. We also searched WHO-ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov for registered trials that might be ongoing or unpublished, and ISI Web of Science for studies citing the studies included in this review. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of magnesium supplementation (in any form) to prevent skeletal muscle cramps in any patient group (i.e. all clinical presentations of cramp). We considered comparisons of magnesium with no treatment, placebo control, or other therapy. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Two review authors assessed risk of bias. We attempted to contact all study authors when questions arose and obtained participant-level data for four of the included trials, one of which was unpublished. We collected all data on adverse effects from the included RCTs. Main results: We identified 11 trials (nine parallel-group, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 735 individuals, amongst whom 118 cross-over participants additionally served as their own controls. Five trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps (408 participants) and five trials enrolled people with idiopathic cramps (271 participants, with 118 additionally crossed over to control). Another study enrolled 29 people with liver cirrhosis, only some of whom suffered muscle cramps. All trials provided magnesium as an oral supplement, except for one trial which provided magnesium as a series of slow intravenous infusions. Nine trials compared magnesium to placebo, one trial compared magnesium to no treatment, calcium carbonate or vitamin B, and another trial compared magnesium to vitamin E or calcium. We judged the single trial in people with liver cirrhosis and all five trials in participants with pregnancy-associated leg cramps to be at high risk of bias. In contrast, we rated the risk of bias high in only one of five trials in participants with idiopathic rest cramps. For idiopathic cramps, largely in older adults (mean age 61.6 to 69.3 years) presumed to have nocturnal leg cramps (the commonest presentation), differences in measures of cramp frequency when comparing magnesium to placebo were small, not statistically significant, and showed minimal heterogeneity (I² = 0% to 12%). This includes the primary endpoint, percentage change from baseline in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (mean difference (MD) -9.59%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -23.14% to 3.97%; 3 studies, 177 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the difference in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (MD -0.18 cramps/week, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.49; 5 studies, 307 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 3 studies, 177 participants; high-certainty evidence). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found at four weeks in measures of cramp intensity or cramp duration. This includes the number of participants rating their cramps as moderate or severe at four weeks (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.21; 2 studies, 91 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the percentage of participants with the majority of cramp durations of one minute or more at four weeks (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.53, 1 study, 46 participants; low-certainty evidence). We were unable to perform meta-analysis for trials of pregnancy-associated leg cramps. The single study comparing magnesium to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a three-point ordinal scale of overall treatment efficacy. Of the three trials comparing magnesium to placebo, one found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures, another found benefit for both, and a third reported inconsistent results for frequency that could not be reconciled. The single study in people with liver cirrhosis was small and had limited reporting of cramps, but found no difference in terms of cramp frequency or cramp intensity. Our analysis of adverse events pooled all studies, regardless of the setting in which cramps occurred. Major adverse events (occurring in 2 out of 72 magnesium recipients and 3 out of 68 placebo recipients), and withdrawals due to adverse events, were not significantly different from placebo. However, in the four studies for which it could be determined, more participants experienced minor adverse events in the magnesium group than in the placebo group (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.33; 4 studies, 254 participants; low-certainty evidence). Overall, oral magnesium was associated with mostly gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g. diarrhoea), experienced by 11% (10% in control) to 37% (14% in control) of participants. Authors' conclusions: It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this population is needed. We found no RCTs evaluating magnesium for exercise-associated muscle cramps or disease-state-associated muscle cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease) other than a single small (inconclusive) study in people with liver cirrhosis, only some of whom suffered cramps.",0.9996063113212585
16,2019,31350753,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"Background: Recent investigations have questioned the role of hydration and electrolytes in cramp susceptibility and thus the efficacy of consuming electrolyte-rich carbohydrate beverages (EB) to control/prevent cramping. Methods: Nine euhydrated, cramp-prone participants had their cramp susceptibility assessed by measuring the nerve stimulation threshold frequency at which cramping occurs (TF) before and after consumption of an EB (kCal: 120, Na: 840 mg, K: 320 mg, Mg: 5 mg) and placebo beverage (PB: kCal: 5, Na: 35 mg). Cramp intensity was assessed using a verbal pain scale and poststimulation electromyography (EMG). Results: TF was greater in EB (14.86 ± 7.47 Hz) than PB (14.00 ± 5.03 Hz; P = .038) and reported pain was lower in EB (2.0 ± 0.6) than PB (2.7 ± 0.8; P = .025) while EMG was similar (P = .646). Discussion: EB consumption decreased cramp susceptibility and pain but did not prevent cramping in any participants. These results suggest that electrolyte consumption independent of hydration can influence cramp susceptibility in young people.",0.0002997946285177022

Denosumab is indicated to prevent skeletal-related events (SREs) from osteoporosis and metastatic bone disease. We report a case of denosumab-induced hypocalcemia to highlight potential toxicity and treatment considerations. A 66-year-old man with prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer, and bone metastases presented with fatigue, weakness, and muscle spasm. Sixteen days prior, he received cycle 6 of cisplatin and etoposide, leuprolide, and denosumab (120 mg subcutaneously). His examination demonstrated a slight resting tremor, normal strength, and negative Chvostek sign. Laboratory analysis revealed hemoglobin, 8.0 g/dL; total calcium, 5.2 mg/dL (pre-denosumab, 8.9 mg/dL); and magnesium, 0.7 mg/dL. He initially received two units packed red blood cells, intravenous calcium and magnesium, and vitamin D. During his hospitalization, he required multiple doses of intravenous and oral calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. Despite ongoing oral supplementation, his post-discharge serum calcium fluctuated significantly, requiring close monitoring and frequent dose adjustments. Denosumab's unique antiresorptive properties yield fewer SREs. The trade-off is increased hypocalcemia risk, which may be severe and require aggressive, prolonged supplementation and monitoring.",0.2546684145927429
16,2019,24297951,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"Purpose: Cumulative neurotoxicity is a prominent toxicity of oxaliplatin-based therapy. Intravenous calcium and magnesium have been extensively used to reduce oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity. This trial was designed to definitively test whether calcium/magnesium decreases oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity. Patients and methods: In all, 353 patients with colon cancer undergoing adjuvant therapy with FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) were randomly assigned to intravenous calcium/magnesium before and after oxaliplatin, a placebo before and after, or calcium/magnesium before and placebo after. The primary end point was cumulative neurotoxicity measured by the sensory scale of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy 20 tool. Results: There were no statistically significant neuropathy differences among the study arms as measured by the primary end point or additional measures of neuropathy, including clinician-determined measurement of the time to grade 2 neuropathy by using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale or an oxaliplatin-specific neuropathy scale. In addition, calcium/magnesium did not substantially decrease oxaliplatin-induced acute neuropathy. Conclusion: This study does not support using calcium/magnesium to protect against oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity.",0.00031076569575816393
16,2019,22972143,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"Background: Skeletal muscle cramps are common and often presented to physicians in association with pregnancy, advanced age, exercise or disorders of the motor neuron (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps but the efficacy of magnesium for this indication has never been evaluated by systematic review. Objectives: To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation compared to no treatment, placebo control or other cramp therapies in people with skeletal muscle cramps.

Three trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps (N = 202) and four trials enrolled idiopathic cramp sufferers (N = 322 including cross-over controls). Magnesium was compared to placebo in six trials and to no treatment in one trial.For idiopathic cramps (largely older adults presumed to have nocturnal leg cramps), differences in measures of cramp frequency, magnesium versus placebo, were small, not statistically significant, and without heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%). This includes the primary endpoint, percentage change from baseline in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (-3.93%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21.12% to 13.26%, moderate quality evidence) and the difference in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (0.01 cramps/week, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.55, moderate quality evidence). The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different, being 8% lower in the magnesium group (95% CI -28% to 12%, moderate quality evidence). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found at four weeks in measures of cramp intensity (moderate quality evidence) or cramp duration (low quality evidence).Meta-analysis was not possible for trials of pregnancy-associated leg cramps.

The two trials comparing magnesium to placebo differed in that one trial found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures while the other found benefit for both.Withdrawals due to adverse events were not significantly different than placebo. While we could not determine the number of subjects with minor adverse events, studies of oral magnesium generally described potential side effects as similar in frequency to placebo.

When cooling is rapidly initiated and both the body temperature and cognitive function return to the normal range within an hour of onset of symptoms, most patients recover fully. Immersion in an ice-water bath is the most effective cooling method, and evaporative cooling is a rapid and effective alternative. To prevent the development of rhabdomyolysis-induced acute renal failure, aggressive IV rehydration should be continued for first 24 to 72 hours with the goal of maintaining a minimum urine output of 2 mL/kg/h. Treatment of heat cramps also consists of fluid and salt replacement (PO or IV) and rest in a cool environment. In severe cases, IV magnesium sulphate may be effective to relieve muscle cramping.",0.9997240900993347
16,2019,21275297,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"Radial access angioplasty has increased in popularity worldwide due to its decrease of access site complications, early patient mobility, patient comfort and lower costs. In a minority of patients, radial artery occlusion and radial artery spasm occurs. Because of the dual blood supply to the hand, radial artery occlusion is not associated with major clinical sequelae but prevention is important. Radial artery spasm rarely leads to serious vascular complications but can cause patient discomfort and can result in prolonging or failure of the procedure. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies have been evaluated to prevent radial artery occlusion and radial artery spasm. A number of pharmacological 'cocktails' have been successfully tested but there is currently no agreement on the optimal combination of agents. In order to evaluate the best strategy to prevent radial artery occlusion and radial artery spasm we reviewed the relevant studies to date. From these studies it is clear that a 'cocktail' of agents should be given before transradial coronary angiography or angioplasty. A combination of heparin, nitroglycerin and verapamil is associated with the best preventive outcome.",0.0036379171069711447
16,2019,10548155,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"Although there is general agreement that chronic ingestion of alcohol poses great risks for normal cardiovascular functions and peripheral-vascular homeostasis, a direct cause and effect between the real phenomena of alcohol-induced headache and risk of brain injury and stroke is not appreciated. ""Binge drinking"" of alcohol is associated with an ever-growing number of strokes and sudden death. It is becoming clear that alcohol ingestion can result in profoundly different actions on the cerebral circulation (e.g., vasodilation, vasoconstriction-spasm, vessel rupture), depending upon dose and physiologic state of host. Using rats, it has been demonstrated that acute, high doses of ethanol can result in stroke-like events concomitant with alterations in brain bioenergetics. We review recent in vivo findings obtained with 31P-NMR spectroscopy, optical reflectance spectroscopy, and direct in vivo microcirculatory studies on the intact brain. Alcohol-induced hemorrhagic stroke is preceded by a rapid fall in brain intracellular free magnesium ions ([Mg2+]i) followed by cerebrovasospasm and reductions in phosphocreatine (PCr)/ATP ratio, intracellular pH, and the cytosolic phosphorylation potential (CPP) with concomitant rises in deoxyhemoglobin (DH), mitochondrial reduced cytochrome oxidase aa3 (rCOaa3), blood volume, and intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi). Using osmotic mini-pumps implanted in the third cerebral ventricle, containing 30% ethanol, it was found that brain [Mg2+]i is reduced 30% after 14 days; brain PCr fell 15%, whereas the CPP fell 40%. Such animals became susceptible to stroke from nonlethal doses of ethanol. Human subjects with mild head injury have been found to exhibit early deficits in serum ionized Mg (IMg2+); the greater the degree of early head injury (30 min-8 h), the greater and more profound the deficit in serum IMg2+ and the greater the ionized Ca (ICa2+) to IMg2+ ratio. Patients with histories of alcohol abuse or ingestion of alcohol prior to head injury exhibited greater deficits in IMg2+ (and higher ICa2+/IMg2+ ratios) and, unlike the subjects without alcohol, did not leave the hospital for at least several days. Women, for some unknown reason, exhibit a much higher incidence of morbidity and mortality from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) than men. Data on 105 men and women with different types of stroke indicate that, on the average, a 20% deficit in serum IMg2+ is seen; total Mg (TMg) or blood pH is usually near normal. Women with SAH, however, exhibit much lower IMg2+ and higher ICa2+/IMg2+ ratios; the presence of ethanol in the blood is associated with even more depression in IMg2+ in SAH in women. It is possible that prior alcohol ingestion is, in large measure, responsible for a great deal of this unexplained higher incidence of SAH in women. It has recently been reported that the cyclical changes in estrogenic hormones appear to control the serum IMg2+ level in young women. A surge in estrogenic levels prior to SAH could thus precipitate, in part, the SAH. In other human studies, it has been shown that migraines and headache, dizziness, and hangover, which accompany ethanol ingestion, are associated with rapid deficits in serum IMg2+ but not in TMg. The former, and the alcohol-associated headache, can be ameliorated with IV administration of MgSO4. Premenstrual tension-headache (PTH) and its exacerbation by alcohol in women is also accompanied by deficits in IMg2+, and elevation in serum ICa2+/IMg2+; IV MgSO4 corrects the PTH and the serum deficit in IMg2+. Animal experiments show that IV Mg2+ can prevent alcohol-induced hemorrhagic stroke and the subsequent fall in brain [Mg2+]i, [PCr], pHi, and CPP. Other recent data indicate that alcohol-induced cellular loss of [Mg2+]i is associated with cellular Ca2+ overload and generation of oxygen-derived free radicals; chronic pretreatment with vitamin E prevents alcohol-induced vascular injury and pathology in the brain.

The aim of this study is to design a tailored biopsychosocial intervention for patients with low back pain to prevent pain chronicity. Design: A multidisciplinary empirical approach. Methods: A multidisciplinary team designed a biopsychosocial intervention following an application from the Medical Research Council's complex intervention framework. The methods used included problem identification, identification of the evidence, theory, and needs, examination of the current context and modelling of the theory. Biomechanical, psychological, social and environmental, and lifestyle and personal risk factors were taken into account. Results: The intervention process was introduced in a logic model. The model presents all the required resources, their activities and outputs, as well as the outcomes and impacts of the intervention. The intervention was tailored according to the underlying risk factors for pain chronification in patients with low back pain. Conclusion: A comprehensive tailored intervention may decrease the risk of pain chronicity.

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic inflammatory disease that may cause or aggravate IVDD; however, the mechanism by which diabetes induce IVDD is currently unclear. Compared to non-diabetic individuals, diabetic patients have higher levels of plasma cytokines, especially TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, and IL-18. Due to the crucial role of cytokines in the process of intervertebral disc degeneration, we hypothesized that elevation of these cytokines in plasma of diabetic patients may be involved in the process of diabetes-induced IVDD. In this review, changes in plasma cytokine levels in diabetic patients were summarized and the potential role of elevated cytokines in diabetes-induced IVDD was discussed. Results showed that some cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β may accelerate the development of IVDD, while others such as IL-10 is supposed to prevent its development. Apoptosis, senescence, and extracellular matrix metabolism were found to be regulated by these cytokines in IVDD. Further studies are required to validate the cytokines targeted strategy for diabetic IVDD therapy.",0.9731937646865845

The disease process usually manifests fully by the second decade of life. Total colectomy or restorative proctocolectomy is often required to prevent the development of colorectal adenocarcinoma. Routine surveillance following surgery is critical for the early detection of polyps or malignancy. We present a rare case of a 31-year-old male with a history of FAP status post total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) who presented with acute exacerbation of lower back pain and new-onset lower extremity paresthesia. Imaging demonstrated an aggressive T12 vertebral body lesion. Pathology following laminectomy demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma. Subsequent pouchoscopy revealed a distal 1.5-cm pedunculated lesion arising from remnant rectal tissue with pathology confirming moderately differentiated rectal adenocarcinoma. This patient underwent a prophylactic proctocolectomy 20 years prior to this admission but was lost to follow-up prior to any endoscopic evaluations. Despite postoperative surveillance guidelines and patient counseling, follow-up and recommended endoscopic evaluation are often inadequate.

Here, we show a proof-of-concept evaluation of our low-back exoskeleton. Its peculiar feature is the backbone-tracking kinematic structure that allows tracking the motion of the human spine while bending the trunk. This mechanism is implemented with a rigid-yet-elongating structure that does not hinder nor constrain the motion of the wearer while providing assistance. In this work, we show the first prototype we manufactured. It is equipped with a traction spring to assist the wearer during trunk flexion/extension. Then, we report the results of a preliminary test with healthy subjects. We measured a reduction of the mean absolute value for some target muscles - including the erector spinae - when using the exoskeleton for payload manipulation tasks. This was achieved without affecting task performance, measured as task time and joints range of motion.

Various studies have revealed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and extracellular matrix (ECM) degeneration play a vital role in initiating and developing the progression of IVDD. Moreover, restoration of SIRT1/AMPK was confirmed to prevent IVDD and damage via maintaining ER and extracellular homeostasis. In addition, orientin (Ori) has been shown to upregulate SIRT1. However, the effect of Ori in nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) is not determined. Hence, in this study we aim to explore the function of Ori in IVDD pathological model. The results demonstrate that Ori treatment in vitro increased SIRT1/AMPK in NPCs, maintained ECM and ER balance and decreased oxidative stress (OS) response. Ori rescued the disordered homeostasis stimulated by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), and its function can be inhibited by thapsigargin (TG). Compound C and EX-527, inhibitors of AMPK and SIRT1 counteracted the Ori-mediated ER stress elimination. These results confirm that Ori exerts its effects by upregulating AMPK and SIRT1. Puncture-stimulated IVDD rats were used to show that Ori attenuates the pathological development in vivo. In all, we partly unveil the underlying mechanisms of Ori in IVDD.",0.9995662569999695

Best practice guidelines recommend the use of exercise to slow the rate of bone loss, to maintain muscle strength and physical function, and to prevent falls and further fractures. However, treatment effects are often small and difficult to sustain and adherence, or the extent to which patients engage in treatment, has been identified as an important issue by many studies. Our hypothesis is that integrating adherence intervention strategies with an exercise intervention will be beneficial. We will compare physiotherapy exercise rehabilitation with adherence support versus physiotherapy exercise rehabilitation alone in terms of effects on (A) physical function, quality of life and fear of falling and (B) exercise self-efficacy and adherence. Methods and analysis: A multicentre, two-arm, parallel group, superiority randomised controlled trial with blinded assessments at baseline (0) and 4, 8 and 12 months, with a nested qualitative study and health economic analysis. 116 participants will be allocated to either (1) outpatient physiotherapy which will include a musculoskeletal assessment and treatment including balance, posture, strength training and low impact weight-bearing exercises over 16 weeks or (2) OsteoPorosis Tailored exercise adherence INtervention intervention.

At a two-month follow-up, imaging showed a fracture, compression and lesion enlargement. Decompression and fixation confirmed ES, and the patient began combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Two months postoperatively, residual ES was suspected on MRI. The patient underwent a second surgery, and histopathology confirmed necrosis. A six-month follow-up after the first surgery showed no tumor recurrence. This case supports the inclusion of ES in the differential diagnosis of pathologic spinal fracture.

We evaluated the effectiveness and tolerance of systemic steroid use in a cohort of patients with ALRP. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 56 patients (including 24 females) were admitted with intractable ALRP resistance to conservative treatment of NSAIDs and opiates between the years 2016 and 2018. Medical records were studied for demographics, physical examination findings, Visual Analogue Score (VAS), IV steroids side effects, and recent imaging findings. All patients received a daily dose of IV 24 mg Dexamethasone until discharge, SNRB, or surgery. Results: The average IV steroid treatment was 3.9 (±2.8) days, with most patients showing significant pain relief allowing discharge (69.7%). SNRB was required in 19.6% and surgical intervention in 10.7% within the same admission. Multivariate analysis did not find any parameter to predict treatment failure (age, gender, motor/sensory deficit, CT/MRI findings). The motor deficit, positive straight leg raising (SLR), and dural sac compression on CT were higher in the intervention group but did not reach statistical significance. One patient required discontinuation of IV steroids due to elevated blood pressure. Conclusions: Despite the insufficient evidence in the literature, IV steroid treatment is still a viable option in ALRP treatment, with pain relief allowing discharge in 70% of patients and a low complication rate. Our study found daily 24 mg IV dexamethasone for ALRP to be an effective treatment and helpful in most patients admitted.

Treatment of an acute episode of LBP generally includes rest, activity modification, physical therapy, NSAIDs, and patient education. Recent findings: A small percentage of patients will develop chronic pain lasting &gt; 6 months duration. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is one of the main pillars of regenerative medicine, as its release of bioactive proteins supports the aim of RM of restoring the anatomical function in degenerative conditions. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells, multipotent progenitor cells, or marrow stromal cells found in various body tissues, including bone marrow, lung, and adipose tissue. Evidence from well-designed case-control or cohort studies for the use of PRP and MSCs in lumbar facet joint, lumbar epidural, and sacroiliac joint injections is currently described as level IV evidence. PRP and MSCs are used autogenously to help facilitate the healing process, and their injection has been studied in the long-term management of discogenic low back pain. PRP has been compared to steroid injections in the sacroiliac joint for chronic low back pain, with favorable results. MSCs have also been shown to be useful in intervertebral disc regeneration and treatment of chronic low back pain associated with degenerative disc disease. Currently, the price for these treatments is extremely high, and thus the standard of care continues to be steroid injections and other treatments. This could change, however, with more robust data and research on the safety and long-term efficacy of biologics compared to other interventional management.",0.9984737038612366
18,2019,35238421,Can electrical stimulation devices treat male urinary incontinence?,electrical stimulation male urinary incontinence,0.0,"Introduction and objective: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most common degenerative neurologic disease worldwide. Overactive bladder (OAB) is prevalent in this population but can be challenging to treat. Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is an attractive option but remains understudied. We have utilized SNM in PD patients and herein describe our outcomes. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of PD patients who underwent peripheral nerve evaluation (PNE) or Stage 1 SNM from 2000 to 2020. The primary outcome was progression to a permanent implant. The impact of PD stage and preprocedural urodynamic (UDS) parameters on test-phase outcome were investigated. Long-term efficacy was assessed using Wilcoxon matched-pairs test looking at a change in urinary symptoms (frequency, nocturia, incontinence episodes, and pad use) documented at follow-up visits and further need for treatment. Results: Thirty-four patients underwent test phase SNM (7 PNE and 27 Stage 1). Median follow-up was 11 (interquartile range 5.8-29.8) months. Indications included refractory OAB (30/34) and nonobstructive urinary retention (4/34). Overall, 82% (28/34) of patients proceeded to a permanent implant. 71% (5/7) of PNEs were successful. Test-phase success did not differ based on PD disease severity or UDS parameters. In patients with OAB/urgency incontinence who progressed to the permanent implant, there was a statistically significant improvement in their urinary symptoms from baseline. Most (68%) patients were able to discontinue OAB medications post-implant. The overall lead revision rate was 14% (4/28) and 3 devices required removal. Conclusions: SNM is an efficacious treatment option for PD patients with a high percentage of patients having improvement in their urinary symptoms.",0.9998732805252075

A pivotal trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this investigational device, eCoin®, for treating refractory urgency urinary incontinence. Materials and methods: This was a prospective, open-label, single arm trial carried out at 15 U.S. medical centers involving 137 subjects with refractory urgency urinary incontinence. After implantation in the lower leg above the fascia over the tibial nerve, eCoin delivered automated stimulation sessions for the duration of the study. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of subjects who achieved a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in urgency urinary incontinence episodes after 48 weeks of therapy. The primary safety measure was device-related adverse events at the same time point. Results: Of 137 subjects enrolled, 133 were implanted with eCoin, and 132 were included in the intention-to-treat population. Of those 132 subjects, 98% were female, mean±SD age was 63.9±10.9 years, and baseline daily urgency urinary incontinence episodes were 4.3±3.1. The primary efficacy analysis showed 68% (95% CI: 60%-76%) of subjects experienced at least a 50% reduction in urgency urinary incontinence episodes at 48 weeks post-activation; 16% of implanted subjects experienced device-related events through 52 weeks post-implantation.

18,2019,33691669,Can electrical stimulation devices treat male urinary incontinence?,electrical stimulation male urinary incontinence,0.0,"Background: Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) has become an effective therapy for patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) who do not respond to conservative treatment. However, an effective treatment strategy for patients who fail SNM has not yet been identified. An option for LUTD is needed when the clinical response to the SNM diminishes. Case presentation: A 51-year-old Chinese man presented to an outpatient clinic complaining of difficulty in urination for &gt; 3 years. The patient also complained of urinary frequency and urgency, accompanied by perineal discomfort. He was diagnosed with LUTD based on his symptoms and previous examinations. The patient underwent sacral neuromodulation with a permanent implantable pulse generator (IPG) (provided free of charge by Chengnuo Medical Technology Co., Ltd.; General Stim, Hangzhou, China) in the left buttock, as he participated in the company's clinical trial to test the long-term effects of IPG. He reported loss of efficacy of the device 3 months after the implantation. We performed bilateral electrical pudendal nerve stimulation (EPNS) therapy for him. After 2 weeks of treatment, he began to report smooth voiding within 2 h after EPNS, and a moderate improvement in urinary frequency, urgency, and perineal discomfort. After 4 weeks of EPNS, the patient reported &gt; 50% improvement in his urination, evaluated with the short form of the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire for Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms. He reported smooth voiding, moderate improvements in urinary frequency and urgency, and the disappearance of the perineal discomfort. He also reported improved sleep and erections. The patient was discharged after 8 weeks of EPNS treatment. Conclusion: EPNS could be an option as an additional therapy for patients with LUTD who have failed SNM.",0.9998574256896973

The Axonics® System is a miniaturized, rechargeable SNM system designed to provide therapy for at least 15 years, which is expected to significantly reduce revision surgeries as it will not require replacement as frequently as the non-rechargeable SNM system. The ARTISAN-SNM study is a pivotal study designed to treat patients with urinary urgency incontinence (UUI). Clinical results at 1-year are presented. Methods: A total of 129 eligible UUI patients were treated. All participants were implanted with a quadripolar tined lead and neurostimulator in a single procedure. Efficacy data were collected using a 3-day bladder diary, a validated quality of life questionnaire (ICIQ-OABqol), and a participant satisfaction questionnaire. Therapy responders were defined as participants with ≥50% reduction in UUI episodes compared to baseline. Data were analyzed on all 129 participants. Results: At 1 year, 89% of the participants were therapy responders. The average UUI episodes per day reduced from 5.6 ± 0.3 at baseline to 1.4 ± 0.2. Participants experienced an overall clinically meaningful improvement of 34 points on the ICIQ-OABqol questionnaire. All study participants (100%) were able to recharge their device at 1 year, and 96% of participants reported that the frequency and duration of recharging was acceptable. There were no serious device-related adverse events.

18,2019,31909689,Can electrical stimulation devices treat male urinary incontinence?,electrical stimulation male urinary incontinence,0.0,"Purpose: One risk of removal of a tined sacral neuromodulation lead is breakage, resulting in a retained lead fragment. We report lead breakage rates, risk factors and outcomes of retained fragments. Materials and methods: We report on 464 tined lead removals from 2002 to 2018. Clinical and surgical factors were reviewed and appropriate statistical analysis performed. Retained fragments were reviewed for fragment description and long-term complications. Results: A total of 464 tined lead removals were included, with 35 lead breaks identified, for a rate of 7.5% (35). Factors associated with breakage included male gender (OR 6.58, 95% CI 2.54-17.01, p=0.001) and diabetes (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.05-5.58, p=0.019). A shorter time since implantation was protective (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.98, p=0.002). There was no difference in breakage rate based on age, weight, history of prior revision, bilateral leads, reason for lead removal, surgical technique or surgeon. Of the 35 breaks 27 had imaging available. Of these 66% (18) broke in the tined region and 81% (22) were ghost leads. Most patients (80%, 28 of 35) with retained lead fragments received another implant. Only 1 patient had a related complication of additional surgery for pain related to the fragment. Conclusions: There is a low rate of tined lead breakage during lead removal. However, it is higher than the manufacturer estimate. Protective factors include a shorter time between implant and lead revision. The most common location for lead breakage is in the region of the tines, most are ghost fragments and long-term complications are uncommon.",0.9994481205940247

The study was performed in 2 groups (n = 16) of rats: OVChit - after excision of a fragment of the sciatic nerve, a chitosan conduit was implanted; OVChitE10 group - additionally to chitosan conduit, shape-memory terpolymer rods based on poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide- co-trimethylene carbonate) releasing 17-β-estradiol for 20 weeks were implanted. The mean number of regenerating axons and mean fiber area were significantly greater in 17-β-estradiol-treated animals. In this group, the infiltrate of leukocytes was diminished. The presence of 17-β-estradiol receptors alpha and beta in motoneurons in the spinal cord were discovered. This may indicate the location where 17-β-estradiol affects the regeneration of the injured nerve. Estradiol released from the terpolymer rods for 20 weeks could enhance, to some extent, sciatic nerve regeneration after injury, and diminish the inflammatory reaction. In the future, 17-β-estradiol entrapped in terpolymer rods could be used in the repair of injured peripheral nerves, but there is a need for further studies.",0.21380332112312317

The animals were randomly divided into 6 groups: sham-operated (SO; n=24), SNI (reference group; n=20), and 4 experimental SNI groups intrathecally treated with dexamethasone (DEX; GR agonist; n=20), RU38486 (GR antagonist; n=20), ZD7288 (HCN channels blocker; n=20), and ZD7288+DEX (n=20). The paw mechanical withdrawal threshold (PWT) was measured one day before surgery (SO group) and on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after surgery. Behavioral results showed that mechanical hyperalgesia appeared on day 1 after SNI, while PWT decreased gradually with time. The expression of GR and HCN4 channels in L4-L6 dorsal horn of the spinal cord was detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. In the reference group, SNI significantly increased GR expression up to day 14 after surgery in comparison with the SO group. The expression of GR showed a tendency to increase in the DEX group (with the maximum expression on days 14 and 21), significantly increased in the RU38486 group (maximum on day 7). In the ZD7288 group, GR expression was lower than in the SNI group and did not change throughout the experiment, suggesting that ZD7288 could block the expression of GR. In the DEX group, the expression of HCN4 channels was significantly higher on day 1 after SNI, but there were no differences in this parameter between the RU38486 and ZD7288 groups. In the ZD7288+DEX group, the expression of HCN4 channels significantly increased on days 14 and 21 after SNI. Thus, GR and HCN4 have the same linkage in the formation of central sensitization after SNI, but antagonists have no significant effect on the improvement of pain behavior.",0.0012907534837722778
20,2019,36204385,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating disease with limited effective treatment options. Animal paradigms are vital for understanding the pathogenesis of SCI and testing potential therapeutics. The porcine model of SCI is increasingly favored because of its greater similarity to humans. However, its adoption is limited by the complexities of care and range of testing parameters. Researchers need to consider swine selection, injury method, post-operative care, rehabilitation, behavioral outcomes, and histology metrics. Therefore, we systematically reviewed full-text English-language articles to evaluate study characteristics used in developing a porcine model and summarize the interventions that have been tested using this paradigm. A total of 63 studies were included, with 33 examining SCI pathogenesis and 30 testing interventions. Studies had an average sample size of 15 pigs with an average weight of 26 kg, and most used female swine with injury to the thoracic cord. Injury was most commonly induced by weight drop with compression. The porcine model is amenable to testing various interventions, including mean arterial pressure augmentation ( n = 7), electrical stimulation ( n = 6), stem cell therapy ( n = 5), hypothermia ( n = 2), biomaterials ( n = 2), gene therapy ( n = 2), steroids ( n = 1), and nanoparticles ( n = 1).

We will determine if testosterone treatment (TT)+LPWS would increase skeletal muscle size, leg lean mass and improve overall metabolic health in persons with SCI with denervation. We hypothesise that the 1-year TT+LPWS will upregulate protein synthesis pathways, downregulate protein degradation pathways and increase overall mitochondrial health. Methods and analysis: Twenty-four male participants (aged 18-70 years with chronic SCI) with denervation of both knee extensor muscles and tolerance to the LPWS paradigm will be randomised into either TT+neuromuscular electrical stimulation via telehealth or TT+LPWS. The training sessions will be twice weekly for 1 year. Measurements will be conducted 1 week prior training (baseline; week 0), 6 months following training (postintervention 1) and 1 week after the end of 1 year of training (postintervention 2). Measurements will include body composition assessment using anthropometry, dual X-ray absorptiometry and MRI to measure size of different muscle groups. Metabolic profile will include measuring of basal metabolic rate, followed by blood drawn to measure fasting biomarkers similar to hemoglobin A1c, lipid panels, C reactive protein, interleukin-6 and free fatty acids and then intravenous glucose tolerance test to test for insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness. Finally, muscle biopsy will be captured to measure protein expression and intracellular signalling; and mitochondrial electron transport chain function.

20,2019,36147469,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,"Demyelination due to oligodendrocytes loss occurs after traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI). Several studies have suggested the therapeutic potential of vitamin D (VitD) in demyelinating diseases. However, experimental evidence in the context of TSCI is limited, particularly in the presence of prior VitD-deficiency. In the present study, a contusion and a transection TSCI rat model were used, representing mild and severe injury, respectively. Motor recovery was assessed in rats with normal VitD level or with VitD-deficiency after 8 weeks' treatment post-TSCI (Cholecalciferol, 500 IU/kg/day). The impact on myelin integrity was examined by transmission electron microscopy and studied in vitro using primary culture of oligodendrocytes. We found that VitD treatment post-TSCI effectively improved hindlimb movement in rats with normal VitD level irrespective of injury severity. However, cord-transected rats with prior deficiency did not seem to benefit from VitD supplementation. Our data further suggested that having sufficient VitD was essential for persevering myelin integrity after injury. VitD rescued oligodendrocytes from apoptotic cell death in vitro and enhanced their myelinating ability towards dorsal root axons. Enhanced myelination was mediated by increased oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) differentiation into oligodendrocytes in concert with c-Myc downregulation and suppressed OPCs proliferation. Our study provides novel insights into the functioning of VitD as a regulator of OPCs differentiation as well as strong preclinical evidence supporting future clinical testing of VitD for TSCI.",0.0014314805157482624

However, serious neurological complications may occur during CIESI because of direct nerve damage following inappropriate needle placement. Case report : A 35-year-old woman presented with posterior neck pain radiating to the left upper arm. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left C6 nerve impingement. CIESI under fluoroscopic guidance was performed at another hospital using the left C5/6 interlaminar approach. Immediately after the procedure, the patient experienced dizziness, decreased blood pressure, motor weakness in the left upper arm, and sensory loss. She visited our emergency department with postdural puncture headache (PDPH) that worsened after the procedure. Post-admission cervical MRI revealed intramedullary T2 high signal intensity and cord swelling from the C4/5 to C6/7 levels; thus, a diagnosis of spinal cord injury was made. The patient's PDPH spontaneously improved after 48 h. However, despite conservative treatment with steroids, the decrease in abduction of the left fifth finger and loss of sensation in the dorsum of the left hand persisted for up to 6 months after the procedure. As noticed in the follow-up MRI performed 6 months post-procedure, the T2 high signal intensity in the left intramedullary region had decreased compared to that observed previously; however, cord swelling persisted. Furthermore, left C7/8 radiculopathy with acute denervation was confirmed by electromyography performed 6 months after the procedure. Conclusions : Fluoroscopy does not guarantee the prevention of spinal cord penetration during CIESI. Moreover, persistent neurological deficits may occur, particularly due to intrathecal perforation or drug administration during CIESI. Therefore, in accordance with the recommendations of the Multisociety Pain Workgroup, we recommend performing CIESI at the C6/7 or C7/T1 levels, where the epidural space is relatively large, rather than at the C5/6 level or higher.",0.9998947381973267

Objectives: To examine current international practices as well as knowledge, adoption, and barriers to guideline implementation for acute spinal cord injury (SCI) management. Methods: A survey was distributed to members of AO Spine. The questionnaire was structured to obtain demographic data and preferred acute SCI practices surrounding steroid use, hemodynamic management, and timing of surgical decompression. Results: 593 members completed the survey including orthopaedic surgeons (54.3%), neurosurgeons (35.6%), and traumatologists (8.4%). Most (61.2%) respondents were from low and middle-income countries (LMICs). 53.6% of physicians used steroids for the treatment of acute SCIs. Respondents from LMICs were more likely to administer steroids than HICs (178 vs. 78; P .001). 331 respondents (81.5%) answered that patients would receive mean arterial pressure (MAP) targeted treatment. In LMICs, SCI patients were less likely to be provided with MAP-targeted treatment (76.9%) as compared to HICs (89%; P .05). The majority of respondents (87.8%) reported that patients would benefit from early decompression. Despite overwhelming evidence and surgeons' responses that would offer early surgery, 62.4% of respondents stated they encounter logistical barriers in their institutions. This was particularly evident in LMICs, where 57.9% of respondents indicated that early intervention was unlikely to be accomplished, while only 21.1% of respondents from HICs stated the same ( P .001). Conclusion: This survey highlights challenges in the implementation of standardized global practices in the management of acute SCI.

Systemic administration of methylprednisolone (MP) at a higher dosage though can reduce neurological deficits following acute SCI. Still, this treatment regimen is controversial, owing to the apparent dose-related side effects and relatively minor improvement in neurological function. Therefore, this study aimed at the bibliometric analysis of published literature related to SCI treatment, which may lead to future research trends. Methods: The literature published relating to SCI and using glucocorticoids for its treatment between 1982 and 2022 was collected and scanned in the Web of Science collection database using the keywords glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, MP, corticosteroids, and SCI, followed by using VOSviewer for bibliometric analysis of these articles. Results: A total of 1,848 published articles and 7,448 authors on SCI and glucocorticoid usage were identified. The SCI total link strength accounts for 1,341, and MP for 762 has a strong link to neuroprotection and inflammation. The mean citation count for the top 20 most-cited articles was 682 (range: 358-1,828), where most of these were descriptive studies having focused on clinical features. The Journal of Neurotrauma was the highest-ranked journal with 6,010 citations. A total of 69 articles were published by Michael G Fehlings from the University of Toronto with 6,092 citations. The University of Toronto has published 90-related manuscripts with 7,632 citations. In contrast, 800 articles were published in the United States, with 39,633 citations and total link strength of 5,714. The second-ranked country was China, with 241 published articles and 3,403 citations. Conclusions: The research published on applying MP in treating SCI has increased with time. Although the United States has made a significant global contribution to this important field of research, it requires rigorous clinical trials designed to verify the therapeutic role of MP in SCI and its appropriate dosage to find solutions for neurological recovery.",0.039027851074934006
20,2019,35908138,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,"Background: Achondroplasia is the commonest skeletal dysplasia of autosomal dominant inheritance caused by ""gain of function"" mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Foramen magnum compression due to accelerated ossification and spinal canal stenosis secondary to reduced interpedicular distance is a hallmark of achondroplasia, driven by G380R nucleotide pair substitution. In severe cases, limb weakness and neurogenic claudication will require surgical decompression. Rarely, a neurological condition may mimic the compressive spinal dysfunction and therefore, non-surgical causes must also be considered in cases of acute neurological deterioration in children with achondroplasia. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune condition resulting in fatigable muscle weakness. There are no reported cases of myasthenia gravis in achondroplasia in the literature. Results: We report a child with achondroplasia scheduled for decompressive surgery for severe lumbar canal stenosis presenting with neurological claudication and knee weakness. While waiting for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, she developed generalized fatigability and severe weakness raising concerns of acute worsening of cord compression. Urgent investigations ruled out spinal cord compression but identified an unexpected concurrent myasthenia gravis with positive antibodies to acetylcholine receptors. The surgical intervention was postponed averting the potential risk of life-threatening anaesthetic complications. She was successfully managed with a combination of pyridostigmine, steroids, azathioprine, and plasma exchange. Conclusion: We report the first case of myasthenia gravis in achondroplasia and review implications in the management.",0.9998179078102112
27,2019,34460825,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,"Background: Delayed (or ""backup"") antibiotic prescription, where the patient is given a prescription but advised to delay initiating antibiotics, has been shown to be effective in reducing antibiotic use in primary care. However, this strategy is not widely used in the United Kingdom. This study aimed to identify factors influencing preferences among the UK public for delayed prescription, and understand their relative importance, to help increase appropriate use of this prescribing option. Methods and findings: We conducted an online choice experiment in 2 UK general population samples: adults and parents of children under 18 years. Respondents were presented with 12 scenarios in which they, or their child, might need antibiotics for a respiratory tract infection (RTI) and asked to choose either an immediate or a delayed prescription. Scenarios were described by 7 attributes. Data were collected between November 2018 and February 2019. Respondent preferences were modelled using mixed-effects logistic regression. The survey was completed by 802 adults and 801 parents (75% of those who opened the survey). The samples reflected the UK population in age, sex, ethnicity, and country of residence. The most important determinant of respondent choice was symptom severity, especially for cough-related symptoms. In the adult sample, the probability of choosing delayed prescription was 0.53 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.56, p 0.001) for a chesty cough and runny nose compared to 0.30 (0.28 to 0.33, p 0.001) for a chesty cough with fever, 0.47 (0.44 to 0.50, p 0.001) for sore throat with swollen glands, and 0.37 (0.34 to 0.39, p 0.001) for sore throat, swollen glands, and fever. Respondents were less likely to choose delayed prescription with increasing duration of illness (odds ratio (OR) 0.94 (0.92 to 0.96, p 0.001)). Probabilities of choosing delayed prescription were similar for parents considering treatment for a child (44% of choices versus 42% for adults, p = 0.04). However, parents differed from the adult sample in showing a more marked reduction in choice of the delayed prescription with increasing duration of illness (OR 0.83 (0.80 to 0.87) versus 0.94 (0.92 to 0.96) for adults, p for heterogeneity p 0.001) and a smaller effect of disruption of usual activities (OR 0.96 (0.95 to 0.97) versus 0.93 (0.92 to 0.94) for adults, p for heterogeneity p 0.001). Females were more likely to choose a delayed prescription than males for minor symptoms, particularly minor cough (probability 0.62 (0.58 to 0.66, p 0.001) for females and 0.45 (0.41 to 0.48, p 0.001) for males). Older people, those with a good understanding of antibiotics, and those who had not used antibiotics recently showed similar patterns of preferences. Study limitations include its hypothetical nature, which may not reflect real-life behaviour; the absence of a ""no prescription"" option; and the possibility that study respondents may not represent the views of population groups who are typically underrepresented in online surveys. Conclusions: This study found that delayed prescription appears to be an acceptable approach to reducing antibiotic consumption. Certain groups appear to be more amenable to delayed prescription, suggesting particular opportunities for increased use of this strategy. Prescribing choices for sore throat may need additional explanation to ensure patient acceptance, and parents in particular may benefit from reassurance about the usual duration of these illnesses.",0.9997861981391907

Limited information in this field is available and the management is based on expert opinion. Patient concerns: An 8-year-old girl admitted for 7 days history of wet cough, purulent fetid sputum, shortness of breath and low-grade fever. The wet cough has presented for the past 4 years, during which she had frequent hospitalization for recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. Diagnosis: Chest high-resolution computerized tomography revealed diffuse bronchial dilations accompanied by inflammation in the bilateral lung fields. Microbiologic investigation for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interventions: With a working diagnosis of bronchiectasis with secondary pulmonary infection, sensitive cefoperazone-sulbactam was administrated for 14 days with gradual improvement of clinical symptoms. Bronchoscopy washing substantially soothed the symptoms, reducing the cough and sputum volumes. Outcomes: The child was discharged after 14 days, and treated on long-term prophylactic antibiotic use (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 20 mg/kg/d, ≥ 4 weeks). Lessons: Although bronchiectasisis are condition in childhood, the diagnosis is suspected in children with persistent wet or productive cough, and should be confirmed by a chest high-resolution computerized tomography scan. Antibiotics and airway clearance techniques represent the milestones of bronchiectasis management although there are only a few guidelines in children.",0.9987751841545105

The objective of this article is to collate the pediatric components of the CHEST chronic cough guidelines that have recently updated the 2006 guidelines to assist general and specialist medical practitioners in the evaluation and management of children who present with chronic cough. Methods: We reviewed all current CHEST Expert Cough Panel's statements and extracted recommendations and suggestions relating to children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (&gt; 4 weeks duration). Additionally, we undertook systematic reviews to update other sections we considered relevant and important. Results: The eight recent CHEST guidelines relevant to children, based on systematic reviews, reported some high-quality evidence in the management of chronic cough in children (eg, use of algorithms and management of wet/productive cough using appropriate antibiotics). However, much evidence is still inadequate, particularly in the management of non-specific cough in the community. Conclusions: The recommendations and suggestions related to the management of chronic cough in the pediatric age group have been based upon high-quality systematic reviews and are summarized in this article. Compared to the 2006 Cough Guidelines, there is now high-quality evidence for some aspects of the management of chronic cough in children.

Past history, cough duration, and cough characteristics significantly affected treatment decisions. Children with cough frequently had a history of preterm birth, allergies, asthma, and neurological conditions. Most common therapies were bronchodilators, antibiotics, and oral corticosteroids. Children prescribed antibiotics were older, more likely to have a wet or productive cough, history of sinusitis, pneumonia or dysphagia, and longer cough duration. Children prescribed oral corticosteroids were younger, less likely to be wet or productive and more likely to have history of asthma or dysphagia.

This often has an infectious aetiology which is usually a self-limiting viral infection requiring no investigation or treatment. In those with acute wet cough it is, however, important to identify features suggestive of community acquired pneumonia or an inhaled foreign body as these causes require specific management. When there is chronic wet cough, the most common diagnoses are protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and bronchiectasis. The relationship between these two conditions is complex as the development of bronchiectasis manifests as a clinical continuum in which the early features of which are indistinguishable from PBB. It is therefore important to identify PBB and chronic cough endotypes which are associated with an increased risk of bronchiectasis. This article offers a pragmatic approach to the investigation and treatment of children with wet cough. It is hoped this will limit unnecessary investigations whist aiding the prompt diagnosis of conditions needing treatment to reduce symptom burden and prevent further lung damage.",0.9998182654380798
27,2019,30580451,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,"Aim: In 2017, the European Respiratory Society task force stated that protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) was a distinct clinical entity and outlined the diagnostic criteria and principles for treatment. However, this guidance was based on data from Australia and the USA. This mini review evaluated the data and addressed the lack of research-based data from Europe. Methods: We supplemented the 2017 report by conducting a nonsystematic review of the literature on prolonged wet or productive cough and on PBB in children up to September 2018. Results: Our review confirmed the lack of European data on PBB. Based on the available literature, and the 2017 European guidance, PBB is a wet or productive cough that lasts for four or more weeks, with no signs or symptoms, known as specific cough pointers, which suggest an underlying illness. PBB usually recovers with appropriate antibiotics for two weeks. Failing that radiological investigations or lung function measurements are needed. If PBB occurs three times over 12 months, then computerised tomography can diagnose bronchiectasis and determine other permanent changes. Conclusion: More data are needed on PBB, especially in Europe. The implementation of PBB may help clinicians to prescribe antibiotics more effectively and reduce their inappropriate use.",0.9996784925460815
27,2019,30500093,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,"Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung disease associated with structurally abnormal bronchi, clinically manifested by a persistent wet/productive cough, airway infections and recurrent exacerbations. Early identification and treatment of acute exacerbations is an integral part of monitoring and annual review, in both adults and children, to minimize further damage due to infection and inflammation. Common modalities used to monitor disease progression include clinical signs and symptoms, frequency of exacerbations and/or number of hospital admissions, lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 )% predicted), imaging (radiological severity of disease) and sputum microbiology (chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa). There is good evidence that these monitoring tools can be used to accurately assess severity of disease and predict prognosis in terms of mortality and future hospitalization. Other tools that are currently used in research settings such as health-related quality of life (QoL) questionnaires, magnetic resonance imaging and lung clearance index can be burdensome and require additional expertise or resource, which limits their use in clinical practice. Studies have demonstrated that cross-infection, especially with P. aeruginosa between patients with bronchiectasis is possible but infrequent. This should not limit participation of patients in group activities such as pulmonary rehabilitation, and simple infection control measures should be carried out to limit the risk of cross-transmission. A multidisciplinary approach to care which includes respiratory physicians, chest physiotherapists, nurse specialists and other allied health professionals are vital in providing holistic care. Patient education and personalized self-management plans are also important despite limited evidence it improves QoL or frequency of exacerbations.",0.9997263550758362
27,2019,30062732,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,"Background: Cough is a frequent symptom presenting to doctors. The most common cause of childhood chronic (greater than fours weeks' duration) wet cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in some settings, although other more serious causes can also present this way. Timely and effective management of chronic wet or productive cough improves quality of life and clinical outcomes. Current international guidelines suggest a course of antibiotics is the first treatment of choice in the absence of signs or symptoms specific to an alternative diagnosis. This review sought to clarify the current evidence to support this recommendation. Objectives: To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with prolonged wet cough (excluding children with bronchiectasis or other known underlying respiratory illness) and to assess risk of harm due to adverse events. Search methods: We undertook an updated search (from 2008 onwards) using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, trials registries, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest searches were performed in September 2017. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic wet cough. We excluded cluster and cross-over trials. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane. We reviewed results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two independent review authors selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors of eligible studies for further information as needed. We analysed data as 'intention to treat.' Main results: We identified three studies as eligible for inclusion in the review. Two were in the previous review and one new study was included. We considered the older studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias whereas we judged the newly included study at low risk of bias. The studies varied in treatment duration (from 7 to 14 days) and the antibiotic used (two studies used amoxicillin/clavulanate acid and one used erythromycin).We included 190 children (171 completed), mean ages ranged from 21 months to six years, in the meta-analyses. Analysis of all three trials (190 children) found that treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31, using intention-to -treat analysis), which translated to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). We identified no significant heterogeneity (for both fixed-effect and random-effects model the I² statistic was 0%). Two older trials assessed progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics (125 children), which was significantly lower in the antibiotic group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.34; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). All three trials (190 children) reported adverse events, which were not significantly increased in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.69). We assessed the quality of evidence GRADE rating as moderate for all outcome measures, except adverse events which we assessed as low quality. Authors' conclusions: Evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious for the treatment of children with chronic wet cough (greater than four weeks) with an NNTB of three. However, antibiotics have adverse effects and this review reported only uncertainty as to the risk of increased adverse effects when they were used in this setting. The inclusion of a more robust study strengthened the previous Cochrane review and its results.",0.9998692274093628

We formulated recommendations based on systematic reviews related to the management of chronic wet cough in children (aged ≤ 14 years) based on two key questions: (1) how effective are antibiotics in improving the resolution of cough? If so, what antibiotic should be used and for how long? and (2) when should children be referred for further investigations? Methods: We used the CHEST expert cough panel's protocol for systematic reviews and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and GRADE framework (the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus for the recommendations/suggestions made. Results: Combining data from the systematic reviews, we found high-quality evidence in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (&gt; 4 weeks' duration) wet/productive cough that using appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution, and further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be undertaken when specific cough pointers (eg, digital clubbing) are present. When the wet cough does not improve following 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, there is moderate-quality evidence that further investigations should be considered to look for an underlying disease. New recommendations include the recognition of the clinical diagnostic entity of protracted bacterial bronchitis. Conclusions: Compared with the 2006 Cough Guidelines, there is now high-quality evidence for some, but not all, aspects of the management of chronic wet cough in specialist settings.

However, in children unable to expectorate, cough may instead be wet and intermittent and bronchial dilatation reversible in the early stages. Although still considered an orphan disease, it is being recognized increasingly as causing significant morbidity and mortality in children and adults in both affluent and developing countries. While bronchiectasis has multiple etiologies, the final common pathway involves a complex interplay between the host, respiratory pathogens and environmental factors. These interactions lead to a vicious cycle of repeated infections, airway inflammation and tissue remodelling resulting in impaired airway clearance, destruction of structural elements within the bronchial wall causing them to become dilated and small airway obstruction. In this review, the current knowledge of the epidemiology, pathobiology, clinical features, and management of bronchiectasis in children are summarized. Recent evidence has emerged to improve our understanding of this heterogeneous disease including the role of viruses, and how antibiotics, novel drugs, antiviral agents, and vaccines might be used. Importantly, the management is no longer dependent upon extrapolating from the cystic fibrosis experience. Nevertheless, substantial information gaps remain in determining the underlying disease mechanisms that initiate and sustain the pathophysiological pathways leading to bronchiectasis. National and international collaborations, standardizing definitions of clinical and research end points, and exploring novel primary prevention strategies are needed if further progress is to be made in understanding, treating and even preventing this often life-limiting disease.",0.9997476935386658

The characteristic symptom is severe, long-lasting paroxysmal coughing. Especially in newborns and infants, pertussis symptoms, such as leukocytosis, can become life-threatening. Despite an available vaccination, increasing case numbers have been reported worldwide, including Western countries such as Germany and the USA. Antibiotic treatment is available and important to prevent further transmission. However, antibiotics only reduce symptoms if administered in early stages, which rarely occurs due to a late diagnosis. Thus, no causative treatments against symptoms of whooping cough are currently available. The AB-type protein toxin PT is a main virulence factor and consists of a binding subunit that facilitates transport of an enzyme subunit into the cytosol of target cells. There, the enzyme subunit ADP-ribosylates inhibitory α-subunits of G-protein coupled receptors resulting in disturbed cAMP signaling. As an important virulence factor associated with severe symptoms, such as leukocytosis, and poor outcomes, PT represents an attractive drug target to develop novel therapeutic strategies. In this review, chaperone inhibitors, human peptides, small molecule inhibitors, and humanized antibodies are discussed as novel strategies to inhibit PT.",0.9998323917388916

Methods: Susceptibilities of B. pertussis clinical isolates to erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin were determined by epsilometer test (E-test). Isolated strains were sequenced to ascertain the presence of the 23S rRNA gene A2047G mutation. Strains were typed using multilocus antigen sequence typing, multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: Of 58 B. pertussis strains isolated in this study, 46 were macrolide-resistant and 12 were macrolide sensitive. All macrolide-resistant strains carried the A2047G mutation and were the prn1 / ptxP1 / ptxA1 / fim3-1 / fim2-1 genotype; the MLVA types were MT195 (19/58), MT55 (13/58) and MT104 (14/58), and the PFGE profiles were classified into BpSR23 (17/58) and BpFINR9 (29/58) types. None of the macrolide-sensitive strains carried the A2047G mutation; genotypes were ( prn9 or prn2 )/ ptxP3 / ptxA1 / fim3-1 / fim2-1 , and all were MT27. PFGE profiles differed from the macrolide-resistant strains. Conclusions: B. pertussis clinical isolates from western China were severely resistant to macrolides.

It is one of the most common causes of death in childhood. It is also a frequent cause of chronic cough in children, adolescents, and adults. Methods: Global and Hong Kong perspectives of childhood pertussis were described. Results: Hong Kong has prided herself in the city's childhood immunization program. There appear to be no major outbreaks of pertussis since the 1960s. Nevertheless, pediatricians may see isolated cases of pertussis or pertussis-like cases from time to time. Occasionally, infants are severely affected with apneas and managed with ventilator supports in the PICU. Outbreaks of the notifiable disease continue to occur despite a reasonable surveillance system and vaccination program in Hong Kong. Vaccination of mothers, adolescents, and adults are efficacious methods to further reduce the risks of pertussis. Macrolides remain efficacious antibiotics especially used early during the infectious phase. Infants with pertussis may require intensive care support and morbidity is high.

Methods This single-center, retrospective cohort study examined the effects of the early administration of macrolides and antitussive agents on cough secondary to pertussis. We divided the patients into two groups based on the median duration from the beginning of the cough to the initiation of macrolide administration: early macrolide administration group (EMAG) and non-early macrolide administration group (NEMAG). The clinical improvement of cough was defined as maintaining a cough awareness score of ≤3 points for 3 consecutive days. Patients The medical records of 40 patients diagnosed with pertussis (≥12 years old) who were able to maintain a cough diary and received no other antibiotics aside from macrolides were included in the study. A diagnosis of pertussis was made using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test. Results The EMAG (24 patients) showed a significantly shorter total cough period than the NEMAG [16 patients; 20.0 (95% confidence interval (CI), 16-28) vs. 30.5 (95% CI, 27-40) days; log-rank test, p=0.002]. There was no significant difference in the post-administration cough periods between the EMAG and NEMAG [11.0 (95% CI, 7-19) vs. 13.0 (95% CI, 5-23) days; log-rank test, p=0.232]. Antitussive agents did not affect the cough. Conclusion The early administration of macrolides, but not antitussive agents, is effective for treating pertussis. Therefore, macrolides should be administered as soon as possible for this disease.",0.9998990297317505

A chest X-ray showed right atrial dilatation and an echocardiogram was scheduled outpatient. However, after re-presenting with worsening cough and dyspnoea, an inpatient echocardiogram was performed which suggested elevated pulmonary pressures with significant tricuspid regurgitation, as confirmed by subsequent cardiac catheterisation. She had an elective caesarean section at 34 weeks and underwent repeat right heart catheterisation which revealed persistent, and likely pre-existing, pulmonary arterial hypertension. This case highlights the importance of thorough assessment of non-obstetric symptoms in pregnancy in formulating alternative differentials, even after a diagnosis has been made, to prevent potentially life-threatening conditions from being missed.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out between January 2018 and March 2019. Data recording forms were filled by the face to face interview method. Anti-pertussis toxin IgG (Anti-PT IgG) antibody levels were determined quantitatively from the serum samples using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Anti-PT IgG results were interpreted according to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Results: Of the 169 HCWs included in the study, 67 (39.6%) were seronegative and susceptible to pertussis. Seropositivity was significantly higher among HCWs who worked 40-80 hours per week. Thirty-six (21.3%) HCWs had high anti-PT IgG levels, indicating recent infection in the past few years. High-level positivity was significantly more common among HCWs using macrolide antibiotics due to prolonged cough. Anti-PT IgG levels of three (1.8%) were compatible with acute infection and they were not followed up with suspicion of whooping cough and were not isolated. While 125 (74.0%) of the participants said they could get the pertussis vaccine booster dose, only three (1.8%) had done so. Conclusions: The fact that 39.6% of HCWs were seronegative, emphasized the need for the pertussis booster dose. More than 20% of HCWs have had the acute infection without pertussis diagnosis in the past few years. Adult vaccination awareness in HCWs has not yet created a change in behavior. The high rate of seropositivity in macrolide users also shows that we cannot prevent its spread despite treatment.

Pertussis infects an estimated 24 million people annually, resulting in &gt;150,000 deaths. The NIH placed pertussis on the list of emerging pathogens in 2015. Antibiotics are ineffective unless administered before the onset of the disease characteristic cough. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel pertussis therapeutics. We have shown that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) agonists reduce pertussis inflammation without increasing bacterial burden. Transcriptomic studies were performed to identify this mechanism and allow for the development of pertussis therapeutics that specifically target problematic inflammation without sacrificing bacterial control. These data suggested a role for triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1). TREM-1 cell surface receptor functions as an amplifier of inflammatory responses. Expression of TREM-1 is increased in response to bacterial infection of mucosal surfaces. In mice, B. pertussis infection results in Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-dependent increased expression of TREM-1 and its associated cytokines. Interestingly, S1PR agonists dampen pulmonary inflammation and TREM-1 expression. Mice challenged intranasally with B. pertussis and treated with ligand-dependent (LP17) and ligand-independent (GF9) TREM-1 inhibitors showed no differences in bacterial burden and significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL-2) expression compared to controls. Mice receiving TREM-1 inhibitors showed reduced pulmonary inflammation compared to controls, indicating that TREM-1 promotes inflammatory pathology, but not bacterial control, during pertussis infection. This implicates TREM-1 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pertussis.",0.9231648445129395

Baboons are an established model for pertussis research, but like many mammals, they can be naturally infected with Bordetella bronchiseptica. Because B. bronchiseptica interferes with B. pertussis research, it must be excluded from baboons under consideration for enrollment in pertussis studies. In addition to research-related concerns, B. bronchiseptica can sometimes cause clinical disease in baboons and other nonhuman primates. This study examined the use of antibiotics to clear B. bronchiseptica in naturally infected baboons. Thirty-five juvenile baboons were divided into five treatment groups: oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (TMS), nebulized gentamicin (gentamicin), combination (TMS + gentamicin) in positive animals, combination (TMS + gentamicin) as a prophylactic in exposed animals and no treatment (control). Combination of oral TMS and nebulized gentamicin given to positive animals was most effective, producing long-term clearance in 11 out of 12 treated animals. To avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics, our primary management strategy is screening and separating to allow natural clearance and limiting exposure to non-infected animals, but this study investigates an antibiotic regimen that could be used in special circumstances.",0.9994741082191467

29,2019,36109739,Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,antibiotics children pneumonia,1.0,"Background: The first Covid-19 pandemic affected the epidemiology of several diseases. A general reduction in the emergency department (ED) accesses was observed during this period, both in adult and pediatric contexts. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on the behalf of the Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology (SINePe) in 17 Italian pediatric EDs in March and April 2020, comparing them with data from the same periods in 2018 and 2019. The total number of pediatric (age 0-18 years) ED visits, the number of febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnoses, and clinical and laboratory parameters were retrospectively collected. Results: The total number of febrile UTI diagnoses was 339 (73 in 2020, 140 in 2019, and 126 in 2018). During the first Covid-19 pandemic, the total number of ED visits decreased by 75.1%, the total number of febrile UTI diagnoses by 45.1%, with an increase in the UTI diagnosis rate (+ 121.7%). The data collected revealed an increased rate of patients with two or more days of fever before admission (p = 0.02), a significant increase in hospitalization rate (+ 17.5%, p = 0.008) and also in values of C reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.006).

Urine cultures showed higher Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis percentages and lower rates of Escherichia coli (p = 0.02). Conclusions: The first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic had an essential impact on managing febrile UTIs in the ED, causing an absolute reduction of cases referring to the ED but with higher clinical severity. Children with febrile UTI were more severely ill than the previous two years, probably due to delayed access caused by the fear of potential hospital-acquired Sars-Cov-2 infection.

This study aimed to compare shorter and longer Amoxicillin regimens for children with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 5-day and 10-day courses of Amoxicillin for the treatment of CAP in children older than 6 months in an outpatient setting. Studies involving overlapping populations, lower-than-standard antibiotic doses, and hospitalized patients were excluded. The outcome of interest was clinical cure. Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I<sup>2</sup> statistics. Two independent authors conducted the critical appraisal of the included studies according to the RoB-2 tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. We used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) tool to evaluate the certainty of evidence of our results. Three RCTs and 789 children aged from 6 months to 10 years were included, of whom 385 (48.8%) underwent a 5-day regimen. Amoxicillin-based therapy was used in 774 (98%) patients.

Selection of resistant bacteria is driven by inappropriate use of antibiotics, amongst other factors. COVID-19 may have exacerbated AMR due to unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. Country-level knowledge is needed to understand options for action. Objectives: To review the current situation with respect to AMR in India and initiatives addressing it. Identifying areas where more information is required will provide a call to action to minimize further rises in AMR and to improve patient outcomes. Methods: National AMR initiatives, antibiotic use and prescribing in India, and availability of susceptibility data, in particular for the key community-acquired respiratory tract infection (CA-RTI) pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) were identified. National and international antibiotic prescribing guidelines for specific CA-RTIs (community-acquired pneumonia, acute otitis media and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis) commonly used locally were also reviewed, plus local antibiotic availability. Insights from a local clinician and clinical microbiologist were sought to contextualize this information. Conclusions: Many initiatives have been launched since AMR was recognized as a national priority and organizations such as the Indian Academy of Paediatrics and the Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership have worked to build awareness. The Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare published a 5 year national action plan on AMR. However, the burden of infectious disease and consumption of antibiotics in India is high. There have been national surveillance studies generating local data along with international studies such as Survey of Antibiotic Resistance (SOAR) and Antimicrobial Testing Leadership and Surveillance (ATLAS). For common RTIs, clinicians use a range of international and national guidelines. However, a more standardized inclusive approach to developing local guidelines, using up-to-date local surveillance data from community-acquired infections, could make guidelines more locally relevant. This would encourage more appropriate antibiotic prescribing and improve adherence. This would, in turn, potentially limit AMR development and improve patient outcomes.",0.9998446702957153

Methods: We performed a multicenter point prevalence study including children admitted to 10 geographically diverse PICUs over four study days in 2019. Antibiotic orders were reviewed for indication, and appropriateness was assessed using a standardized rubric. Results: Of 1462 patients admitted to participating PICUs, 843 (58%) had at least one antibiotic order. A total of 1277 antibiotic orders were reviewed. Common indications were empiric therapy for suspected bacterial infections without sepsis or septic shock (260 orders, 21%), non-operative prophylaxis (164 orders, 13%), empiric therapy for sepsis or septic shock (155 orders, 12%), community acquired pneumonia (CAP) (118 orders, 9%), and post-operative prophylaxis (94 orders, 8%). Appropriateness was assessed for 985 orders for which an evidence-based rubric for appropriateness could be created. Of these, 331 (34%) were classified as inappropriate.

Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of patients with CAP from 41 United States pediatric hospitals and evaluated clinical outcomes using a composite ordinal severity outcome: mild-discharged (discharged from the emergency department), mild-admitted (hospitalized without other interventions), moderate (provision of intravenous fluids, supplemental oxygen, broadening of antibiotics, complicated pneumonia, and presumed sepsis) or severe (ICU, positive-pressure ventilation, vasoactive infusion, chest drainage, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, severe sepsis, or death). Our primary outcome was potentially unnecessary admissions (ie, mild-admitted). Among mild-discharged and mild-admitted patients, we constructed a generalized linear mixed model for mild-admitted severity and assessed the role of fixed (demographics and clinical testing) and random effects (institution) on this outcome. Results: Of 125 180 children, 68.3% were classified as mild-discharged, 6.6% as mild-admitted, 20.6% as moderate and 4.5% as severe. Among admitted patients (n = 39 692), 8321 (21%) were in the mild-admitted group, with substantial variability in this group across hospitals (median 19.1%, interquartile range 12.8%-28.4%). In generalized linear mixed models comparing mild-admitted and mild-discharge severity groups, hospital had the greatest contribution to model variability compared to all other variables.

Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in 6 tertiary hospitals from January 2016 to December 2018. The basic information, clinical data and the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing were collected from the 98 pediatric inpatients with Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid and analyzed. According to the susceptibility of the infected strains to carbapenems, they were divided into carbapenem-sensitive Acinetobacter baumannii (CSAB) group and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) group. According to the possible sources of infection, they were divided into nosocomial infection group and community infection group. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test were used to analyze categorical variables and rank sum test were used to analyze continuous variables. The risk factors of invasive CRAB infection in children were analyzed by Logistic regression. Result: There were 56 males and 42 females in 98 cases. The onset age of patients was 8 (2, 24) months. There were 62 cases (63%) from rural area. A total of 87 cases (89%) were confirmed with bloodstream infection, and 12 cases (12%) confirmed with meningitis (1 case was accompanied with bloodstream infection).

The proportions of hospitalization in intensive care unit, carbapenem antibiotics using, pneumonia and adverse prognosis in CRAB group were higher than those in CSAB group (6 cases (25%) vs. 4 cases (5%), 18 cases (75%) vs. 36 cases (49%), 17 cases (71%) vs. 17 cases (23%), 6 cases (25%) vs. 4 cases (5%), χ<sup>2</sup>=5.61, 5.09, 18.32, 5.61, all P 0.05). Seventy-seven cases were nosocomial infection and 21 cases were hospital-acquired infection. The proportion of children hospitalized in high-risk wards for nosocomial infections, length of hospitalization, number of antimicrobial therapy received and duration of antimicrobial therapy were higher in the hospital associated infection group than those in the community acquired infection group (all P 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that children from rural area ( OR =8.42, 95% CI 1.45-48.88), prior mechanical ventilation ( OR =12.62, 95% CI 1.31-121.76), and prior antibiotic therapy ( OR =4.90, 95% CI 1.35-17.72) were independent risk factors for CRAB infection. The resistance percentage of CSAB isolates to many classes of antibiotics was 6% except to gentamicin, which was as high as 20% (13/65). All CRAB isolates of resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam (20/20), cefepime (23/23), piperacillin (17/17), meropenem (23/23) and imipenem (24/24) were 100%.

Patients: Fifty-nine patients who experienced acute-onset idiopathic tinnitus (within 12 weeks) with normal hearing and the same number of age- and pure-tone threshold-matched control groups. Intervention: Electrophysiologic studies of the auditory pathway, oral steroids, and ginkgo biloba. Main outcome measures: Pure-tone thresholds, wave I and wave V amplitudes of the auditory brainstem response (ABR), tinnitus handicap inventory (THI), and visual analog scale (VAS). Results: Significantly reduced ABR wave I amplitude and wave I/wave V ratio were found in the tinnitus group compared with the no tinnitus group. Age and pure-tone threshold were significantly correlated with reduced wave I amplitude and small wave I/wave V ratio. The THI and VAS scores were decreased at 3 and 12 weeks after steroid administration; however, overall changes in THI and VAS scores were not significantly different between the steroid and ginkgo biloba groups. Conclusion: Potential cochlear synaptopathy was suspected in the early stage of acute idiopathic tinnitus, even in patients with normal hearing. Age and hearing threshold were potentially associated with the development of cochlear synaptopathy.

Vascular risk factors play an important role in the pathogeneses of normal pressure glaucoma but high pressure glaucoma is also often accompanied by significant vascular components. Objective: What are the practice relevant possibilities of vascular glaucoma treatment? Material and methods: An evaluation of scientific articles from PubMed dealing with vascular glaucoma was carried out. Results: The treatment of vascular risk factors in glaucoma patients requires a thorough medical history regarding vascular symptoms (peripheral vasospasm, tinnitus, migraine etc.) and information on the presence of systemic diseases. Furthermore, a 24h blood pressure profile and the determination of the fat metabolism status represent important and simple examinations. Conclusion: Besides optimizing systemic blood pressure, reducing an increased central retinal venous pressure, treatment with statins, calcium channel blockers, Ginkgo biloba extract, increased physical exercise and fluid replacement are options to ameliorate vascular conditions.

Methods: A total of 78 patients were randomized into an ENA combined with HBOT (ENA+HBOT) group and a HBOT group, 39 cases in each one. Patients in both groups were treated with oral extract of ginkgo biloba leaves and mecobalamin tablets. On the basis of the conventional medication treatment, HBOT was adopt in the HBOT group. On the basis of the treatment in the HBOT group, electro-nape-acupuncture was applied at Fengchi (GB 20), Gongxue (Extra), Zhongzhu (TE 3), Waiguan (TE 5) and Yifeng (TE 17), Tinggong (SI 19), Tinghui (GB 2) and the vertigo-auditory area of affected side in the ENA+HBOT group. Pulse acupuncture instrument was connected at Fengchi (GB 20) and Gongxue (Extra) for 30 min (with continuous wave, 2 Hz in frequency), the needles were retained for another 30 min after electroaupuncture. The treatment was given once a day, 6 times a week for 4 weeks in both groups. Before the treatment and 2,4 weeks into the treatment, the average auditory threshold, the scores of tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) and dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) were observed, and the therapeutic effect was evaluated in both groups. Results: Compared before treatment, the average auditory threshold, the scores of THI and DHI of 2,4 weeks into the treatment were decreased in both groups ( P 0.000 1). Compared with the HBOT group, the average auditory threshold, the scores of THI and DHI of 4 weeks into the treatment were lower in the ENA+HBOT group ( P 0.000 1). The total effective rate was 69.2% (27/39) in the ENA+HBOT group and 51.3% (20/39) in the HBOT group, there was no statistical difference ( P &gt;0.05). Conclusion: Electro-nape- acupuncture can improve the mean auditory threshold and the symptoms of tinnitus and dizziness in patients with refractory flat descending idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.",0.9996979236602783

Cochlear synaptic tinnitus is the most common type. Many treatments have been tried but none is yet considered to be well established. To evaluate effect of Inj.Caroverine and Ginkgo Biloba extract in cochlear synaptic tinnitus in terms of improving tinnitus grading, tinnitus matching and quality of life of patient. It is Randomised controlled study, conducted in department of ENT, on 86 patients, who met inclusion criteria, divided into 4 groups. Gr1-Inj Caroverin, Gr2-Inj Placebo, Gr3-Ginkgo Biloba extract, Gr4-Placebo as extract. A single dose infusion of caroverine immediately improves tinnitus grading and matching and provides immediate relief in reducing severity of tinnitus in 54.54% cases but improvement was not sustained in caroverine group at 3 month and 6 month follow-up after infusion. Ginkgo biloba also is effective in improving tinnitus grading and matching in 31.8% cases and improvement was sustained in ginkgo biloba group even after 3 month of cessation of treatment i.e. at 6 month follow-up. It is suggested that Inj.Caroverine as intravenous infusion should be given in severe cases of tinnitus to reduce its severity immediately and then patient should be put on Tab.Ginkgo biloba for a period of 3 months to provide sustained and long lasting relief. Thus combination therapy of Inj.Caroverin and Tab.Ginkgo Biloba, appropriately tailored to the need of patient will provide better results in greater majority of patients.",0.9998453855514526

It has been the subject of a great number of studies, especially considering its consequences on patient's quality of life. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of hearing aids and/or Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 on tinnitus in patients with hearing loss. Methods: This is a trial randomized-controlled treatment, parallel, double-blind, with three-arm. Thirty-three adults subjects were divided into three groups: group 1 - subjects undergoing drug therapy with Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761; group 2 - individuals fitted with digital hearing aids; group 3 - individuals submitted to drug therapy with Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 and using hearing aids. The tinnitus handicap inventory and visual analogue scale were used to evaluate self-perception of tinnitus loudness and severity before treatment and 90 days after treatment. Results: This study demonstrated a significant correlation between tinnitus handicap inventory and visual analogue scale, before and after treatment. We observed a significant improvement in self-perception of tinnitus loudness and severity after 90 days of treatment with Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 and/or hearing aids. No correlation was found between tinnitus onset time and self-perception of tinnitus loudness and severity. Hearing aids were more effective in patients with a shorter tinnitus onset time and Ginkgo biloba extract was effective regardless of tinnitus duration. Conclusions: It was possible to prove the effectiveness of the hearing aids and/or Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 treatment, which shows success in the control of tinnitus contributing to the improvement of this symptom.",0.9998815059661865
32,2019,30439402,Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,ginkgo biloba tinnitus,0.0,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: In Traditional Oriental Medicine (TOM), the development of hearing pathologies is related to an inadequate nourishment of the ears by the kidney and other organs involved in regulation of bodily fluids and nutrients. Several herbal species have historically been prescribed for promoting the production of bodily fluids or as antiaging agents to treat deficiencies in hearing. Aim of review: The prevalence of hearing loss has been increasing in the last decade and is projected to grow considerably in the coming years. Recently, several herbal-derived products prescribed in TOM have demonstrated a therapeutic potential for acquired sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus. Therefore, the aims of this review are to provide a comprehensive overview of the current known efficacy of the herbs used in TOM for preventing different forms of acquired sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, and associate the traditional principle with the demonstrated pharmacological mechanisms to establish a solid foundation for directing future research. Methods: The present review collected the literature related to herbs used in TOM or related compounds on hearing from Chinese, Korean, and Japanese herbal classics; library catalogs; and scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar; and Science Direct). Results: This review shows that approximately 25 herbal species and 40 active compounds prescribed in TOM for hearing loss and tinnitus have shown in vitro or in vivo beneficial effects for acquired sensorineural hearing loss produced by noise, aging, ototoxic drugs or diabetes. The inner ear is highly vulnerable to ischemia and oxidative damage, where several TOM agents have revealed a direct effect on the auditory system by normalizing the blood supply to the cochlea and increasing the antioxidant defense in sensory hair cells. These strategies have shown a positive impact on maintaining the inner ear potential, sustaining the production of endolymph, reducing the accumulation of toxic and inflammatory substances, preventing sensory cell death and preserving sensory transmission. There are still several herbal species with demonstrated therapeutic efficacy whose mechanisms have not been deeply studied and others that have been traditionally used in hearing loss but have not been tested experimentally. In clinical studies, Ginkgo biloba, Panax ginseng, and Astragalus propinquus have demonstrated to improve hearing thresholds in patients with sensorineural hearing loss and alleviated the symptoms of tinnitus. However, some of these clinical studies have been limited by small sample sizes, lack of an adequate control group or contradictory results. Conclusions: Current therapeutic strategies have proven that the goal of the traditional oriental medicine principle of increasing bodily fluids is a relevant approach for reducing the development of hearing loss by improving microcirculation in the blood-labyrinth barrier and increasing cochlear blood flow. The potential benefits of TOM agents expand to a multi-target approach on different auditory structures of the inner ear related to increased cochlear blood flow, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective activities. However, more research is required, given the evidence is very limited in terms of the mechanism of action at the preclinical in vivo level and the scarce number of clinical studies published.",0.9998028874397278
33,2019,34985167,Does hypnotherapy help people quit smoking?,hypnotherapy quit smoking,0.0,"Aims: To investigate the comparative and combined effectiveness of four types of components of behavioural interventions for cigarette smoking cessation: behavioural (e.g. counselling), motivational (e.g. focus on reasons to quit), delivery mode (e.g. phone) and provider (e.g. nurse). Design: Systematic review and component network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials identified from Cochrane reviews. Interventions included behavioural interventions for smoking cessation (including all non-pharmacological interventions, e.g. counselling, exercise, hypnotherapy, self-help materials), compared with another behavioural intervention or no support. Building on a 2021 review (CD013229), we conducted three analyses, investigating: comparative effectiveness of the components, whether models that allowed interactions between components gave different results to models assuming additivity, and predicted effect estimates for combined effects of components that had showed promise but where there were few trials. Setting: Community and health-care settings. Participants: Adults who smoke tobacco. Measurements: Smoking cessation at ≥6 months, preferring sustained, biochemically validated outcomes where available. Findings: Three hundred and twelve trials (250 563 participants) were included. Fifty were at high risk of bias using Cochrane risk of bias tool, V1 (ROB1); excluding these studies did not change findings. Head-to-head comparisons of components suggested that support via text message (SMS) compared with telephone (OR 1.48, 95% CrI 1.13-1.94) or print materials (OR 1.44, 95% CrI 1.14-1.83) was more effective, and individual delivery was less effective than delivery as part of a group (OR 0.78, 95% CrI 0.64-0.95). There was no conclusive evidence of synergistic or antagonistic interactions when combining components that were commonly used together. Adding multiple components that are commonly used in behavioural counselling suggested clinically relevant and statistically conclusive evidence of benefit. Components with the largest effects that could be combined, but rarely have been, were estimated to increase the odds of quitting between two and threefold. For example, financial incentives delivered via SMS, with tailoring and a focus on how to quit, had an estimated OR of 2.94 (95% CrI 1.91-4.52). Conclusions: Among the components of behavioural support for smoking cessation, behavioural counselling and guaranteed financial incentives are associated with the greatest success. Incorporating additional components associated with effectiveness may further increase benefit, with delivery via text message showing particular promise.",0.9993599057197571

Objective: The goal of this study was to identify and describe nicotine-related topics of conversation authored by the public and social bots on Twitter, including any misinformation or misconceptions that health education campaigns could potentially correct. Methods: Twitter posts containing the term ""nicotine"" were obtained from September 30, 2018 to October 1, 2019. Methods were used to distinguish between posts from social bots and nonbots. Text classifiers were used to identify topics in posts (n=300,360). Results: Prevalent topics of posts included vaping, smoking, addiction, withdrawal, nicotine health risks, and quit nicotine, with mentions of going ""cold turkey"" and needing help in quitting. Cessation was a common topic, with mentions of quitting and stopping smoking. Social bots discussed unsubstantiated health claims including how hypnotherapy, acupuncture, magnets worn on the ears, and time spent in the sauna can help in smoking cessation. Conclusions: Health education efforts are needed to correct unsubstantiated health claims on Twitter and ultimately direct individuals who want to quit smoking to evidence-based cessation strategies. Future interventions could be designed to follow these topics of discussions on Twitter and engage with members of the public about evidence-based cessation methods in near real time when people are contemplating cessation.",0.00044382939813658595
33,2019,33411338,Does hypnotherapy help people quit smoking?,hypnotherapy quit smoking,0.0,"Background: Smoking is a leading cause of disease and death worldwide. In people who smoke, quitting smoking can reverse much of the damage. Many people use behavioural interventions to help them quit smoking; these interventions can vary substantially in their content and effectiveness. Objectives: To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effect of behavioural interventions designed to support smoking cessation attempts and to conduct a network meta-analysis to determine how modes of delivery; person delivering the intervention; and the nature, focus, and intensity of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation influence the likelihood of achieving abstinence six months after attempting to stop smoking; and whether the effects of behavioural interventions depend upon other characteristics, including population, setting, and the provision of pharmacotherapy. To summarise the availability and principal findings of economic evaluations of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation, in terms of comparative costs and cost-effectiveness, in the form of a brief economic commentary. Methods: This work comprises two main elements. 1. We conducted a Cochrane Overview of reviews following standard Cochrane methods. We identified Cochrane Reviews of behavioural interventions (including all non-pharmacological interventions, e.g. counselling, exercise, hypnotherapy, self-help materials) for smoking cessation by searching the Cochrane Library in July 2020. We evaluated the methodological quality of reviews using AMSTAR 2 and synthesised data from the reviews narratively. 2. We used the included reviews to identify randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation compared with other behavioural interventions or no intervention for smoking cessation. To be included, studies had to include adult smokers and measure smoking abstinence at six months or longer. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. We synthesised data using Bayesian component network meta-analysis (CNMA), examining the effects of 38 different components compared to minimal intervention. Components included behavioural and motivational elements, intervention providers, delivery modes, nature, focus, and intensity of the behavioural intervention. We used component network meta-regression (CNMR) to evaluate the influence of population characteristics, provision of pharmacotherapy, and intervention intensity on the component effects. We evaluated certainty of the evidence using GRADE domains. We assumed an additive effect for individual components. Main results: We included 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which 312 randomised controlled trials, representing 250,563 participants and 845 distinct study arms, met the criteria for inclusion in our component network meta-analysis. This represented 437 different combinations of components. Of the 33 reviews, confidence in review findings was high in four reviews and moderate in nine reviews, as measured by the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool. The remaining 20 reviews were low or critically low due to one or more critical weaknesses, most commonly inadequate investigation or discussion (or both) of the impact of publication bias. Of note, the critical weaknesses identified did not affect the searching, screening, or data extraction elements of the review process, which have direct bearing on our CNMA. Of the included studies, 125/312 were at low risk of bias overall, 50 were at high risk of bias, and the remainder were at unclear risk. Analyses from the contributing reviews and from our CNMA showed behavioural interventions for smoking cessation can increase quit rates, but effectiveness varies on characteristics of the support provided. There was high-certainty evidence of benefit for the provision of counselling (odds ratio (OR) 1.44, 95% credibility interval (CrI) 1.22 to 1.70, 194 studies, n = 72,273) and guaranteed financial incentives (OR 1.46, 95% CrI 1.15 to 1.85, 19 studies, n = 8877). Evidence of benefit remained when removing studies at high risk of bias. These findings were consistent with pair-wise meta-analyses from contributing reviews. There was moderate-certainty evidence of benefit for interventions delivered via text message (downgraded due to unexplained statistical heterogeneity in pair-wise comparison), and for the following components where point estimates suggested benefit but CrIs incorporated no clinically significant difference: individual tailoring; intervention content including motivational components; intervention content focused on how to quit. The remaining intervention components had low-to very low-certainty evidence, with the main issues being imprecision and risk of bias. There was no evidence to suggest an increase in harms in groups receiving behavioural support for smoking cessation. Intervention effects were not changed by adjusting for population characteristics, but data were limited. Increasing intensity of behavioural support, as measured through the number of contacts, duration of each contact, and programme length, had point estimates associated with modestly increased chances of quitting, but CrIs included no difference. The effect of behavioural support for smoking cessation appeared slightly less pronounced when people were already receiving smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. Authors' conclusions: Behavioural support for smoking cessation can increase quit rates at six months or longer, with no evidence that support increases harms. This is the case whether or not smoking cessation pharmacotherapy is also provided, but the effect is slightly more pronounced in the absence of pharmacotherapy. Evidence of benefit is strongest for the provision of any form of counselling, and guaranteed financial incentives. Evidence suggested possible benefit but the need of further studies to evaluate: individual tailoring; delivery via text message, email, and audio recording; delivery by lay health advisor; and intervention content with motivational components and a focus on how to quit. We identified 23 economic evaluations; evidence did not consistently suggest one type of behavioural intervention for smoking cessation was more cost-effective than another. Future reviews should fully consider publication bias. Tools to investigate publication bias and to evaluate certainty in CNMA are needed.",0.9996238946914673

This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of commonly used smoking cessation aids and test whether their effectiveness differs according to cigarette addiction, socio-economic status, age or sex. Design: Correlational design using cross-sectional survey data collected monthly between 2006 and 2018. Setting: England. Participants: A total of 18 929 adults (aged ≥ 16 years, 52.0% female) who had smoked within the previous 12 months and had made at least one quit attempt during that period. Measurements: The outcome was self-reported abstinence from quit date to survey. Independent variables were self-reported use during the most recent quit attempt of: prescription nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), NRT over-the-counter, varenicline, bupropion, e-cigarettes, face-to-face behavioural support, telephone support, written self-help materials, websites and hypnotherapy. Moderators were cigarette addiction, social grade, age and sex. Findings: After adjustment for covariates and use of other cessation aids, users of e-cigarettes [odds ratio (OR) = 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.69-2.24] and varenicline (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.51-2.21) had significantly higher odds of reporting abstinence than those who did not report use of these cessation aids. Use of prescription NRT was associated with increased abstinence in older (≥ 45 years) (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.25-2.00) but not younger ( 45 years) smokers (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.85-1.42). Use of websites was associated with increased abstinence in smokers from lower (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.22-3.98) but not higher social grades (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.40-1.38). There was little evidence of benefits of using other cessation aids. Conclusions: Use of e-cigarettes and varenicline are associated with higher abstinence rates following a quit attempt in England. Use of prescription of nicotine replacement therapy is also associated with higher abstinence rates, but only in older smokers, and use of websites only in smokers from lower socio-economic status.",0.9996809959411621
33,2019,29320084,Does hypnotherapy help people quit smoking?,hypnotherapy quit smoking,0.0,"Many interventions to quit smoking, increase physical activity, reduce weight and improve diet can reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The interventions seem to produce only small effects, if any, and there is a lack of evidence regarding effects on morbidity and mortality. A small or moderate effect may be important, though, both for the individual but particularly at population level. Several interventions support smoking cessation: mass media campaigns targeted at young people and adults, advice from health professionals both in primary care and hospitals, self help programs, group therapy, telephone advice, interventions in the workplace, nicotine replacement, bupropion and varenicline. Mass media campaigns aimed at adult established smokers seemed to have similar effects regardless of age, gender, ethnicity or education. Biomedical risk assessments and hypnosis are unlikely to help smokers to quit. We can not draw conclusions on the effects on smoking rates of training of health professionals, school-based or family-based programs, acupuncture, physical activity, interventions for preventing tobacco sales to minors or relapse prevention. Physical activity interventions moderately improve self-reported physical activity and cardio-respiratory fitness, and help achieving a predetermined activity level. Exercise for overweight and type 2 diabetes supports weight reduction and reduces cardiovascular disease risk factors even if no weight is lost. Calorie restricted diets in overweight hypertensive persons can give modest weight loss and blood pressure decreases. Weight loss strategies in prediabetes may reduce weight and diabetes incidence. Dietary advice, advice to reduce or modify fat intake and reduce intake of salt may have a small, but important effect on cardiovascular risk factors. There are no high quality data on the efficacy of the dietary treatment of type 2 diabetes or familial hypercholesterolaemia. An organized system of regular review may reduce blood pressure.

Study design and setting: Prospective cohort study located in 23 general practices in England, Scotland. and Wales and including 3,622 women aged 60 to 79 years at recruitment from the British Women's Heart and Health Study. Results: Of the 370 smokers at baseline, 77 (21%) had stopped smoking at 3 years, reducing the prevalence of smoking from 10.2% to 8.8%. Women who were light smokers ( 10 per day) at baseline were more likely to have quit than heavier smokers. The most common interventions reported by women who smoked at baseline were advice from a general practitioner (GP), family or friend's advice, and use of nicotine replacement, but 42% of the women reported having no intervention to help them to stop smoking. None of the individual interventions were associated with increased odds of quitting smoking over the follow-up period. Women reported finding a GP's advice, referral to a clinic, and nicotine replacement more useful than complementary treatments (acupuncture and hypnotherapy) or advice from family and friends. Conclusion: Smoking cessation rates in this study were in line with national targets and surveys. Self-reports of ever receiving interventions were not associated with quitting smoking among these older women. Different and innovative approaches to smoking cessation may need to be developed, and evaluated in future randomized clinical trials, for individuals who have smoked for a long period of time and for whom other smoking cessation interventions have not proved successful.",0.9996272325515747

Following personal advice and encouragement to stop smoking given by physicians during a single routine consultation, an estimated 2% (95% confidence limits, 1%, 3%; P .001) of all smokers stopped smoking and did not relapse up to 1 year as a direct consequence of the advice. The effect is modest but cost-effective: the cost of saving a life is about $1500. Supplementary interventions (follow-up letters or visits, demonstration of spirometry, etc) have an additional effect--variable in extent. Advice and encouragement are particularly effective for smokers at special risk--pregnant women (efficacy; 8%) and patients with ischemic heart disease. Behavior modification techniques (relaxation, rewards and punishment, avoiding ""trigger"" situations, etc), in group or individual sessions led by a psychologist, have an effect that is statistically significant (P = .05) but no greater than simple advice by a physician (2%); yet, these techniques are several times more expensive. The effect of hypnosis is unproved (no trials have used biochemical markers). Nicotine replacement therapy is effective in an estimated 13% of smokers who seek help in cessation; the effect is greater in those who are nicotine-dependent. Other pharmacological treatments are not of proven efficacy, and acupuncture is ineffective. Sudden cessation or gradual reduction in smoking are similar in their efficacy on average.

Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Risks of smoking-related disease and death decline sharply when smokers quit, but 26% of Americans continue to smoke. Most smokers find it extremely difficult to quit smoking because of their nicotine addiction. Nonpharmacologic interventions used to promote smoking cessation include behavioral therapy, setting a specific date for quitting, receiving advice to quit from a health care professional, follow-up visits to review progress, self-help approaches, group counseling, filtration devices, hypnosis, and acupuncture. The efficacy of these approaches ranges from substantial to almost nil. The only pharmacologic agent with FDA-approved labeling for use in smoking-cessation therapy is nicotine. When used in conjunction with appropriate nonpharmacologic interventions, nicotine-replacement therapy roughly doubles the rate of quitting obtained with placebo. Nicotine-replacement therapies consist of nicotine transdermal (patch) systems and nicotine chewing gum. The nicotine patch is the first-line replacement therapy because it is effective when accompanied by only minimal (as opposed to more intensive) nonpharmacologic interventions and because it is easier to use and comply with than gum. Clonidine, antidepressants, and buspirone require further study to determine what role, if any, they should play in the treatment of nicotine dependence. The stages of smoking cessation are precontemplation, contemplation, action, and maintenance; interventions are selected on the basis of the stage the smoker is in. Nicotine dependence is difficult to treat, but there are aids that boost a smoker's chances of quitting.

Objective: The objective of the clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and stabilization exercises on pelvic pain in pelvic cancer survivors following multimodal treatment. Materials and methods: Thirty-one patients including both male and female adults treated for pelvic cancers were recruited in the study. Outcome measures in terms of pain were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study by the visual analog scale and genitourinary pain index (GUPI) scale, abdominal muscle strength by pressure biofeedback unit for transverse abdominal (TrA) muscle, and quality of life (QOL) by functional assessment of cancer therapy general questionnaire.

Methods: We searched the Cochrane Library to January 2021 (CDSR; 2021, Issue 1) and included any Cochrane Review that included studies with women aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of SUI, UUI or MUI, and investigating a conservative intervention aimed at improving or curing UI. We included reviews that compared a conservative intervention with 'control' (which included placebo, no treatment or usual care), another conservative intervention or another active, but non-conservative, intervention. A stakeholder group informed the selection and synthesis of evidence. Two overview authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data and judged review quality, resolving disagreements through discussion. Primary outcomes of interest were patient-reported cure or improvement and condition-specific quality of life. We judged the risk of bias in included reviews using the ROBIS tool. We judged the certainty of evidence within the reviews based on the GRADE approach. Evidence relating to SUI, UUI or all types of UI combined (AUI) were synthesised separately. The AUI group included evidence relating to participants with MUI, as well as from studies that combined women with different diagnoses (i.e. SUI, UUI and MUI) and studies in which the type of UI was unclear. Main results: We included 29 relevant Cochrane Reviews. Seven focused on physical therapies; five on education, behavioural and lifestyle advice; one on mechanical devices; one on acupuncture and one on yoga. Fourteen focused on non-conservative interventions but had a comparison with a conservative intervention. No reviews synthesised evidence relating to psychological therapies. There were 112 unique trials (including 8975 women) that had primary outcome data included in at least one analysis. Stress urinary incontinence (14 reviews) Conservative intervention versus control: there was moderate or high certainty evidence that pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), PFMT plus biofeedback and cones were more beneficial than control for curing or improving UI. PFMT and intravaginal devices improved quality of life compared to control. One conservative intervention versus another conservative intervention: for cure and improvement of UI, there was moderate or high certainty evidence that: continence pessary plus PFMT was more beneficial than continence pessary alone; PFMT plus educational intervention was more beneficial than cones; more-intensive PFMT was more beneficial than less-intensive PFMT; and PFMT plus an adherence strategy was more beneficial than PFMT alone. There was no moderate or high certainty evidence for quality of life. Urgency urinary incontinence (five reviews) Conservative intervention versus control: there was moderate to high-certainty evidence demonstrating that PFMT plus feedback, PFMT plus biofeedback, electrical stimulation and bladder training were more beneficial than control for curing or improving UI. Women using electrical stimulation plus PFMT had higher quality of life than women in the control group. One conservative intervention versus another conservative intervention: for cure or improvement, there was moderate certainty evidence that electrical stimulation was more effective than laseropuncture. There was high or moderate certainty evidence that PFMT resulted in higher quality of life than electrical stimulation and electrical stimulation plus PFMT resulted in better cure or improvement and higher quality of life than PFMT alone. All types of urinary incontinence (13 reviews) Conservative intervention versus control: there was moderate to high certainty evidence of better cure or improvement with PFMT, electrical stimulation, weight loss and cones compared to control. There was moderate certainty evidence of improved quality of life with PFMT compared to control. One conservative intervention versus another conservative intervention: there was moderate or high certainty evidence of better cure or improvement for PFMT with bladder training than bladder training alone. Likewise, PFMT with more individual health professional supervision was more effective than less contact/supervision and more-intensive PFMT was more beneficial than less-intensive PFMT. There was moderate certainty evidence that PFMT plus bladder training resulted in higher quality of life than bladder training alone. Authors' conclusions: There is high certainty that PFMT is more beneficial than control for all types of UI for outcomes of cure or improvement and quality of life. We are moderately certain that, if PFMT is more intense, more frequent, with individual supervision, with/without combined with behavioural interventions with/without an adherence strategy, effectiveness is improved. We are highly certain that, for cure or improvement, cones are more beneficial than control (but not PFMT) for women with SUI, electrical stimulation is beneficial for women with UUI, and weight loss results in more cure and improvement than control for women with AUI. Most evidence within the included Cochrane Reviews is of low certainty. It is important that future new and updated Cochrane Reviews develop questions that are more clinically useful, avoid multiple overlapping reviews and consult women with UI to further identify outcomes of importance.",0.999659538269043
34,2019,35997889,How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,exercises for female incontinence,1.0,"Purpose of review: The purpose of this review is to summarize and assess the current non-surgical devices for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Recent findings: Devices for SUI can generally be divided into two categories. One category is the augmentation of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), wherein devices such as vaginal cones, intravaginal biofeedback, and electrical or magnetic stimulation are used to strength the pelvic floor musculature, though none are more effective than traditional PFMT. The second category of devices mechanically occludes the outlet and includes incontinence pessaries, intravaginal occlusion devices, and urethral plugs and patches. While these are palliative rather than curative, they share similar rates of improvement in leakage. A number of novel devices exist for the treatment and management of SUI. Though no single device has been shown to be more effective than PFMT alone, they may be beneficial for women who have difficulty isolating their pelvic floor muscles, desire accountability, or prefer technology-based engagement. Outlet occlusion devices are less comfortable for the patient, but remain an option for women who do not desire surgery.",0.9988915324211121
34,2019,35934663,How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,exercises for female incontinence,1.0,"Background: In women with overactive bladder (OAB), sexual dysfunctions and sexual satisfaction of their partners have been problems that are as important as urinary symptoms. Aim: To investigate the effects of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on sexual dysfunction, sexual satisfaction of partners, urinary symptoms, and pelvic floor muscle strength (PFMS) in women with OAB. Methods: Women with OAB were randomized into 2 groups: 6-week PFMT (n = 21) (home exercise program) and a control group (n = 22) (did not receive any treatment for OAB). Outcomes: Sexual dysfunction, sexual satisfaction of partner, urinary symptoms, and PFMS were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the OAB-Version8 (OAB-V8), and the Modified Oxford Scale (MOS), respectively. Results: After 6 weeks, there was an increase in FSFI domains [desire (95% CI: 0.18 to 0.64; P:.001, d: 0.88); arousal (95% CI: 0.42 to 1.24, P: .001, d: 1.17); orgasm (95% CI:0.85 to 1.47; P: .001, d:1.89); satisfaction (95% CI: 0.85 to 1.44; P: .001, d: 2.29); sexual pain (95% CI:0.80 to 1.52; P: .001, d:1.47); total score (95% CI: 3.70 to 5.94; P: .001, d: 2.55)], sexual satisfaction of partners (95% CI: 1.80 to 2.85; P: .001, d:2.83) and PFMS scores (95% CI: 1.10 to 1.55; P: .001, d:3.18), and a decrease in the OAB-V8 score (95% CI: -13.01 to -7.10; P: .001, d:2.19) in the PFMT group compared to the control group. There was a significant decrease in sexual dysfunction in the PFMT group compared to the control group (P:.046). Clinical implications: In order to improve sexual function, sexual satisfaction of the partners, urinary symptoms, and PFMS in women with OAB, PFMT should be added to the rehabilitation program in clinics. Strengths &amp; limitations: The strength of this study was that it is a randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of PFMT in improving sexual function in OAB. The limitations of our study were the lack of a long-term (6 months-1 year) follow-up and the inability to blind. Conclusion: PFMT was effective in improving sexual dysfunction, sexual satisfaction of partners, urinary symptoms, and PFMS in women with OAB. Celenay ST, Karaaslan Y, Ozdemir E.

34,2019,35852280,How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,exercises for female incontinence,1.0,"Objective: To assess the clinical efficacy of commercially available pelvic muscle training devices on the treatment of pelvic floor disorders. Data sources: We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov through April 2020. We included observational cohort studies and randomized trials. Case reports, case series, and conference poster presentations were excluded. Studies using vaginal weights or cones and those conducted in the peripartum periods were also excluded. Tabulation, integration, and results: A total of 294 studies were screened. Twenty-six studies were included in the qualitative analysis, and 15 studies were eligible for meta-analyses. Study characteristics and quality were recorded for each study. Meta-analysis showed a large positive effect of commercially available pelvic floor training devices on pelvic floor muscle strength by both objective and subjective measures. Meta-analysis of objective measures showed a reduction of 1.2 pads per day (P .01), 1.3 incontinence episodes per day, (P .01) and 11 g on 24-hour pad test (P .01). Meta-analysis of subjective measures showed a reduction in UDI-6 (Urogenital Distress Inventory, Short Form) scores by 25.1 points (P .01) and in IIQ-7 scores (Incontinence Impact Questionnaire, Short Form) by 14.1 points (P=.01). There was an increase in I-QOL (Incontinence Quality of Life) scores by 16.8 points (P .01). The minimal important difference was met for the UDI-6 and I-QOL but not for the IIQ-7. We were unable to perform meta-analysis to evaluate whether pelvic floor training devices are as effective as traditional supervised pelvic floor physical therapy. Conclusion: Commercially available home pelvic floor training devices are effective in increasing strength of pelvic floor muscles and in the treatment of pelvic floor disorders.",0.999761164188385
34,2019,35753969,How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,exercises for female incontinence,1.0,"Question(s): How cost-effective is group-based pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) for treating urinary incontinence in older women? Design: Economic evaluation conducted alongside an assessor-blinded, multicentre randomised non-inferiority trial with 1-year follow-up. Participants: A total of 362 women aged ≥ 60 years with stress or mixed urinary incontinence. Intervention: Twelve weekly 1-hour PFMT sessions delivered individually (one physiotherapist per woman) or in groups (one physiotherapist per eight women). Outcome measures: Urinary incontinence-related costs per woman were estimated from a participant and provider perspective over 1 year in Canadian dollars, 2019. Effectiveness was based on reduction in leakage episodes and quality-adjusted life years. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefit were calculated for each of the effectiveness outcomes and perspectives. Results: Both group-based and individual PFMT were effective in reducing leakage and promoting gains in quality-adjusted life years. Furthermore, group-based PFMT was ≥ 60% less costly than individual treatment, regardless of the perspective studied: -$914 (95% CI -970 to -863) from the participant's perspective and -$509 (95% CI -523 to -496) from the provider's perspective. Differences in effects between study arms were minor and negligible. Adherence to treatment was high, with low loss to follow-up and no between-group differences. Conclusion: Compared with standard individual PFMT, group-based PFMT was less costly and as clinically effective and widely accepted. These results indicate that patients and healthcare decision-makers should consider group-based PFMT to be a cost-effective first-line treatment option for urinary incontinence.

34,2019,35686543,How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,exercises for female incontinence,1.0,"Objective: This meta-analysis aims to compare biofeedback-assisted pelvic muscle floor training (PFMT) and pelvic electrical stimulation (ES) as an intervention group, with PFMT or bladder training (BT) as the control group, in women with an overactive bladder (OAB). Method: PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Scopus were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to November 2021. The RCTs were screened for our eligibility criteria and quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk Index of Bias tools. The outcomes were changes in quality of life (QoL), episodes of incontinence, and the number of participants cured/improved. Results: Eight studies involving 562 patients (comprising 204 patients with biofeedback-assisted PFMT, 108 patients with pelvic ES, and 250 patients who received PFMT alone or BT and lifestyle recommendations only, as the control group) were included. The ES group showed significant differences in terms of changes to QoL (mean difference [MD]: 7.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.90-12.92, p = 0.008), episodes of incontinence (MD: -1.33, 95% CI: -2.50 to -0.17, p = 0.02), and the number of participants cured or improved (risk ratio [RR]: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.14-1.87, p = 0.003), while the biofeedback group resulted in nonsignificant changes in QoL (MD: 0.13, 95% CI: 7.87-8.12, p = 0.98), episodes of incontinence (MD: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.89 to 0.90, p = 0.99), and the number of participants cured or improved (RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.99-1.33, p = 0.08), both compared to the control group respectively. Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that low-frequency pelvic ES appears to be sufficient and effective as an additional intervention for women with OAB in clinical practice according to improvements in the subjects' QoL and reduction of symptoms. Meanwhile, biofeedback-assisted PFMT does not appear to be a significant adjuvant for conservative OAB therapy.",0.9997716546058655
34,2019,35662546,How effective are pelvic floor exercises for treating female incontinence?,exercises for female incontinence,1.0,"Background: Stress urinary incontinence is a common condition that can be treated conservatively and/or surgically. Given the risks of surgery, developing effective nonsurgical treatment options would be beneficial. Some studies have suggested that laser therapy may improve or cure stress urinary incontinence. However, there is a lack of sham-controlled randomized controlled trials to judge treatment efficacy. Objective: This study aimed to compare the effects of CO 2 vaginal laser vs sham therapy for treating stress urinary incontinence. Study design: This was a multicenter, participant-blinded, sham-controlled, parallel group (1:1) superiority randomized controlled trial performed in outpatient clinics in 2 hospitals. We included women aged 18 to 80 years with objective and subjective stress urinary incontinence. Participants had undertaken or declined supervised pelvic floor muscle training. Intervention was performed using a CO 2 fractionated vaginal laser. Participants underwent 3 treatments, 4 weeks apart, with increasing energy and density settings. Sham treatment was performed using an identical technique with a deactivated pedal. The primary outcome was the subjective stress urinary incontinence rate (proportion with leak with cough, sneeze, or laughter) at 3 months after completion of treatment. Secondary outcomes included objective stress urinary incontinence, change in the disease-specific patient-reported outcomes, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects. Categorical outcomes were compared using the chi square test and continuous outcomes using analysis of covariance, adjusting for the baseline score. Results: There were 52 participants who received laser and 49 who received sham treatment. One participant in each group withdrew from the study before the endpoint, and 2 participants in the laser group did not participate in the follow-up visits. Participant mean age was 53 (34-79) years. Mean body mass index was 26.1 (18.1-49.6); 90% were vaginally parous. At 3 months, there was no difference between the sham and active treatment arm in subjective stress urinary incontinence (46 [96%] vs 48 [98%]; relative risk, 0.98 [95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.05]; P=.55) or in objective stress urinary incontinence (37 [80%] vs 33 [80%]; relative risk, 0.99 [95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.23]; P=.995). Patient-reported outcomes and health-related quality of life were also comparable between the groups. Vaginal bleeding occurred in 3 participants after laser and 1 participant after sham treatment. Pain during treatment did not differ between laser and sham treatment. Conclusion: We were unable to show an improvement in stress urinary incontinence after CO 2 vaginal laser therapy compared with sham treatment.",0.9856154918670654

Methods: We conducted a prospective nonrandomized study of 46 women with SUI. Assessments included: PFM functions (secondary outcome, SO) using a Myomed 932 EMG biofeedback device, urinary incontinence symptoms using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-SF; primary outcome), the Urogenital Distress Inventory-6 (UDI-6; SO), and the Incontinence Severity Index (ISI; SO), and perception of improvement using the Global Perceived Impact scale. The women were divided into three groups according to their preference: group 1 (Knack maneuver training with electromyography biofeedback), group 2 (Knack maneuver training with verbal instruction), and group 3 (Knack maneuver training with vaginal palpation). An education program was also given to all women individually. The training program was 1 day per week for 4 weeks. Results: There was an improvement in UDI-6, ICIQ-SF, and ISI scores in all groups (p 0.05). The maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of the PFMs increased in group 2 (p=0.002), whereas both the MVC of PFMs and PFM contraction during Valsalva increased in group 3 (p=0.011 and p=0.042). Conclusions: Regardless of the teaching methods, the Knack maneuver and education programs were effective on urinary symptoms in women with mild to moderate SUI. The Knack maneuver training with vaginal palpation and verbal instruction improved MVC of PFMs. All three different teaching methods might be used in SUI treatment programs.",0.999686598777771

We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of Tät II. Methods: A cost-utility analysis with a 1-year societal perspective was carried out, comparing Tät II with an information app. Data were collected alongside an RCT: 122 community-dwelling women aged ≥18 years with MUI or UUI ≥2 times/week were randomized to 3 months of Tät II treatment focused on pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and bladder training (BT; n = 60), or to an information app (n = 62). Self-assessed data from validated questionnaires were collected at baseline and at 3-month and 1-year follow-ups. Costs for assessment, treatment delivery, incontinence aids, laundry, and time for PFMT and BT were included. We calculated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between the groups was our primary outcome. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The mean age was 58.3 (SD = 9.6) years. Annual overall costs were €738.42 in the treatment group and €605.82 in the control group; annual QALY gains were 0.0152 and 0.0037 respectively. The base case ICER was €11,770.52; ICERs in the sensitivity analyses ranged from €-9,303.78 to €22,307.67. Conclusions: The app Tät II is a cost-effective treatment method for women with MUI and UUI.",0.9997469782829285
38,2019,36189059,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,"Spinal traction is a physical intervention that provides constant or intermittent stretching axial force to the lumbar vertebrae to gradually distract spinal tissues into better alignment, reduce intervertebral disc (IVD) pressure, and manage lower back pain (LBP). However, such axial traction may change the normal lordotic curvature, and result in unwanted side effects and/or inefficient reduction of the IVD pressure. An alternative to axial traction has been recently tested, consisting of posteroanterior (PA) traction in supine posture, which was recently shown effective to increase the intervertebral space and lordotic angle using MRI. PA traction aims to maintain the lumbar lordosis curvature throughout the spinal traction therapy while reducing the intradiscal pressure. In this study, we developed finite element simulations of mechanical therapy produced by a commercial thermo-mechanical massage bed capable of spinal PA traction. The stress relief produced on the lumbar discs by the posteroanterior traction system was investigated on human subject models with different BMI (normal, overweight, moderate obese and extreme obese BMI cases). We predict typical traction levels lead to significant distraction stresses in the lumbar discs, thus producing a stress relief by reducing the compression stresses normally experienced by these tissues. Also, the stress relief experienced by the lumbar discs was effective in all BMI models, and it was found maximal in the normal BMI model. These results are consistent with prior observations of therapeutic benefits derived from spinal AP traction.",0.9996541738510132

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate effectiveness of multimodal care featuring chiropractic spinal manipulation (CSMT) in 31 adults in Hong Kong with PSPS-2. MATERIAL AND METHODS We identified new adult patients with PSPS-2 receiving CSMT from 2016 to 2018. Demographic and clinical data and baseline/follow-up numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were extracted. Multiple linear regression was used to examine posttreatment NPRS and ODI reduction, with clinical variables as covariates. RESULTS Of 6589 patients with low back pain, 31 met criteria (mean age 52.2±13.7 years). Surgeries included laminectomy (81%), discectomy (13%), and fusion (6%). Mean baseline NRPS was 6.6±1.9; ODI was 43.8±15.1%. Patients received CSMT (100%), drop technique (81%), passive modalities (65%), soft tissue manipulation (13%), flexion-distraction (13%), and mechanical traction (13%). Mean posttreatment NPRS was 0.6±1.0; ODI was 2.4±3.3%. All patients had a minimum clinically important difference for NPRS (≥2/10) and ODI (≥30%). One year after treatment, 48% maintained improvement, 42% experienced recurrence; in 10%, follow-up was unavailable. Regression analysis identified younger age, shorter symptom duration, and greater baseline NPRS as predictors of NPRS reduction; and greater baseline ODI as a predictor of ODI reduction (all P 0.05).

38,2019,35485660,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,"Underwater traction of the spine is a physiotherapeutic method that combines the effects of mechanical traction and fresh water of indifferent temperature and seems promising for the treatment of pain in the lower back, which is due to the physiological basis of the mechanism of action on the spinal motion segment by eliminating muscle spasm and restoring the biomechanics of the spine. Objective: To study the effectiveness of underwater horizontal traction in combination with mechanotherapy in patients with non-stenosing unstable degenerative spondylolisthesis of the lumbosacral spine of the 1st degree, accompanied by pain. Material and methods: The clinical study included 14 patients (mean age 50.21 years). Patients underwent underwater horizontal traction of the spine according to the modified Pushkareva-Vozdvizhenskaya method in a variable mode, the procedures were performed every other day, for a course of 6 procedures. After completion of the traction procedure, patients were recommended to put on a fixing lumbosacral corset, in which they rested for 30 minutes in the supine position. At the end of the rest period, the patients performed training of the back muscles with biofeedback on the mechanotherapeutic complex of simulators for 30 minutes daily, except for weekends, for a course of 10 procedures. Results: All patients completed the course of treatment, during the procedures no side effects or deterioration were noted. During the treatment, motor and daily activity significantly improved according to the Oswestry scale ( p =0.002), the severity of the pain syndrome and its effect on the patient's activity decreased, according to the Roland-Morris questionnaire ( p =0.003). According to an objective assessment of the muscle strength of the lumbosacral spine at the initial level, no deviations from the normative parameters were revealed, however, during the treatment, a significant increase in strength was noted in all muscle groups. Conclusion: Underwater horizontal traction of the spine in variable mode according to Pushkareva-Vozdvizhenskaya is an effective and safe method of conservative treatment of unstable non-stenosing degenerative spondylolisthesis of the 1st degree, accompanied by back pain, which helps to reduce the intensity of the pain syndrome and improve the daily motor and social activity of patients.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 78 patients with low back pain and radicular pain admitted to the Department of Orthopedics of Beijing Chuiyangliu Hospital from March, 2017 to April, 2019. Thirty-three of the patients received treatment with LTEB (LTEB group), and 45 received comprehensive conservative treatment including traction, massage, acupuncture and physiotherapy (control group). The demographic and clinical data of the two groups were compared. The patients were followed up for 3 to 24 months, and numerical rating scale (NRS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores of the patients were evaluated before the treatment and at 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after discharge to assess the efficacy of the treatment. Results: The mean operation time of LTEB was 25.7 7.5 min (15-45 min). After the operation, 5 patients developed weakness of the lower limbs but all recovered within 24-72 h. The patients receiving LTEB all showed significantly decreased NRS scores for low back and radicular pain and ODI scores after the operation ( P =0.001). At 2 weeks after the operation, the patients receiving LTEB showed significant relief of low back pain as compared with the patients in the control group ( t =2.224, P =0.034), and the difference in NRS scores for low back pain between the two groups tended to diminish over time ( F =1.743, P =0.183). Treatment with LTEB resulted in obvious relief of radicular pain and significant reduction of the ODI score of the patients ( P 0.001), and such improvements became more obvious over time after LTEB ( P 0.01). Conclusions: As a minimally invasive approach, LTEB is effective for treatment of low back pain with radicular pain and can produce good short-term effects of pain relief and functional improvement.",0.9998700618743896

Method: A literature search started in September 2016 to retrieve systematic reviews and individual RCTs of lumbar traction. The term ""lumbar traction"" and other key words were used in the following databases: Cochrane Registry, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. The retrieved systematic reviews were used to extract individual RCTs. The most current systematic review included RCTs from inception until August 2012. We performed an additional literature search to update this systematic review with newer RCTs published between September 2012 and December 2016. All of the identified RCTs were combined and summarized into a single evidence table. Results: We identified a total of 37 traction RCTs that varied greatly in their method of traction intervention. The RCTs included several types of traction: mechanical (57%), auto-traction (16%), manual (10.8%), gravitational (8.1%) and aquatic (5.4%). There was also great variability in the types of traction force, rhythm, session duration and treatment frequency used in the RCTs. Patient characteristics were a mixture of acute, subacute and chronic LBP; with or without sciatica. Conclusion: There is wide variability in the type of traction, traction parameters and patient characteristics found among the RCTs of lumbar traction. The variability may call into question the conclusion that lumbar traction has little no or value on clinical outcomes. Also, this variability emphasizes the need for targeted delivery methods of traction that match appropriate dosages with specific subgroups of patients with LBP.",0.0002649874077178538

[Participants and Methods] Two young adult males reported suffering from chronic low back pain associated with anterior sagittal balance and severe loss of lumbar lordosis, aka 'flat back syndrome.' Lumbar extension traction was applied 3-5 times per week for 16.5-20 weeks. A torsion type lumbar spinal manipulative therapy was provided in the initial 3 weeks for short-term pain relief. [Results] Both patients had dramatic improvement in lumbar lordosis with simultaneous reduction in pain levels. One patient had a 50° lordosis improvement in 100 treatments over 20 weeks; the other had a 26° lordosis improvement in 70 treatments over 16.5 weeks. There were also improvements in sacral base angle, pelvic tilt and sagittal balance. One patient demonstrated stability of health status and further improvements in radiographic measures including lordosis angle nearly 10-months post-treatment. [Conclusion] This is the first successful non-operative correction of flat back syndrome. This approach seems highly effective, is a fraction of the cost of spinal surgery typically used to treat this condition, and offers no health risks including those assumed from radiography necessary for screening and follow-up.",0.9998729228973389
38,2019,29201301,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,"Background: The traction bed is a noninvasive device for treating lower back pain caused by herniated intervertebral discs. In this study, we investigated the impact of the traction bed on the lower back as a means of increasing the disc height and creating a gap between facet joints. Methods: Computed tomography (CT) images were obtained from a female volunteer and a three-dimensional (3D) model was created using software package MIMICs 17.0. Afterwards, the 3D model was analyzed in an analytical software (Abaqus 6.14). The study was conducted under the following traction loads: 25%, 45%, 55%, and 85% of the whole body weight in different angles. Results: Results indicated that the loading angle in the L3-4 area had 36.8%, 57.4%, 55.32%, 49.8%, and 52.15% effect on the anterior longitudinal ligament, posterior longitudinal ligament, intertransverse ligament, interspinous ligament, and supraspinous ligament, respectively. The respective values for the L4-5 area were 32.3%, 10.6%, 53.4%, 56.58%, and 57.35%. Also, the body weight had 63.2%, 42.6%, 44.68%, 50.2%, and 47.85% effect on the anterior longitudinal ligament, posterior longitudinal ligament, intertransverse ligament, interspinous ligament, and supraspinous ligament, respectively. The respective values for the L4-5 area were 67.7%, 89.4%, 46.6%, 43.42% and 42.65%. The authenticity of results was checked by comparing with the experimental data. Conclusions: The results show that traction beds are highly effective for disc movement and lower back pain relief. Also, an optimal angle for traction can be obtained in a 3D model analysis using CT or magnetic resonance imaging images. The optimal angle would be different for different patients and thus should be determined based on the decreased height of the intervertebral disc, weight and height of patients.",0.9998900890350342

Methods: A total of twenty patients diagnosed as LHNP and suffering from pain at least 8 weeks were enrolled to the study. Patients were allocated in study (SG) and control groups (CG) randomly. Both groups received combination of electrotherapy, deep friction massage and stabilization exercise for fifteen session. SG received additionally NSDT different from CG. Numeric Anolog Scale, Straight leg raise test, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were applied at baseline and after treatment. Disc height and herniation thickness were measured on Magnetic Resonance Imagination which performed at baseline and three months after therapy. Results: Both treatments had positive effect for improving pain, functional restoration and reduction in thickness of herniation. Although reduction of herniation size was higher in SG than CG, no significant differences were found between groups and any superiority to each other (p&gt; 0.05). Conclusions: This study showed that patients with LHNP received physiotherapy had improvement based on clinical and radiologic evidence.

Therefore, we aimed to comprehensively evaluate and quantitatively rank various pharmacological therapies for patients with low back pain. Two meta-analyses were performed: an initial pair-wise meta-analysis, followed by network meta-analysis using a random-effects Bayesian model. We included randomized controlled trials comparing placebos, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, skeletal muscular relaxants, pregabalin (or gabapentin), and some drug combinations. The primary and secondary outcomes were pain intensity and physical function. Eighty-eight eligible trials with 21,377 patients were included. Here, we show that only skeletal muscle relaxants significantly decreased the pain intensity of acute (including subacute) low back pain. Several kinds of drugs significantly decreased the pain of chronic low back pain, but only opioids and cyclo-oxygenase 2-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs effectively reduced pain and improved function. Pregabalin (or gabapentin) seemed to be an effective treatment to relieve pain, but it should be used with caution for low back pain.",0.9998499155044556

In this study, enantioselectivity for carbonyl reduction of eperisone was investigated in human liver microsomes, and the enzymes involved in the carbonyl reduction were characterised. Carbonyl reduction of eperisone predominantly occurred in microsomal fractions and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1(11β-HSD 1) played a major role in this reaction as judged by selective inhibition of the activity by BVT-14225 and KR-66344. The kinetic study with (+)-S- and (-)-R-eperisone showed that the formation of the carbonyl reduced metabolite (M5) from the (-)-R-isomer was more efficient than that from the (-)-S-isomer. As eperisone is a racemic compound with one chiral centre, the carbonyl reduced metabolite of eperisone (M5) may have four possible diastereoisomeric structures. Chiral separation of incubation mixtures of racemic eperisone with human liver microsome revealed that (1S, 2S)-M5 and (1R, 2R)-M5 were generated specifically from (+)-S- and (-)-R-eperisone, respectively. Selective formation of anti-diastereomers was further confirmed by incubation of individual enantiomer with microsomes. Carbonyl reduction of eperisone by microsomal 11β-HSD 1 may significantly contribute to the metabolic disposition of eperisone in human and (-)-R-isomer is preferentially reduced by this enzyme.",0.9999083280563354

However, oral eperisone has a very low bioavailability and short muscle relaxant activity, because of the profound intestinal first-pass metabolism. To improve the efficacy and compliance of eperisone, we designed a new dosage form, a transdermal patch, and evaluated the efficacy of the eperisone patch with the muscle relaxant activity of rats. The muscle relaxant activity was assessed by the measurement of forelimb grip strength and hanging test in rats. The transdermal patch of eperisone showed significantly enhanced muscle relaxant activity at 0.5 1.5 and 3 cm2/200 g rat (1.39, 4.17 and 8.33 mg of eperisone hydrochloride/kg, respectively) in a dose-dependent manner and the effects lasted over 24 h. Even though oral eperisone hydrochloride showed significant muscle relaxant activity at 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg in a dose-dependent manner, the activity lasted only 1 or 2 h after administration.

The treatments currently used have not worked as expected. Alternative and complementary medicines were inserted in health services, especially in primary care, as an attempt to minimize risks and help control diseases such as diabetes. Among the herbal medicines used stands out cinnamon, which can serve as an adjuvant in the control of diabetes. Objective: To analyze the effectiveness of 3 grams of cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) per day for 90 days in reducing glycemic and lipid levels in adults with T2DM compared with placebo METHODS:: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial, which will be conducted at basic health units in the city of Parnaíba, state of Piauí, Brazil. In total, 130 people diagnosed with T2DM, followed at health units, with hemoglobin A1c &gt; 6.5%, and using oral antidiabetic medicines, are expected to participate in the study. The intervention will last for 3 months, and each participant will receive a total of 3 bottles containing 120 capsules in each bottle of cinnamon or placebo. Each person should take 4 capsules daily, for 90 days. The patients will be distributed into the 2 groups by performing block randomization (n = 6) at a ratio of 1:1 according to a code generated by a software. Assessments of socioeconomic, clinical, lifestyle, anthropometric, and laboratory variables will be performed in 2 separate visits. Discussion: This study will be the first to investigate cinnamon to reduce glycemic, lipid, and anthropometric levels in Brazil. In case of favorable results, this therapy may be used as an alternative or additional medicine in cases where only oral antidiabetic agents are used and can promote the use of the product to minimize future complications of patients with diabetes and people who do not have the disease.

40,2019,25249234,Can cinnamon help people with diabetes?,cinnamon diabetes,0.0,"Background: Postprandial hyperglycemia is a known risk factor for the development of several health disorders including type 2 diabetes, obesity, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular diseases. One encouraging approach for a better control of postprandial glycemia is to reduce carbohydrate digestion. Cinnamon extracts have been known for managing blood glucose. However, their effects on inhibiting digestion of carbohydrate have been poorly analyzed to date. The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effect of a specific Ceylon cinnamon hydro-alcoholic extract (CCE) on carbohydrate digestion and post-meal blood glucose reduction. Methods: In vitro enzymatic assays and in vivo starch tolerance tests in rats were designed as preclinical assays. Then, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over clinical trial was conducted in 18 healthy female and male volunteers. Following the intake of 1 g of CCE, the subjects ate a standardized meal. Blood samples were collected during the 2 hours following the meal to measure glucose and insulin concentrations. Areas under the curves were calculated and statistical differences between the CCE and placebo groups were analyzed using the Mann Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Results: CCE has demonstrated in the in vitro study that it inhibited pancreatic alpha-amylase activity with an IC50 of 25 μg/mL. In the in vivo study, CCE was shown to acutely reduce the glycemic response to starch in a dose-dependent manner in rats. This effect was significant from the dose of 12.5 mg/kg of body weight. In both, the in vitro and in vivo studies, the hydro-alcoholic extract has shown to be more efficacious than the aqueous extract. In the human clinical trial, 1 g of CCE lowered the area under the curve of glycemia between 0 and 120 min by 14.8% (P = 0.15) and between 0 and 60 min by 21.2% (P 0.05) compared to the placebo. This effect occurred without stimulating insulin secretion. No adverse effects were reported. Conclusion: These results suggest that Ceylon cinnamon hydro-alcoholic extract (CCE) may provide a natural and safe solution for the reduction of postprandial hyperglycemia and therefore help to reduce the risks of developing metabolic disorders.

Improvements in glycaemic control may help to reduce the risk of these complications. Several animal studies show that cinnamon may be effective in improving glycaemic control. While these effects have been explored in humans also, findings from these studies have not yet been systematically reviewed. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of cinnamon in patients with diabetes mellitus. Search methods: Pertinent randomised controlled trials were identified through AARP Ageline, AMED, AMI, BioMed Central gateway, CAM on PubMed, CINAHL, Dissertations Abstracts International, EMBASE, Health Source Nursing/Academic edition, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, Natural medicines comprehensive database, The Cochrane Library and TRIP database. Clinical trial registers and the reference lists of included trials were searched also (all up to January 2012). Content experts and manufacturers of cinnamon extracts were also contacted. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of orally administered monopreparations of cinnamon (Cinnamomum spp.) to placebo, active medication or no treatment in persons with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and trial quality, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing information. Main results: Ten prospective, parallel-group design, randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 577 participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, were identified. Risk of bias was high or unclear in all but two trials, which were assessed as having moderate risk of bias. Risk of bias in some domains was high in 50% of trials. Oral monopreparations of cinnamon (predominantly Cinnamomum cassia) were administered at a mean dose of 2 g daily, for a period ranging from 4 to 16 weeks. The effect of cinnamon on fasting blood glucose level was inconclusive. No statistically significant difference in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum insulin or postprandial glucose was found between cinnamon and control groups. There were insufficient data to pool results for insulin sensitivity. No trials reported health-related quality of life, morbidity, mortality or costs. Adverse reactions to oral cinnamon were infrequent and generally mild in nature. Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cinnamon for type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Further trials, which address the issues of allocation concealment and blinding, are now required. The inclusion of other important endpoints, such as health-related quality of life, diabetes complications and costs, is also needed.",0.9894860982894897

This chapter gives an overview of existing primary prevention programs on environmental exposures and dietary strategies based on epidemiological studies which have defined risk- and protective factors for the development of allergic diseases.The allergy protective effect mediated by growing up on a traditional farm environment is well studied. But the exact underlying mechanisms have still not been fully clarified and have not yet led to concrete prevention strategies. The beneficial effect of avoiding cigarette smoke exposure, indoor moisture and molds in pregnancy and childhood on the development of asthma is well documented. Whereas the avoidance of house dust mite exposure is not recommended to prevent eczema or allergy. Dietary supplementation with vitamins, pre- and probiotics in pregnant woman and their offspring is not harmful but evidence for the prevention of allergic diseases is still lacking. Fish oil consumption was shown to be asthma protective. The early introduction of peanuts and egg protein to prevent peanut and egg allergy in children with atopic dermatitis is promising. Further studies are needed to increase the overall evidence in allergy prevention. Most studies lack methodological standards such as randomization and blinding.

The health benefits are strain specific and could be due to the produced polysaccharides. The consumption of probiotics may prevent obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, eczema or atopic dermatitis, and asthma. Non-replicative strains of Bifidobacterium longum (NCC3001 and NCC2705) promote the differentiation of normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs), inducing a high expression of differentiation markers (keratin -KRT1-, and transglutaminase -TGM1-) and pro-regeneration markers (cathepsins), including β-defensin-1, which plays an important role in modulating the cutaneous immune response. Strains belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus can increase tight-junction proteins in NHEKs and enhance barrier function. Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli may be used as prophylactic or therapeutic agents towards enteric pathogens, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, lactose intolerance, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer, cholesterol reduction, and control of obesity and metabolic disorders. Bifidobacterium bifidum showed an in vitro capability of lowering cholesterol levels thanks to its absorption into the bacterial membrane. Several strains of the species Lactobacillus acidophilus , L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus , L. casei , and L. gasseri led to a reduced amount of serum cholesterol due to their ability to assimilate cholesterol (in vitro).

42,2019,33811784,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,"Background: Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic skin disease affecting the pediatric population. Probiotics have been proposed to be effective in preventing the development of pediatric atopic dermatitis. Although studies show promise for the use of probiotics, the evidence is still inconclusive due to significant heterogeneity and imprecision. Objective: To determine the comparative effectiveness of the different types of probiotic strains in preventing the development of atopic dermatitis among pediatric patients. Methodology: A systematic search of Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, TRIP Database, and Centre for Research and Dissemination was conducted. Manual search of the reference lists and search for unpublished articles were also done. All randomized controlled trials available from inception until April 12, 2020, on the use of probiotics in the prevention of atopic dermatitis among children were included. The comparator groups considered are other probiotic strains and placebo. The primary outcome of interest was the development of atopic dermatitis. Two authors independently searched for articles, screened the articles for inclusion, appraised the articles using the Cochrane risk of bias tool version 2, and extracted the data. In case of disagreement, the two authors discussed the source of disagreement until consensus was reached. If consensus was not reached, an independent third party reviewer was consulted. Frequentist network meta-analysis was conducted using STATA 14 software. The ranking probabilities and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values were obtained to determine ranking of the different probiotic strains based on efficacy and safety data. Results: We included 21 original studies represented by 35 records and a total of 5406 children with atopic dermatitis as diagnosed by clinicians or fulfillment of validated diagnostic criteria. All studies were randomized placebo-controlled trials. The top 3 probiotic preparations in terms of efficacy in reducing the risk of atopic dermatitis are Mix8 (Lactobacillus paracasei ST11, Bifidobacterium longum BL999), LP (Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19) and Mix3 (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium animalis ssp lactis Bb-12). Mix8 compared with placebo probably reduces the risk of atopic dermatitis based on low-quality evidence (RR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.85). Mix3 compared with placebo also probably reduces the risk of atopic dermatitis based on low-quality evidence (RR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.94). It is uncertain whether LP compared with placebo reduces the risk of atopic dermatitis due to very-low-quality certainty of evidence (RR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.20-1.19). In terms of adverse events, LGG may slightly lead to less adverse events compared with placebo based on low-quality evidence (RR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.32-1.52). Mix4 may slightly lead to more adverse events compared with placebo based on low-quality evidence (RR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.02-51.88). Based on subgroup analysis of studies involving infants, Mix3 compared with placebo probably reduces the risk of atopic dermatitis based on low-quality evidence (RR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.22-0.97). In the subgroup analysis of studies where probiotics were administered to pregnant women and to infants, LRH compared with placebo probably reduces the risk of atopic dermatitis based on moderate-quality evidence (RR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.26-1.11). Conclusion: Certain probiotic preparations demonstrate efficacy in reducing the risk of developing atopic dermatitis when administered to pregnant women, infants, or both.",0.0014777951873838902
42,2019,32530339,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic and recurrent skin disease during infancy. Objective: This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of synbiotic and vitamin D3 supplements on the severity of AD among infants under 1 year of age. Methods: This double-blind, randomized clinical trial study was conducted on 81 subjects with AD in Sabzevar, Iran in 2018. Subjects were randomly assigned to three groups. Synbiotic group was administered a dose of five drops/day of synbiotic in addition to routine treatment. Vitamin D3 group was administered 1000 units (IU) of vitamin D3 daily in addition to routine treatment. Control group just received routine treatments. The severity of AD was evaluated using SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) at baseline and two months' follow-up. Results: The mean age of subjects was 4.87 ± 3.5 and 59.26% ( n = 48) were male. The mean SCOARD scores were substantially decreased in the synbiotic ( b xy : -13.90, 95% CI, -20.99, -6.81; p .001) and vitamin D3 ( b xy : -12.38, 95% CI, -19.33, -5.43; p = .001) groups as compared to control one by the end of two months.

We evaluated the effect of a postnatal probiotic combination on development of allergic diseases in very preterm infants. Methods: This sub-study was an a priori secondary outcome of the ProPrems multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (ANZCTR:12607000144415). ProPrems randomized 1099 very preterm infants to receive a probiotic combination or placebo from soon after birth until discharge from hospital or term corrected age (CA), whichever was earlier. Allergic disease (eczema, atopic eczema, food allergy, wheeze, atopic sensitization) was assessed in a subgroup of ProPrems infants (n = 281) as close to 12 months CA as possible by questionnaire, clinical examination, and skin prick tests to common allergens. Results: There was no difference in eczema incidence between the probiotic and placebo groups (35[30%] of 118 infants vs 37[27%] of 137 infants, respectively, absolute difference 2.65%, 95% CI -8.45 to 13.75). Similarly, the incidence of atopic eczema (6[5%] of 118 vs 3[2%] of 137), food allergy (4[3%] of 124 vs 2[1%] of 154), wheeze (39[31%] of 127 vs 45[29%] of 154), and atopic sensitization (14[13%] of 106 vs 13[11%] of 123) were similar between the probiotic and placebo groups. Conclusion: This study found no effect of postnatal administration of a probiotic combination on the incidence of allergic diseases or atopic sensitization in the first 2 years of life in children born very preterm. Evidence that probiotics are effective for prevention of allergic disease in premature infants remains lacking; adequately powered randomized controlled trials evaluating probiotic supplementation for allergy prevention in very preterm infants are needed.",0.0006686105625703931

Methods: Decision modelling was undertaken to estimate the probability of IgE-mediated cow's milk allergic infants being symptom free (i.e. not experiencing urticaria, eczema, asthma or rhinoconjunctivitis) and developing tolerance to cow's milk by 5 years. The model also estimated the cost (at 2016/2017 prices) of healthcare resource use funded by the UK's National Health Service (NHS) over 5 years after starting a formula, as well as the relative cost-effectiveness of the two dietary formulae. Results: At 5 years after the start of a formula the probability of being symptom free was estimated to be 0.97 and 0.76 among infants who were originally fed eHCF plus LGG and an eHCF alone, respectively. This encompassed the probability of children being asthma free at 5 years after the start of treatment, which was 0.99 and 0.91 in the eHCF plus LGG and eHCF alone groups, respectively. Additionally, the probability of acquiring tolerance to cow's milk was estimated to be 0.94 and 0.66 among infants who were originally fed eHCF plus LGG and an eHCF alone, respectively. The estimated total healthcare cost over 5 years of initially feeding infants with eHCF plus LGG was less than that of feeding infants with an eHCF alone (£4229 versus £5136 per patient). Conclusions: First-line management of newly diagnosed infants with IgE-mediated CMPA with eHCF plus LGG instead of an eHCF alone improves outcome, releases healthcare resources for alternative use, reduces the NHS cost of patient management and thereby affords a cost-effective dietetic strategy to the NHS.",0.9997864365577698

For some of these patients, epilepsy surgery may provide freedom from seizures. However, in many cases, epilepsy surgery is not a viable treatment option. Nonpharmacological approaches are a useful adjunct to help manage seizures in these children. This review examines the role of vagus nerve stimulation, the ketogenic diet, and various forms of EEG biofeedback therapy in children with intractable epilepsy. Although the mechanism of action is not known precisely for any of these adjunctive therapies, they add an important and evolving dimension to the management of difficult to control epilepsy in children.

45,2019,32718189,Can caffeine help people with asthma?,caffeine asthma,1.0,"Objectives: Despite the rapid increase in electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) smoking, little is known about the factors associated with their use, particularly in adolescents with asthma. Our study investigated the prevalence of, and factors associated with asthma. Methods: We analyzed data from the Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey of 44,479 adolescents with physician-diagnosed asthma and 445,692 subjects without asthma. Sociodemographic factors, psychosocial factors, and e-cigarette smoking patterns were investigated by self-report questionnaires. Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate the factors associated with ever or current e-cigarette risks in adolescents with asthma, with adjustment for confounding factors. Results: Significantly more subjects had a smoking habit in the asthma group than in the non-asthma group. Among the adolescents with asthma, 4,420 (9.9%) smoked e-cigarettes (ever-users), and 1,962 (4.4%) smoked e-cigarettes within the last 30 days (current users). Multiple logistic regression showed that both ever and current e-cigarette use were significantly associated with male gender, higher family income, residence in an urban area, alcohol drinking, substance use experience, sexual experience, and friends' smoking. Current e-cigarette use was also significantly associated with high caffeine intake, no regular exercise, and experience of violence in adolescents with asthma. Conclusions: E-cigarette smoking behavior was significantly more frequent in adolescents with asthma than in those without asthma, and multiple psychosocial factors were associated with e-cigarette smoking. Our results could inform e-smoking control programs and help identify adolescents with asthma at high risk of e-cigarette smoking, to ultimately prevent and reduce this behavior.",0.9985288381576538

47,2019,34020879,Can insoles treat back pain?,insoles back pain,0.0,"Background: Increased foot pronation during walking has been associated with low back pain. This association may be due to the impact of increased pronation on pelvic motion. Objective: To investigate the effects of increased bilateral foot pronation on pelvic kinematic in frontal and transverse planes during the loading response phase of gait. Methods: Pelvic, hip, and foot angular positions of 20 participants were collected while they walked at fast speed wearing flat and medially inclined insoles inserted in the shoes. Pelvic motion in frontal and transverse planes was analyzed during the loading response phase. Foot eversion-inversion was analyzed during the complete stance phase to verify the insoles effectiveness in inducing increased pronation and to exclude excessive pronators. Results: Inclined insoles were effective in inducing increased foot pronation. Pelvic and hip motion were altered in the increased pronation condition compared to the control condition. In the frontal plane, mean pelvic position was more inclined to the contralateral side (mean difference [MD]: 0.54°; 95%CI: 0.23, 0.86) and its range of motion (ROM) was reduced (MD: 0.50°; 95%CI: 0.20, 0.79). In the transverse plane, mean pelvic position was less rotated toward the contralateral leg (MD: 1.03°; 95%CI: 0.65, 1.60) without changes in ROM (MD: 0.04°; 95%CI: -0.17, 0.25).

We reviewed common rearfoot disorders and present conservative treatments, focusing on shoe modification and the application of insoles or orthoses. Achilles tendinopathy is caused by excessive mechanical loads on the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Heel lifts, rocker shoes, and the AirHeel Brace can be used to reduce symptoms. Haglund's deformity is an osseous prominence of the posterosuperior part of the calcaneus bone, the pain from which can be alleviated by reducing pressure on the affected area by appropriately modifying the back of the shoe to prevent contact with the lesion. The pain from retrocalcaneal bursitis can be controlled by lifting the heel and loosening the shoe counter. Plantar fasciitis causes plantar heel pain, and its orthotic treatments include the application of a heel cup, heel pad, heel wedge, Thomas heel, and night splint. Calcaneal stress fractures are generally caused by repetitive loads and occur mainly in sporting activities. Patellar tendon-bearing (PTB) orthoses are helpful in reducing the load on the calcaneal bone. Heel fat pad atrophy refers to the loss of the fat pad that absorbs shock in the heel. To reduce pain caused by heel fat pad atrophy, rocker soles, heel pads, and solid ankle cushion heels (SACHs) may be used. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the tibial nerve within the tarsal tunnel and its symptoms can be managed by rocker soles, supporting medial arches, Thomas heels, and SACHs. Shoe modification or application of orthoses can be helpful for managing rearfoot pain. However, for the active and wide application of these conservative treatment methods, more clinical studies should be conducted.",0.9994230270385742

Currently, the literature is lacking information on the effect of spinal fusion on both postural stability and its association with back pain. Our objectives were to evaluate the postsurgical effect of spinal morphological changes on static standing balance and assess the influence of these alterations on reported pain throughout the perioperative period. Methods: Twenty consecutive AIS patients schedule to undergo spinal fusion surgery were recruited and followed prospectively at the Shriners Hospitals for Children-Canada. Data was collected at the preoperative, 6 weeks and 6 months postoperative visits. Spinal morphology data was collected through 3D reconstructed simultaneous standing biplanar radiographs using the SterEOS software. Postural balance was assessed through Moticon© sensor insoles and analyzed through their software. The data was simultaneously collected as part of the Global Biomechanical and morphological Assessment. Pain was evaluated through self-reported questionnaires. Results: Morphological curve parameters were significantly reduced after surgery. Balance parameters did not change significantly throughout the perioperative period with the exception of the Center of Pressure of the left foot medial/lateral transient shift (P = 0.017) at 6 weeks. Of note, preoperative balance parameters were associated with the degree of right thoracic Cobb angles (P = 0.029 R = 0.528). Pain scores significantly improved 6 weeks and 6 months after the surgery. Pain intensity diminished in the thoracic and lumbar spine but worsen in the neck region at the 6 weeks and 6 months postoperative time points (P = 0.044). Greater residual Cobb angle difference between Mid thoracic and Thoracolumbar/Lumbar curves was associated with greater pain severity at 6 weeks postop (P 0.005). In addition, greater residual thoracic deformity was associated with significant pain severity 6 months after surgery (P 0.05). Conclusions: Improved spinal morphology of postsurgical AIS patients has no significant impact on their static standing balance. Suggesting that other factors apart from the spinal morphology may contribute to AIS patients' balance during stance. Although balance did not influence pain severity, spinal morphology and its correction appear to have influenced the intensity and location of back pain.",0.0010431264527142048

LBP is common and causes a remarkable health burden worldwide. Leg-length discrepancy (LLD) is potentially a risk factor for development of LBP, although this relationship has been questioned. Yet only one randomized controlled study (RCT) has been performed. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of insoles with leg-length discrepancy (LLD) correction compared to insoles without LLD correction among meat cutters in a RCT-design. Methods: The study population consisted 387 meat cutters who were over 35 years old and had been working 10 years or more. The LLD measurement was done by a laser ultrasound technique. All workers with an LLD of at least 5 mm and an LBP intensity of at least 2 on a 10-cm Visual Analog Scale were eligible. The LLD of all the participants in the intervention group was corrected 70%, which means that if the LLD was for example 10 mm the correction was 7 mm. The insoles were used at work for eight hours per day. The control group had insoles without LLD correction. The primary outcome was between-group difference in LBP intensity. Secondary outcomes included sciatic pain intensity, disability (Roland Morris), RAND-36, the Oswestry Disability Index, physician visits and days on sick leave over the first year. We used a repeated measures regression analysis with adjustments for age, gender and BMI. The hurdle model was used for days on sick leave. Results: In all, 169 workers were invited and 114 (67%) responded. Of them, 42 were eligible and were randomized to the intervention (n = 20) or control group (n = 22). The workers in the intervention group had a higher improvement in LBP intensity (- 2.6; 95% confidence intervals - 3.7 - - 1.4), intensity of sciatic pain (- 2.3; - 3.4 - - 1.07) and RAND-36 physical functioning (9.6; 1.6-17.6) and a lesser likelihood of sick leaves (OR -3.7; - 7.2 - -0.2).

Methods: An electronic literature search was performed in Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Published peer-reviewed systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which described interventions for the primary or secondary prevention of LBP applicable to a workplace setting, were eligible for inclusion. The methodological quality of the included systematic reviews was assessed with the AMSTAR tool. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of LBP; secondary outcomes were LBP-associated absenteeism, activity interference, and costs related to LBP. Results: Twenty-eight eligible articles published between 1994 and 2016 were included in a qualitative synthesis following our screening of abstracts and full-text articles. The AMSTAR rating revealed 14 reviews of high, 10 of moderate, and 4 of low methodological quality. The identified interventions included workplace modifications (6 reviews, 10 studies, 6,751 subjects); shoe insoles (4 reviews, 6 studies, 2,356 subjects); and lumbar supports and other assistive devices (15 reviews, 18 studies, 60,678 subjects).

Exercise interventions, investigated in 12 reviews (35 studies, 19,330 subjects), showed moderate quality evidence of effectiveness for exercise interventions alone or in conjunction with educational interventions; no other type of intervention was consistently effective in the prevention of LBP or LBP-associated outcomes of interest. Conclusions: Our overview provides evidence of effectiveness for exercise with or without educational interventions in the prevention of LBP. Practical applications: Exercise interventions with or without educational interventions that can be applied in the workplace have the potential to prevent LBP.",0.9998416900634766

Research question
 The aim of the present investigation is to identify current, topic-relevant, evidence-based guidelines, extract their recommendations and designate those recommendations that are relevant for the care of patients in a disease management programme (DMP) “chronic back pain”. Conclusion 
On the basis of a “Grade of Recommendation” (GoR) or alternatively a “Level of Evidence” (LoE) of the extracted recommendations from current evidence-based guidelines, relevant and potentially relevant recommendations on all prespecified healthcare aspects were identified for a DMP “chronic back pain”, with the exception of the healthcare aspect “treatment goals”. These commonly referred to recommendations advising against the use of a measure (negative recommendation). The guidelines provide recommendations on diagnostics (standardized recording of symptoms, recording of psychosocial risk factors, imaging procedures, blood tests, diagnostic nerve blocks) and on recurrence prophylaxis (physical activity, shoe insoles and orthoses [negative recommendation], lumbar support belts [negative recommendation]). For non-drug measures, recommendations were identified on massages and manual therapy, exercise and physiotherapy, as well as aqua gymnastics and yoga. Furthermore, negative recommendations were found on bed rest, behavioural therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS), device- supported traction treatment, orthoses, short-wave diathermy, therapeutic ultrasound, as well as on interference, magnetic field, and laser therapy. The recommendations on drug therapy referred to oral analgesics such as flupirtine (negative recommendation), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs (negative recommendation), the additional administration of proton pump inhibitors, as well as intravenous or intramuscular administration of pain medication (negative recommendation). For invasive therapy, recommendations were identified on joint injections (negative recommendation), proliferation therapy (negative recommendation), and counselling about surgical treatment options. Recommendations were also identified on the healthcare aspects of patient training, rehabilitation measures, and cooperation of healthcare sectors. Inconsistent recommendations were identified on discography, non-drug therapy with acupuncture, as well as drug therapy with paracetamol and phytotherapeutics; these were proposed for further evaluation of their DMP relevance. In addition, specific recommendations were identified for different patient subgroups (patients with radiculopathy and/or disc-related back pain, spinal canal stenosis, post-nucleotomy syndrome, lumbar facet joint pain, sacroiliac joint pain).",0.9966604709625244
49,2019,36130027,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune disease that can affect the entire body.<sup>,</sup> RA is characterized by inflammation in the lining of the joints and other tissue, causing swelling, pain, and stiffness, which can lead to permanent joint damage. RA is a debilitating chronic disease and people with RA are often at a higher risk of mortality because of associated comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease.<sup>,</sup> In Canada, approximately 374,000 people aged 16 or older are currently living with diagnosed RA and approximately 1% of the global population is affected by RA. The prevalence and incidence of diagnosed RA generally increases with age and females in Canada are more likely to experience diagnosed RA compared to males. There is no cure for RA; however, early diagnosis and treatment can play a large role in reducing symptoms, preventing lasting joint damage, and reducing the risk of developing comorbidities.<sup>,</sup> Early treatment for RA (e.g., as soon as a patient is diagnosed) can mean that disease remission is more likely. A “treat-to-target” strategy is often used in RA management, where the target for patient treatment is remission or low disease activity when remission is not possible. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are commonly used course in the treatment for RA because they slow disease progression and provide symptom relief. RA treatment regimens can consist of conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs), biologic DMARDs, or targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs). Common csDMARDs include methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide (LEF), sulfasalazine (SSZ), and antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Biologic DMARDs usually include either tumour necrosis factor inhibitors or non-tumour necrosis factor inhibitors. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are a commonly used tsDMARD in advanced RA treatment. csDMARDs were the first DMARD agents approved for RA treatment, are the most commonly prescribed treatment for RA, and are typically the least expensive. csDMARD monotherapy is typically the first course of treatment for newly diagnosed individuals. However, if disease progression continues, then additional csDMARDs may be added as a “step-up” approach, followed by adding or switching to biologic DMARDs or JAK inhibitors if disease progression does not slow down.<sup>,</sup> Glucocorticoids are also commonly used on a short-term basis in the treatment of RA. Glucocorticoids, which have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, may also be used as an adjunct therapy when a patient is starting a new DMARD treatment or changing from one DMARD to another. DMARD therapy for the treatment and management of RA has shown to be effective in providing symptom relief and slowing disease progression; however, there are a variety of treatment approaches that may be used to manage RA disease progression and evidence-based guidance is helpful in determining the best course of action for patients with RA. The purpose of this report is to review the evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of csDMARD therapy prior to the use of biologic DMARDs or JAK inhibitors. Evidence-based guidelines containing recommendations related to the use of csDMARDs, combination approaches for csDMARD therapy, csDMARD trial periods, and combining glucocorticoids with csDMARD therapy will be sought for this report and any relevant recommendations will be summarized.",0.9998623132705688

Methods: The clinical and genetic testing data of 3 children with HA20 treated at Capital Institute of Pediatrics (CIP) between August 2016 and October 2019 were retrospectively analysed. Result: Patient 1 presented with arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, patient 2 presented with axial spinal arthritis and lupus-like syndrome, and patient 3 presented with recurrent oral ulcers, gastrointestinal ulcers, and perianal abscesses. Regarding laboratory tests, patients were found to have elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The CRP and ESR was reported to be high in all the patients. The WBC was reported to be high in patient 1 and 3. Patient 2 was positive for antinuclear antibodies, anti-Sjögren's syndrome antigen A, dsDNA, rheumatoid factor and Coombs test. Genetic testing showed that all three patients had heterozygous mutation in TNFAIP3 gene. As for the treatment, patient 1 was treated with TNFα antagonist, patient 2 was treated with TNF α antagonist and sulfasalazine, and patient 3 was treated with corticosteroids and thalidomide. Patients 1 and 2 were followed for four and 3 months, respectively. There was an improvement in joint and gastrointestinal symptoms; inflammatory indices and rheumatoid factor (RF) were normal, and dsDNA and Coombs test became negative. Patient 3 was treated at another hospital and showed gradual improvement in oral ulcers and perianal abscesses. Conclusion: HA20 is a single-gene auto-inflammatory disease caused by mutation in tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) gene. It may present as Behçet-like syndrome and resemble various other autoimmune diseases as well. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents are effective treatments, and cytokine antagonists can be used in refractory cases. Whole-exome genetic testing should be proactively performed for children with early-age onset or Behçet-like syndrome to achieve early diagnosis and accurate treatment.",0.9997807145118713
49,2019,33682353,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,"Objective: To compare the real-life effectiveness of biologic therapy (a biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug plus methotrexate [MTX]) versus triple therapy (MTX plus sulfasalazine plus hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine) for sustained remission of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: RA patients who were registered in the nationwide Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register between 2000 and 2012 and were receiving biologic or triple therapy as a first treatment strategy after MTX monotherapy were included. Sustained remission was defined as a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) of 2.6 for ≥6 months (short-term sustained remission) or for ≥24 months (long-term sustained remission). Treatment groups were compared during treatment, at 1 year, and at 2 years for 1) all patients starting therapy and 2) patients continuing to receive therapy, using propensity score-adjusted regression analyses. In addition, survival analyses were used to compare treatment groups at any time during follow-up irrespective of therapy retention. Results: A total of 1,502 patients were included (1,155 receiving biologic therapy and 347 receiving triple therapy). For patients starting therapy, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of achieving short-term and long-term remission, respectively, at 1 year after start of biologic therapy versus triple therapy were 1.79 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.18-2.71) and 1.86 (95% CI 1.00-3.48). At 2 years, the ORs were 1.92 (95% CI 1.21-3.06) and 1.62 (95% CI 0.94-2.79), respectively. For patients continuing to receive therapy, corresponding results at 1 year were 1.12 (95% CI 0.72-1.75) and 1.1 (95% CI 0.59-2.16); at 2 years, 0.85 (95% CI 0.49-1.47) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.41-1.39). Hazard ratios for short-term and long-term sustained remission at any time during follow-up were 1.15 (95% CI 0.91-1.46) and 1.09 (95% CI 0.77-1.54), respectively. Conclusion: Among patients starting biologic or triple therapy, biologic therapy was more effective for remaining on therapy and achieving sustained remission. However, similar probabilities were found for achieving sustained remission among patients remaining on therapy and at any time during follow-up irrespective of therapy retention. Although the likelihood of reaching sustained remission is higher with biologic therapy, for certain RA patients triple therapy may still be an alternative to biologic therapy without hampering future chances of obtaining sustained remission.",0.9997907280921936
49,2019,33663487,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,"Background: Tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors (TNFi) is effective for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who fail to conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). Because of high cost, the discontinuation is common but often lead to disease relapse. The study aims to investigate, if the combination therapy of csDMARDs is more effective in reducing disease relapse than methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy, and more cost-effective than continuing TNFi and MTX. Methods: It will be a two-stage trial. In the first stage, all RA patients who failed to csDMARDs treatment [disease activity score 28 (DAS28)-CRP &gt; 3.2] will receive MTX plus TNFi for no more than 12 weeks. Patients achieving DAS28-CRP 3.2 during the first stage will be randomized into three groups at 1:1:1 ratio: (A) add hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and sulfasalazine (SSZ) for the first 12 weeks and then remove TNFi but continue other treatments for the next 48 weeks; (B) maintain TNFi + MTX for 60 weeks; and (C) maintain TNFi + MTX for the first 12 weeks and then remove TNFi but continue MTX monotherapy for the next 48 weeks. The primary outcome will be disease relapse (DAS28-CRP increases by at least 0.6 and &gt; 3.2). Secondary outcomes will include the incremental cost per reducing 1 case of relapse; patient reported intolerance to the treatment; adverse events; change of mean disease activity measured by DAS28, clinical disease activity index (CDAI) and simplified disease activity index (SDAI); the proportion of modified Sharp score increase 0.3; ultrasound-detected remission in hands; Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and health related quality of life [the five-level EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-5L) and short form-6D (SF-6D)]. Discussion: The aim of this trail will be to seek effective treatment options of preventing relapse of RA. The results of the current study may provide an instructive recommendation for more economical application of TNFi treatment in RA.

49,2019,32106881,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,"Background: Last decades witnessed great technological advances in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management, but their implementation in clinical practice might prove difficult. Despite the efficacy demonstrated in controlled trials this information needs to be confirmed by real life data. This study assessed real-life treatment among RA patients. Methods: REAL study included Brazilian RA patients from eleven centers. Interview and medical records were performed. Continuous variables were compared using Student's t or Mann-Whitney and categorical variables were assessed with chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Results: 1115 patients were included, women 89.5%. Median age 56.6 years, disease duration 152.5 months; 78.7% were rheumatoid fator positive; 55.2% had erosive disease; DAS28 (disease activity index-28 joints) = 3.5, HAQ (health assessment questionnaire) =0.875. The median duration of symptoms until the start of first DMARD was 12 months. A total of 529 (47.2%) patients used corticosteroids; 1022 (90.8%) were on conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs and 406 (36.1%) on biological (b) DMARDs. Methotrexate (MTX) was the most frequent csDMARD: 748 (66.5%) patients, followed by leflunomide (LFN), used by 381 (33.9%) of patients. MTX was associated to LFN in 142 (12.6%) patients. Only five (0.4%) patients used triple therapy (MTX + hydroxychloroquine + sulfasalazine) or sulfasalazine in monotherapy. Conclusions: Despite advances in therapeutic resources, roughly half RA patients failed achieve T2T goals and 55.2% developed erosive disease. The frequent use of corticosteroids and delay in initiating DMARDs were demonstrated. Issues concerning timely access to medical care are crucial for effective management.",0.9996324777603149
49,2019,32088801,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,"The treatment of inflammatory arthritides has been changed dramatically in the past two decades with the introduction of the biological (b) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as well as the targeting synthetic (ts) DMARDs that can be used as monotherapy or in combination with conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs. The concept of treat to target (T2T) and tight control monitoring of disease activity represents a therapeutic paradigm of modern rheumatology. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), this treatment approach has proven to be effective in many clinical trials and is now a well-established approach. The most common treatment strategies rely on the combination of csDMARDs (mainly methotrexate, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine). This comes from different studies which compare the outcomes of combination therapies versus csDMARD monotherapy or versus methotrexate plus biologics in early RA patients. Here, we review the literature of the most important T2T studies for RA patients. The results showed that a tight control strategy appears to be more important than a specific drug to control RA. T2T approach aiming for remission or low disease activity can be achieved in early RA patients using less expensive drugs in comparison to newer drugs and this may need to be recognised in the future recommendations for the management of RA. KEY POINTS: • Tight-control and treat-to-target (T2T) strategies are the cornerstone in achieving remission or low disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) • A plethora of clinical trials has confirmed the efficacy of csDMARDs when the tight-control and T2T strategies are applied • T2T and tight-control strategies are a less expensive option in comparison to newer drugs and may be recognised in the future recommendations for the management of RA. • Treatment decisions and strategies are more important than just the drugs.",0.9998503923416138
49,2019,31852268,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,"Introduction : Despite the therapeutic effectiveness of biologics targeting immune cells or cytokines in patients with inflammatory arthritis, which reflects their pathogenic roles, an increased infection risk is observed in those undergoing biological treatment. However, there are limited data regarding the comparison of infection risks in inflammatory arthritis patients treated with non-biologics (csDMARDs), biologics (bDMARDs), including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and non-TNF inhibitors, or targeted synthetic (ts)DMARDs. Areas covered : Through a review of English-language literature as of 30 June 2019, we focus on the existing evidence on the risk of infections caused by bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis , and hepatitis virus in inflammatory arthritis patients undergoing treatment with csDMARDs, bDMARDs, or tsDMARDs. Expert opinion : While the risks of bacterial and mycobacterial infection are increased in arthritis patients treated with csDMARDs, the risks are further higher in those receiving bDMARDs therapy, particularly TNF inhibitors. Regarding HBV infection, antiviral therapy may effectively prevent HBV reactivation in patients receiving bDMARDs, especially rituximab. However, more data are needed to establish effective preventive strategies for HBsAg-negative/HBcAb-positive patients. It seems safe to use cyclosporine and TNF inhibitors in patients with HCV infection, while those undergoing rituximab therapies should be frequently monitored for HCV activity.

49,2019,31556983,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory, chronic disease of the joint that is characterized by activation of autoantibodies against immunoglobulin G and anticitrullinated protein antibodies. Activated immune cells cause synovial accumulation that leads to cartilage and bone erosion. The prevalence of RA in urban Quebec between 1992 and 2008 was estimated to be as high as 995 per 100,000 females aged 45 years and older and 994 per 100,000 males in the same age group. The prevalence was estimated to be 205 per 100,000 females younger than 45 years, and 73 per 100,000 males younger than 45 years. The prevalence values were lower in age-matched rural populations except for females aged 45 years and older. In Ontario, the prevalence in 2010 was estimated to be 784 (with a 95% confidence interval of 779 to 789) per 100,000 people. Patients with RA have a shorter life expectancy than the general population and are at higher risk of experiencing cardiovascular events. Methotrexate (MTX), a conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (csDMARD), is a folic acid antagonist and is the drug that is most commonly used to treat RA. Some patients may be intolerant of or may not respond adequately to MTX monotherapy, therefore alternate forms of therapy have emerged. Other csDMARDs such as sulfasalazine (SSZ), leflunomide (LEF), and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are available and are offered as monotherapy or in combination with other csDMARDs or biologics. For patients who are intolerant of specific csDMARDs or whose RA is inadequately controlled with one or more csDMARDs, biologic therapies such as tumor necrosis inhibitors, T-cell stimulation inhibitors, CD20 inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, or JAK inhibitors, are increasingly being recommended. However, given that biologics are significantly more costly than csDMARDs, there are renewed efforts to determine whether combinations of csDMARDs may be more cost-effective. The aim of this report is to summarize the cost-effectiveness evidence on triple csDMARDs therapy (specifically, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine) relative to other pharmacologic options for the management of RA in North America.",0.9998552799224854

Methods: The Care in early RA study is a two-year investigator-initiated pragmatic multicentre randomized trial. Early RA patients, naïve to DMARDs and glucocorticoids, were stratified based on prognostic factors. High-risk patients were randomized to COBRA-Classic (n = 98): MTX, sulfasalazine, prednisone step-down from 60 mg; COBRA-Slim (n = 98): MTX, prednisone step-down from 30 mg; or COBRA-Avant-Garde (n = 93): MTX, leflunomide, prednisone step-down from 30 mg. Low-risk patients were randomized to COBRA-Slim (n = 43); or Tight Step Up (TSU) (n = 47): MTX without prednisone. Clinical/radiological outcomes at year 2, sustainability of response, safety and treatment adaptations were assessed. Results: In the high-risk group 71/98 (72%) patients achieved a DAS28-CRP 2.6 with COBRA-Slim compared with 64/98 (65%) with COBRA-Classic and 69/93 (74%) with COBRA-Avant-Garde (P = 1.00). Other clinical/radiological outcomes and sustainability of response were similar. COBRA-Slim treatment resulted in less therapy-related adverse events compared with COBRA-Classic (P = 0.02) or COBRA-Avant-Garde (P = 0.005). In the low-risk group, 29/43 (67%) patients on COBRA-Slim and 34/47 (72%) on TSU achieved a DAS28-CRP 2.6 (P = 1.00). On COBRA-Slim, low-risk patients had lower longitudinal DAS28-CRP scores over 2 years, a lower need for glucocorticoid injections and a comparable safety profile compared with TSU. Conclusion: All regimens combining DMARDs with glucocorticoids were effective for patients with early RA up to 2 years. The COBRA-Slim regimen, MTX monotherapy with glucocorticoid bridging, provided the best balance between efficacy and safety, irrespective of patients' prognosis.

Patients and methods: A retrospective cohort study analyzed consecutive patients who underwent RBS in 12 referral bariatric centers in Poland from 2010 to 2020. The study included 529 patients. The efficacy endpoints were percentage of excessive weight loss (%EWL) and remission of hypertension (HT) and/or type 2 diabetes (T2D). Results: Group 1: weight regain Two hundred thirty-eight of 352 patients (67.6%) exceeded 50% EWL after RBS. The difference in body mass index (BMI) pre-RBS and lowest after primary procedure 10.6 kg/m2 (OR 2.33, 95% CI: 1.43-3.80, p = 0.001) was independent factor contributing to bariatric success after RBS, i.e., &gt; 50% EWL.

50,2019,36235590,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,"Obesity is recognized as an independent risk factor for the development of kidney disease, which has led to the designation of obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG). Common renal features observed in this condition include glomerular hypertrophy, glomerulosclerosis, haemodynamic changes and glomerular filtration barrier defects. Additionally, and although less studied, obesity-related kidney disease also involves alterations in renal tubules, including tubule hypertrophy, lipid deposition and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Although not completely understood, the harmful effects of obesity on the kidney may be mediated by different mechanisms, with alterations in adipose tissue probably playing an important role. An increase in visceral adipose tissue has classically been associated with the development of kidney damage, however, recent studies point to adipose tissue surrounding the kidney, and specifically to the fat within the renal sinus, as potentially involved in the development of ORG. In addition, new strategies for the treatment of patients with obesity-related kidney disease are focusing on the management of obesity. In this regard, some non-invasive options, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, are being considered for application in the clinic, not only for patients with diabetic kidney disease but as a novel pharmacological strategy for patients with ORG.

Several studies have confirmed the safety and short-term efficacy of intragastric balloons (IGBs). In the short-term IGBs may improve steatosis and fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and improve quality of life and mental health. Unfortunately weight loss from these temporarily placed devices is not sustained long-term. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) may be more effective and durable than IGBs, and result in fewer adverse events compared to bariatric surgery. The recently completed MERIT trial may catapult ESG as a first-line EBMT. Aspiration therapy meets safety and effectiveness thresholds for incorporation into routine practice, but overall acceptance has been lower than other FDA-approved EBMTs. Summary: The field of endobariatrics is rapidly maturing. Significant knowledge gaps remain with regards to combining EBMTs with pharmacologic therapy to improve durability of weight loss.

Since obesity is the most prevalent risk factor for NAFLD, weight loss is an effective therapeutic solution. Bariatric surgery (BS), which can achieve long-term weight loss, improves the overall health of patients with NAFLD. The two most common surgeries are the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. The gut-liver axis is the complex network of cross-talking between the gut, its microbiome, and the liver. The gut microbiome, involved in the homeostasis of the gut-liver axis, is believed to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and the metabolic improvement after BS. Alterations in the gut microbiome in NAFLD have been confirmed compared to that in healthy individuals. The mechanisms linking the gut microbiome to NAFLD have been proposed, including increased intestinal permeability, higher energy intake, and other pathophysiological alterations. Interestingly, several correlation studies suggested that the gut microbial signatures after BS become more similar to those of lean, healthy controls than that of patients with NAFLD. The resolution of NAFLD after BS is related to changes in the gut microbiome and its metabolites. However, confirming a causal link remains challenging.

Methods: Twenty rats were fed on high-fat diet and administered with a low-dose (30mg/kg) of streptozotocin to establish T2DM models. The rats were then randomly assigned to the SADI-S group (n=10) and sham operation group (n=9). Stool samples were collected from all rats at 8 weeks after surgery and stored at -80 °C. Metabolomics analysis was performed to identify differential metabolites through ultra- performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: At 8-week after surgery, rats of the SADI-S group showed significantly decreased fasting blood glucose, glucose tolerance test 2-hour, glycated haemoglobin, and body weight compared with those of the sham group. A total of 245 differential metabolites were identified between the two groups. Among them, 16 metabolites such as branched-chain amino acids (valine), aromatic amino acid (phenylalanine), bile acid (cholic acid, lithocholic acid, and β-muricholic acid), short-chain fatty acid (isobutyric acid), and phospholipid [lysoPE(17:0), lysoPE(20:3) and lysoPS(16:0)] were associated to the T2DM remission after SADI-S. Conclusion: SADI-S improves T2DM in rats by regulating phenylalanine biosynthesis, valine, phenylalanine, alanine, glutamate, proline, bile acid, and phospholipid metabolism pathways.",0.9998719692230225
50,2019,36201380,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,"Background: Physical activity levels after bariatric surgery are usually low, despite the significant protective health benefits of physical activity in this population. Positive psychological well-being is associated with improved adherence to health behaviors, but bariatric surgery patients often have negative associations with physical activity that prevent sustained engagement. Objective: The Gaining Optimism After weight Loss Surgery (GOALS) pilot randomized controlled trial is aimed at testing a novel intervention to increase physical activity after bariatric surgery, which incorporates positive psychological skill-building with motivational interviewing and goal-setting. Methods: The GOALS trial is a 2-arm, 24-week pilot randomized controlled trial that aims to enroll 58 adults who report less than 200 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity and a desire to become more active 6-12 months after bariatric surgery. GOALS is testing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a positive psychology-motivational interviewing telephone intervention targeting to increase physical activity and associated positive affect. Intervention components include positive psychology, goal-setting, self-monitoring via provided Fitbits, and motivational interviewing to overcome barriers and increase motivation. The intervention is compared to a physical activity education control that includes mailings with psychoeducation around physical activity and provision of a Fitbit. The primary outcomes of the pilot trial are feasibility and acceptability, measured as session completion rates and participant ratings of ease and helpfulness of each session. The main secondary outcome is change in accelerometer-measured moderate to vigorous physical activity post intervention and at 24-week follow-up. Additional outcomes include changes in attitudes related to physical activity, psychological well-being, and physical health measures. Results: This multiphase project was funded in 2020 and institutional review board approval was obtained for the proposed trial in 2021. Recruitment for the randomized controlled trial began in July 2022. Upon completion of the pilot trial, we will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention. Conclusions: Although bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment available for severe obesity, weight regain occurs, often in the context of low psychological well-being. Many individuals would benefit from learning strategies to increase positive psychological well-being after bariatric surgery, which could help them maintain lifestyle changes. Positive psychology is a novel approach to improve adherence by increasing positive associations with health behaviors including physical activity. The GOALS pilot trial will determine whether this type of intervention is feasible and acceptable to this population and will provide a foundation for a future full-scale randomized controlled efficacy trial.

While Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is known to impair intestinal fractional calcium absorption (FCA) and negatively affect bone metabolism, LSG's effects on calcium homeostasis and bone health have not been well characterized. Objective: We determined the effect of LSG on FCA, while maintaining robust 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels and recommended calcium intake. Design, setting, participants: Prospective pre-post observational cohort study of 35 women and men with severe obesity undergoing LSG. Main outcomes: FCA was measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively with a gold-standard dual stable isotope method. Other measures included calciotropic hormones, bone turnover markers, and bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and quantitative computed tomography. Results: Mean ± SD FCA decreased from 31.4 ± 15.4% preoperatively to 16.1 ± 12.3% postoperatively (p 0.01), while median (IQR) 25OHD levels were 39 (32-46) ng/mL and 36 (30-46) ng/mL, respectively. Concurrently, median 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level increased from 60 (50-82) pg/mL to 86 (72-107) pg/mL (p 0.01), without significant changes in parathyroid hormone or 24-hour urinary calcium levels. Bone turnover marker levels increased substantially, and areal BMD decreased at the proximal femur. Those with lower postoperative FCA had greater areal BMD loss at the total hip (ρ=0.45, p 0.01). Conclusions: FCA decreases after LSG, with a concurrent rise in bone turnover marker levels and decline in BMD, despite robust 25OHD levels and with recommended calcium intake. Decline in FCA could contribute to negative skeletal effects following LSG.",0.9998966455459595

We aim to identify, and compare first aid practices in children who present to Emergency Departments (ED) with a burn. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study of 500 children (0-16 completed years) presenting with a burn to a paediatric ED in the UK (Cardiff) and the USA (Denver, Colorado), during 2015-2017. The proportion of children who had received some form of first aid and the quality of first aid were compared between cities. Results: Children attending hospital with a burn in Cardiff were 1.47 times more likely (RR 1.47; CI 1.36, 1.58), to have had some form of first aid than those in Denver. Denver patients were 4.7 time more likely to use a dressing and twice as likely to apply ointment/gel/aloe vera than the Cardiff cohort. First aid consistent with local recommendations was only administered to 26% (128/500) of children in Cardiff and 6% (31/500) in Denver. Potentially harmful first aid e.g. application of food, oil, toothpaste, shampoo or ice was applied to 5% of children in Cardiff and 10% in Denver. Conclusion: A low number of children received optimal burns first aid, with potentially harmful methods applied in a considerable proportion of cases.

51,2019,31791294,Can dehumidifiers be used to control asthma?,dehumidifiers asthma,0.0,"Background: Quantifying the effects of personal health behaviors and environmental exposure on asthma flare-ups is a challenge. Most studies have focused on monitoring the symptoms and drug usage for relieving symptoms. In this study, we emphasize the need to understand how personal and environmental conditions are related to the occurrence of asthma symptoms. Methods: We designed an online health diary platform to collect personal health behaviors from children, their parents and other adults with any allergic diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and allergic conjunctivitis. The participants used mobile devices or computers to record their daily health-related activities such as sleep, exercise, diet, perception of air quality and temperature, and asthma symptoms. The participants also recorded secondhand smoke exposure and the time of activities, which were combined with ambient air quality measurements for calculating personal air pollution exposure. A generalized linear mixed model was used to estimate the effects of the factors. Results: During the study period (January 2017-June 2017, and October 2017-September 2018), 132 participants provided 25,016 diary entries, and 84 participants had experienced asthma symptoms in 1458 diary entries. The results showed some different risk factors for the minors and adults. For minors, high-intensity exercise, contact with persons with influenza-like illness (ILI) and the perception of hot temperature and bad indoor air quality were associated with the occurrence of asthma episodes. The identified risk factors for the adult participants included having dehumidifiers at home, exposure to secondhand smoke, having bad sleep quality, contact with persons with ILI, not eating fruit and seafood, perceiving cold temperature, bad quality of indoor and outdoor air, and exposure to high concentration of ozone. Conclusions: The revealed personal risk factors and perceptions of air quality and temperature may provide guidance on behavioral change for people susceptible to asthma to help control acute onset and severe exacerbation of asthma flare-ups.",0.034225933253765106
51,2019,23760885,Can dehumidifiers be used to control asthma?,dehumidifiers asthma,0.0,"Background: Humidity control measures in the home environment of patients with asthma have been recommended, since a warm humid environment favours the growth of house dust mites. However, there is no consensus about the usefulness of these measures. Objectives: To study the effect of dehumidification of the home environment on asthma control. Search methods: The clinical trials registers of the Cochrane Collaboration and Cochrane Airways Group were searched. Searches were current as of March 2013. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials on the use of humidity control measures in the home environment of patients with asthma were evaluated for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted independently using a pre-designed data extraction form by two review authors. Main results: A second trial has been added for the 2013 update of this review. The original open-label trial compared an intervention consisting of mechanical ventilation heat recovery system with or without high efficiency vacuum cleaner fitted in 40 homes of patients with asthma who had positive tests for sensitivity to house dust mite. The new double-blind trial also compared a mechanical ventilation heat recovery system with a placebo machine in the homes of 120 adults with allergy to house dust mite. The new trial, which was at low risk of bias, showed no significant difference in morning peak flow (mean difference (MD) 13.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.66 to 29.84), which was the primary outcome of the trial. However, there was a statistically significant improvement in evening peak flow only (MD 24.56; 95% CI 8.97 to 40.15). There was no significant difference in quality of life, rescue medication, requirement for oral corticosteroids, visits to the GP, emergency department (ED) or hospitalisations for asthma. There was no significant difference in the house dust mite count and the antigen levels in the new trial, in contrast to the previous trial. Authors' conclusions: Evidence on clinical benefits of dehumidification using mechanical ventilation with dehumidifiers remains scanty, and the addition of a new double blind trial to this review does not indicate significant benefit in most measure of control of asthma from such environmental interventions.",0.9993525147438049
51,2019,21121233,Can dehumidifiers be used to control asthma?,dehumidifiers asthma,0.0,"Objectives: The National Asthma Survey--New York State (NYS), a telephone survey of NYS residents, was conducted in 2002-2003 to further understand the burden of asthma among adults and children and to identify health, socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental factors associated with asthma. Methods: A total of 1,412 households with at least one member with current asthma and 2,290 control households answered questions about their home environment (e.g., presence of asthma triggers and practices that promote or reduce common asthma triggers). RESULTS; For children younger than 18 years of age, we found statistically significant positive associations between current asthma and the presence of mold (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3, 3.3), air cleaners (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1, 2.1), dehumidifiers (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.4, 2.7), and humidifiers (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1, 2.3). For adults, there were statistically significant positive associations with the presence of mold (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.8, 3.4), air cleaners (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.7, 2.8), and humidifiers (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.1, 1.8). There were no statistically significant associations with the presence of cockroaches, pets, or tobacco smoke, while use of a wood-burning stove or fireplace was significantly more prevalent in control homes. Conclusions: Asthma guidelines emphasize the importance of reducing triggers in the home as part of a multifaceted approach to asthma control. Despite these guidelines, many asthma triggers (specifically, mold) were as prevalent or more so in the homes of New Yorkers with asthma as compared with control households. Public health interventions in NYS should focus on educating households about potential asthma triggers and their sources and teach methods to prevent, reduce, or eliminate them.",0.9997978806495667
51,2019,10931126,Can dehumidifiers be used to control asthma?,dehumidifiers asthma,0.0,"Background: House dust mites (HDM) are sensitive to humidity. Few studies have adequately examined the potential of dehumidification in reducing HDM numbers. Objective: The study examined the effect of portable domestic dehumidifiers, and a behavioural programme to reduce humidity, on HDM counts and HDM allergen levels. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was undertaken. A total of 76 homes were allocated to three groups that received a portable domestic dehumidifier, a behavioural programme, or no intervention. Humidity, temperature, HDM counts (trap and vacuum samples), HDM allergen, and other details of the home environment were measured on four occasions over a period of 1 year. Interventions and measurements were concerned predominantly with one bedroom. Results: There was a reduction in relative humidity in the dehumidifier group, but not the behavioural group. A decline in HDM trap counts was observed for all three groups. Change scores did not indicate that the dehumidifier group had a greater decline than the other groups. A secondary analysis examining presence or absence of HDM showed a shift from households having HDM at baseline to households not having HDM in the final round for some trap measures. Change score analysis indicated that this shift was greater in the dehumidifier group compared with other groups. The dehumidifier group did not show a greater decline in HDM allergen than that seen in the other two groups. Conclusion: Neither the dehumidifier nor the behavioural intervention had a major effect on HDM counts or allergen levels. However, the study did have a number of limitations relating to size, timing of intervention, and running of the dehumidifiers. The secondary data analysis may indicate some effect of dehumidification, but clearly this effect was small. There is a need for more information on the effects of reducing ambient humidity on the distribution of HDM within their habitats.",0.00030240631895139813

The aims of this study were to analyze DH tolerance in asthmatic patients, to assess the parasitological effects and to analyze the environmental effects produced by the use of these appliances in the bedrooms of asthmatic patients sensitized to house dust mites. 10 stable asthmatic patients sensitized to house dust mites were studied. DH appliances (CD-300) were installed in their bedrooms. Each patient was given symptom scoring tables and a portable peak expiratory flow (P.E.F.) during a period of 5 months, 1 month before installing the DH and 4 months afterwards. To study the parasitological efficacy of the DHs, we analyzed dust samples from the bedrooms and determined the Der p I, Der f I and Der II allergens by means of a modified ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies. Dust samples were collected before installing the DHs and after they had been working for 2 and 4 months. Dry temperature and relative humidity measurements at three time intervals (7-9, 15-17 and 22-24 h) were carried out. The 1st measurement was done prior to installation of the DHs in the patients' bedrooms and the 2nd and 3rd were achieved 2 and 4 months respectively after the installation. Statistical analysis was done by comparison of paired means. No significant differences were detected in the patients' symptoms nor in the P.E.F. measurements in the course of the study.

There is no cure for asthma, and the management is usually as per published guidelines. As in many chronic diseases conditions, various alternative or complimentary therapies have been tried. Of these, yoga and pranayama have gained wider attention in recent years. While the term yoga is a complex term encompassing eight limbs as per Patamjai in the yoga sutras, in simple terms, yoga is described as a combination of 'asana' (physical exercises) and 'pranayama' (breathing exercise). The term ""asthma"" has been derived from the Greek word ""panting,"", which indicates a rapid and shallow breathing. The main aim of yoga and pranayama in asthma is to synchronize and control breathing, thus decreasing hyperventilation. Besides this, they also decrease the stress/strain/anxiety, change in behavior, boost immunity, and improve strength/endurance of respiratory muscles that are helpful in any subject with asthma. There have been a good number of studies including clinical trials in children with asthma that have found some beneficial effects. In the present review, the physiology of yoga and pranayama, rationale for their use in children with asthma along with a summary of various studies conducted till date, have been discussed.

Asthma management plans focus on optimisation of asthma pharmacotherapy. Lifestyle interventions also hold great promise for asthma sufferers as they are accessible, low cost and have minimal side-effects, thus making adherence more likely. This review explores lifestyle interventions that have been tested in asthma, including improving nutrition, increasing physical activity and introduction of relaxation therapies such as yoga and massage therapy. Available evidence suggests a protective effect of increasing fruit, vegetable and wholegrain intake and increasing physical activity levels in asthma. Weight loss is recommended for obese asthmatic patients, as just 5-10% weight loss has been found to improve quality of life and asthma control in most obese asthmatic patients. Other lifestyle interventions such as meditation, yoga and massage therapy show promise, with positive effects on asthma seen in some studies. However, the study protocols are highly variable and the results are inconsistent. Additional research is needed to further develop and refine recommendations regarding lifestyle modifications that can be implemented to improve asthma. Key points: Improving diet quality, by increasing fruit, vegetable and wholegrain intake and reducing saturated fat intake, should be recommended in asthma, as there is evidence suggesting that this leads to improvements in airway inflammation, asthma control and exacerbation risk.Regular physical activity should be promoted for people with asthma, as it can improve quality of life and lung function, as well as general health.In obese asthmatic patients, weight loss should be recommended, as it leads to numerous health benefits, including improvements in asthma. Even small amounts of weight loss in adults (5-10% body weight) have been shown to improve asthma quality of life and asthma control in the majority of people with asthma.There is some evidence of benefit of meditation, yoga and breathing exercises for adults with asthma, while massage therapy shows promise in children with asthma.

107,2021,31079340,Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,yoga asthma,1.0,"Several factors have been associated with the development of asthma and asthma-related morbidity and mortality. Exposures in the environment such as allergens and air pollutants have traditionally been linked to the risk of asthma and asthma outcomes. More recent literature has identified chronic psychosocial stress as an additional environmental exposure to consider in relation to asthma. Adverse childhood events (ACEs) and chronic and toxic stress have been associated with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chronic stress has also been shown to result in biological changes such as expression of immunologic genes, changes in expression of the beta-adrenergic (B2AR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR-α) genes, cytokine regulation, and alterations in the hypothalamic pituitary axis and cortisol levels which all may affect asthma pathophysiology and therapeutic response among patients exposed to chronic stress. Recent research has revealed associations between ACEs and chronic and toxic stress and asthma risk in pre-conception to early childhood as well as morbidity and response to asthma treatments among pediatric and adult age groups. As some populations are more significantly impacted by asthma such as racial and ethnic minority groups, the influence of psychosocial stress has also been explored as a potential factor responsible for observed disparities in asthma prevalence and outcomes among these groups which also experience higher rates of psychosocial stress. Racial discrimination has specifically been shown to affect asthma-related outcomes among minority groups. Interventions to address the impact of chronic and toxic stress such as yoga and meditation have been shown to improve asthma outcome measures. Chronic and toxic stress is an important environmental exposure to further consider as we continue to explore the differences in underlying asthma pathophysiology leading to various disease phenotypes among patients and clinical/therapeutic response to interventions and treatments.",0.9998478889465332

These techniques primarily modify the pattern of breathing to reduce hyperventilation resulting in normalisation of CO2 level, reduction of bronchospasm and resulting breathlessness. In addition they also change the behaviour, decrease anxiety, improve immunological parameters, and improve endurance of the respiratory muscles that may ultimately help asthmatic children. We found 10 clinical trials conducted in children with asthma of varying severity, and found to benefit children with chronic (mild and moderate) and uncontrolled asthma, but not acute severe asthma. Breathing exercises or yoga and/or pranayama may benefit children with chronic (mild and moderate) and uncontrolled asthma, but not acute severe asthma.

107,2021,11828038,Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,yoga asthma,1.0,"Background: Sahaja Yoga is a traditional system of meditation based on yogic principles which may be used for therapeutic purposes. A study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of this therapy as an adjunctive tool in the management of asthma in adult patients who remained symptomatic on moderate to high doses of inhaled steroids. Methods: A parallel group, double blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted. Subjects were randomly allocated to Sahaja yoga and control intervention groups. Both the yoga and the control interventions required the subjects to attend a 2 hour session once a week for 4 months. Asthma related quality of life (AQLQ, range 0-4), Profile of Mood States (POMS), level of airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (AHR), and a diary card based combined asthma score (CAS, range 0-12) reflecting symptoms, bronchodilator usage, and peak expiratory flow rates were measured at the end of the treatment period and again 2 months later. Results: Twenty one of 30 subjects randomised to the yoga intervention and 26 of 29 subjects randomised to the control group were available for assessment at the end of treatment. The improvement in AHR at the end of treatment was 1.5 doubling doses (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0 to 2.9, p=0.047) greater in the yoga intervention group than in the control group. Differences in AQLQ score (0.41, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.86) and CAS (0.9, 95% CI -0.9 to 2.7) were not significant (p&gt;0.05). The AQLQ mood subscale did improve more in the yoga group than in the control group (difference 0.63, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.20), as did the summary POMS score (difference 18.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 36.5, p=0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups at the 2 month follow up assessment. Conclusions: This randomised controlled trial has shown that the practice of Sahaja yoga does have limited beneficial effects on some objective and subjective measures of the impact of asthma. Further work is required to understand the mechanism underlying the observed effects and to establish whether elements of this intervention may be clinically valuable in patients with severe asthma.",0.9988610744476318

109,2021,34787691,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Purpose: This review aimed to provide an overview of current research into the risk factors for Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO). Methods: To find information about the risk factors for GO, the research database PubMed was searched and relevant articles were obtained to extract information about risk factors. Results: Smoking has been widely accepted as an important risk factor and cigarette smoking cessation has been shown to improve the outcome and decrease the onset of GO. Radioactive iodine on the thyroid may induce hyperthyroidism and increase the occurrence of GO. Selenium deficiency is a risk factor for GO and the supplementation of selenium has been an adjuvant therapy. Decreasing stressful life events (SLE) may help improve GO. Imbalance in intestinal flora is essential to GO, with Yersinia enterocolitica and Escherichia coli both increased in the digestive tract of the individual with GO. In addition, controlling serum cholesterol may help improve GO since adipogenesis is an important pathological change in its pathogenesis. Considering the correlation between Graves' disease and GO, maintaining normal thyroid function hormone level is the first-line therapeutic strategy to prevent progression of GO. An increase in antibodies such as TSHR and IGF-1R is the main predictor of GO. Besides, gender and gene polymorphism are also risk factors towards GO. Conclusions: Risk factors for GO arise from five sources: physical and chemical environment, social-psychological environment, biological environment, the human organism, and genetic codes. Risk factors within these categories may interact with each other and their mechanisms in promoting the development of GO are complex. Research into risk factors for GO may promote emerging fields related to GO such as control of autoantibodies and intestinal microbiota.",0.024516234174370766

Selenium supplementation may increase risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: The Selenium and Celecoxib (Sel/Cel) Trial was a randomized, placebo controlled trial of selenium 200 µg daily as selenized yeast and celecoxib 400 mg once daily, alone or together, for colorectal adenoma prevention. Men and women between age 40 and 80 years were eligible following colonoscopic removal of colorectal adenomas. The primary outcome was adenoma development. Celecoxib was suspended because of cardiovascular toxicity in other trials, but accrual continued to selenium and placebo. A total of 1621 participants were randomly assigned to selenium or placebo, of whom 1374 (84.8%) were available for analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: In the respective placebo and selenium arms of 689 and 685 participants, adenoma detection after medians of 33.6 (range = 0.0-85.1 months) and 33.0 months (range = 0.0-82.6 months) were 42.8% and 44.1% (relative risk [RR] = 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91 to 1.16, P = .68). In participants with baseline advanced adenomas, adenoma recurrence was reduced by 18% with selenium (RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.71 to 0.96, P = .01). In participants receiving selenium, the hazard ratio for new-onset T2D was 1.25 (95% CI = 0.74 to 2.11, P = .41), with a statistically significantly increased risk of selenium-associated T2D among older participants (RR = 2.21; 95% CI = 1.04 to 4.67, P = .03). Conclusions: Overall, selenium did not prevent colorectal adenomas and showed only modest benefit in patients with baseline advanced adenomas.

109,2021,25607556,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Previous studies in mice have shown that topical L-selenomethionine (SeMet) can prevent UVB-induced skin cancer when applied continuously before, during, and after the radiation exposure. With topical application of SeMet, selenium levels were shown to increase in the skin and liver, as well as in tumor tissue. Thus, possibly, the timing of SeMet application could affect the degree of inhibition of UVB-tumorigenesis (or maybe even enhance tumorigenesis at some stage). The goal of this research was to determine whether topical SeMet best inhibits UV-induced skin cancer if (a) begun before and continued during and after UVB exposure, (b) if begun before UVB-exposure and discontinued when tumors are first clinically detected, or (c) if begun only after tumors are first detected and continued thereafter. Groups of ten Skh: 1 hairless, non-pigmented mice were treated topically with vehicle lotion, or with SeMet (0.05%) in that vehicle lotion applied either (a) before, during, and after UV exposure, (b) before UV radiation and continued only until the first tumor was detected, or (c) only after the first tumor was detected. In all cases, UV irradiation was discontinued at the time of detection of the first tumor. Optimal inhibition of skin cancer was achieved by application of topical SeMet before, during, and after exposure; significant protection was also attained with application only after the onset of tumors. Notably, statistically significant protection was not seen with SeMet application only prior to tumor detection. These results suggest that even beginning SeMet supplementation late in the process of tumorigenesis can help protect from UV-induced photodamage and skin cancer.",0.9998605251312256
109,2021,23077524,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Discordant results in preclinical and clinical trials have raised questions over the effectiveness of antioxidants in prostate cancer chemoprevention. Results from the large-scale Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) showed that antioxidants failed to prevent, and in some cases promoted, prostate cancer formation in men without a history of the disease. One possible explanation for these alarming results is the notion that the effects of antioxidant treatment on the prostate are modified by specific, intrinsic genetic risk factors, causing some men to respond negatively to antioxidant treatment. Loss of expression of the homeobox transcription factor NKX3.1 in the prostate is frequently associated with human prostate cancer. Nkx3.1 mutant mice display prostatic hyperplasia and dysplasia and are used as a model of the early stages of prostate cancer initiation. While the mechanisms by which Nkx3.1 loss promotes prostate tumorigenicity are not completely understood, published data have suggested that elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with Nkx3.1 loss may be a causative factor. Here we have tested this hypothesis by treating Nkx3.1 mutant mice with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for 13 weeks post-weaning. Surprisingly, while NAC treatment decreased ROS levels in Nkx3.1 mutant mouse prostates, it failed to reduce prostatic epithelial hyperplasia/dysplasia. Rather, NAC treatment increased epithelial cell proliferation and promoted the expression of a pro-proliferative gene signature. These results show that ROS do not promote proliferation in the Nkx3.1-null prostate, but instead inhibit proliferation, suggesting that antioxidant treatment may encourage prostate epithelial cell proliferation early in prostate tumorigenesis. Our findings provide new insight that may help explain the increased prostate cancer risk observed with vitamin E treatment in the SELECT trial and emphasize the need for preclinical studies using accurate models of cancer.",0.00037666785647161305

This history comprises a fascinating array of chemopreventive, vaccine, surgical, and behavioral science research, both preclinical and clinical. Preclinical milestones of cancer prevention include the 1913 and 1916 mouse studies by Lathrop and Loeb of cancer development associated with pregnancy or cancer prevention through castration (oophorectomy), preventing chemically induced mouse carcinogenesis as early as 1929, energy restriction studies in the 1940s, the 1950s discoveries and later molecular characterizations of field cancerization and multistep carcinogenesis, and the effects of angiogenesis inhibition in genetically engineered mice reported in 2009. The extraordinary panoply of clinical research includes numerous large and smaller chemoprevention studies of nutritional supplements, other dietary approaches, a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin trial in 1976, molecular-targeted agents, and agents to prevent infection-related cancers such as hepatitis B virus vaccine to prevent liver cancer in 1984. Clinical surgical prevention includes removal of intraepithelial neoplasia detected by screening (including Pap testing developed in 1929 and culposcopy for cervical premalignancy and colonoscopy and polypectomy to prevent colorectal cancer begun in the 1960s) and prophylactic surgeries, such as in Lynch syndrome patients begun in 1977. Behavioral studies include smoking cessation and control beginning in the 1950s, obesity control rooted in studies of 1841, and genetic-counseling and cancer-survivorship studies.

Methods: We carried out a prospective study of the associations between serum concentrations of antioxidant nutrients and incidence (person-based and tumor-based) of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin among a random subsample of 485 adults from an Australian community. Participants were divided into thirds, ranked according to their serum concentrations of carotenoids, alpha-tocopherol, and selenium measured in 1996 and were monitored for incident, histologically confirmed BCC and SCC tumors until 2004. Results: Although there were no associations between baseline serum carotenoids or alpha-tocopherol concentrations and incidence of BCC or SCC, baseline serum selenium concentrations showed strong inverse associations with both BCC and SCC tumor incidence. Compared with participants with lowest selenium concentrations at baseline (0.4-1.0 micromol/L), those with the highest serum selenium concentrations (1.3-2.8 micromol/L) had a decreased incidence of BCC tumors (multivariate relative risk, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.86; P(trend) = 0.02) and SCC tumors (multivariate relative risk, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.82; P(trend) = 0.02). Conclusion: Relatively high serum selenium concentrations are associated with an approximately 60% decrease in subsequent tumor incidence of both BCC and SCC, whereas serum concentrations of carotenoids or alpha-tocopherol are not associated with later skin cancer incidence.

109,2021,16483725,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Cancer has surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death in the United States. The mortality rate for cancer is high (roughly 42%), and it increases dramatically with increasing age, especially in patients between the ages of 40 and 60 years old. Currently, the efforts at cancer prevention have been minimal. The drugs developed so far are expensive and have serious side effects. There are at least 18 vitamin D-sensitive cancers. Ultraviolet light, and specifically ultraviolet B (UVB), could reduce cancer by the limited exposure of suitable skin areas to UVB of an intensity and duration insufficient to produce skin cancer. An irrational fear of skin cancer is preventing this idea from being implemented. Though skin cancer incidence is significant, mortality from skin cancer is relatively rare. Roughly 1,000,000 Americans will be affected by skin cancer but only 10,000 deaths are expected in 2005 (a 1% mortality rate). Skin cancer is easily detected and often cured by excisional biopsy alone. Current practice among practicing clinicians is to use a prescription drug substitute for UV light, calcitriol (1-25 dihydroxycholcalciferol). However, high levels of (calcitriol) are dangerous, and there is no consensus on just what a high dose or a safe dose is. Apart from skin cancer, UV light exposure possesses few risks. Additionally, a number of botanical agents such as ginkgo biloba, vitamins E and C, carotenoids, selenium and proanthocyanidins can prevent the risk of skin cancer. Ginkgo biloba also possess the following additional cancer chemopreventive qualities: (1) promoting apoptosis of cancer cells; (2) an anti-clastogenic effect on chromosomes by repairing and reconstituting broken and damaged chromosomes; (3) a powerful therapeutic effect on the treatment of fibrosis-related cancer; (4) a therapeutic effect on free radical-induced cancer; (5) a therapeutic effect on the treatment of cancer incident to the result of numerous carcinogens; (6) a therapeutic effect on preventing free radical-induced cancer; (7) an enhancing effect on radiation therapy in the treatment of cancer; and (8) a therapeutic effect on reducing the size of cancer tumors. Ginkgo biloba is widely-used and has few adverse effects. The proposed preventive treatment for cancer consists of short intermittent exposure of the least sensitive areas of the body to sunlight and/or artificial ultraviolet light. The routine testing of plasma vitamin D levels help monitor the effectiveness of the treatment and periodic checkups with a dermatologist help monitor the safety.",0.9998041987419128

Plants accumulate varying amounts of Se in different chemical forms; some plants accumulate Se in direct relationship to the amount available from the soil, whereas others (Se-accumulators) may accumulate Se in concentrations many orders of magnitude above that in the soil. There are many different chemical forms of Se in plants, and the form partially dictates the metabolism of Se by the animal that consumes the plant.

This pilot study's purpose was to document 6-month experience changes in a woman with PCOS taking cyclic progesterone therapy because she was intolerant of combined hormonal contraceptive therapy, the current PCOS standard of care. A 31-year-old normal-weight woman with PCOS had heavy flow, irregular cycles, and was combined hormonal contraceptives-intolerant. She was prescribed cyclic oral micronized progesterone (OMP) (300 mg/ h.s. cycle days 14-27). She kept Menstrual Cycle Diary© (Diary) records, starting with the 1st treatment cycle for six cycles; she was on no other therapy. Statistical analysis a priori hypothesized progesterone decreases high estradiol (E2) experiences (flow, cervical mucus, fluid retention, front-of-the-breast tenderness and anxiety); analysis focused on these. Our objectives: (1) changes from cycles 1 to 6 in E2-related experiences; and (2) follicular phase E2-related changes from cycle 1 (no therapy) to cycles 3 and 6. Materials and Methods: Data from consecutive Diaries were entered into an SPSS database and analyzed by Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (Objective #1) within-person whole cycle ordinal data, and (Objective #2 follicular phase) repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Cyclic OMP was associated with regular, shorter cycles (±SD) (28.2 ± 0.8 days). Comparison of cycles 1-6 showed decreased fluid retention ( p = 0.001), breast tenderness ( p = 0.002), and cervical mucus ( p = 0.048); there were no changes in flow or anxiety. Fluid retention in the follicular phase also significantly decreased over time (F (1.2, 14.7) = 6.7, p = 0.017).

Its definitions, given by the AWGS and EWGSOP, are widely used. Sarcopenia is measured by muscle strength, muscle quantity or mass and physical performance. Currently, the importance and urgency of sarcopenia have grown. The application of blood flow restriction (BFR) training has received increased attention in managing sarcopenia. BFR is accomplished using a pneumatic cuff on the proximal aspect of the exercising limb. Two main methods of exercise, aerobic exercise and resistance exercise, have been applied with BFR in treating sarcopenia. Both methods can increase muscle mass and muscle strength to a certain extent. Intricate mechanisms are involved during BFRT. Currently, the presented mechanisms mainly include responses in the blood vessels and related hormones, such as growth factors, tissue hypoxia-related factors and recruitment of muscle fiber as well as muscle satellite cells. These mechanisms contribute to the positive balance of skeletal muscle synthesis, which in turn mitigates sarcopenia. As a more suited and more effective way of treating sarcopenia and its comorbidities, BFRT can serve as an alternative to traditional exercise for people who have marked physical limitations or even show superior outcomes under low loads. However, the possibility of causing stress or muscle damage must be considered. Cuff size, pressure, training load and other variables can affect the outcome of sarcopenia, which must also be considered. Thoroughly studying these factors can help to better determine an ideal BFRT scheme and better manage sarcopenia and its associated comorbidities. As a well-tolerated and novel form of exercise, BFRT offers more potential in treating sarcopenia and involves deeper insights into the function and regulation of skeletal muscle.",0.996164083480835

Exercise and a balanced diet are used as effective countermeasures for combating sarcopenia and T2DM in older adults based on their bidirectional relationship. Lifestyle changes such as exercise and a balanced diet seem to play an important role in the remission of the diseases. Results showed that chronic exercise can help towards glycemic regulation as well as decrease the incidence rate of muscle degradation, while diet interventions which focus on protein or amino acids seem to successfully treat both disorders.

In this systematic review, we aimed to examine i) the feasibility and acceptability of social media interventions targeting physical activity and/or diet for people with NCDs, ii) the effectiveness of improving exercise and diet behaviours, iii) specific design components used to promote user engagement and iv) the effectiveness on other health outcomes. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Google Scholar, CINAHL, EMBASE, and SPORTDiscus from inception until June 2021. Social media interventions targeting physical activity and/or diet were included. Participants were any age, with a diagnosis of one of the following categories of NCDs; cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes or mental illness. Interventions using social media alone or as part of an intervention with other modes of delivery were included. Eligible study designs were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials, feasibility or pilot studies, or quasi-experimental studies. Results: A total of 2358 publications were identified. After removal of duplicates, 2233 publication titles and abstracts were screened, and 10 publications were eligible, describing 8 individual studies. The study designs included five RCTs and three pilot or feasibility studies, all published between 2016 and 2020. Sample sizes ranged from n = 11 to n = 312. Half of the studies were conducted in the United States of America. Clinical populations included severe mental illness (2 studies), cardiovascular disease (2 studies), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2 studies), cancer (1 study) and Type 2 diabetes (1 study). Facebook (three studies) and WeChat (three studies) were the most used social media platforms. The majority utilised social media to deliver health education and facilitate social support and all studies reported &gt;70% retention. Four of the five included RCTS reported significant improvements in exercise behaviours (e.g., step count, exercise capacity) while diet was only assessed in two studies and results were non-significant. Conclusions: Social media interventions appear to be feasible and acceptable among specific NCD populations and preliminary evidence suggests interventions they may be effective for improving exercise behaviours. The evidence for diet behaviours remains unclear. While overall there is an emerging evidence base, more rigorous evaluation including replication studies are needed to determine the efficacy of social media interventions.",0.9995322227478027

116,2021,35061856,Does exercise help manage diabetes?,exercise diabetes,1.0,"Background: Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They are therefore recommended to follow a healthy diet and be physically active in order to reduce that risk. However, achieving and maintaining these behaviours in the postpartum period is challenging. This study sought to explore women's views on suggested practical approaches to achieve and maintain a healthy diet and physical activity to reduce T2DM risk. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 20 participants in Cambridgeshire, UK were conducted at three to 48 months after GDM. The participants' current diet and physical activity, intentions for any changes, and views on potential interventions to help manage T2DM risk through these behaviours were discussed. Framework analysis was used to analyse the transcripts. The interview schedule, suggested interventions, and thematic framework were based on a recent systematic review. Results: Most of the participants wanted to eat more healthily and be more active. A third of the participants considered that postpartum support for these behaviours would be transformative, a third thought it would be beneficial, and a third did not want additional support. The majority agreed that more information about the impact of diet and physical activity on diabetes risk, support to exercise with others, and advice about eating healthily, exercising with a busy schedule, monitoring progress and sustaining changes would facilitate a healthy diet and physical activity. Four other suggested interventions received mixed responses. It would be acceptable for this support to be delivered throughout pregnancy and postpartum through a range of formats. Clinicians were seen to have important roles in giving or signposting to support. Conclusions: Many women would appreciate more support to reduce their T2DM risk after GDM and believe that a variety of interventions to integrate changes into their daily lives would help them to sustain healthier lifestyles.",0.9991624355316162
116,2021,34994695,Does exercise help manage diabetes?,exercise diabetes,1.0,"Background: Information and communication technology (ICT) offers considerable potential for supporting older adults in managing their health, including chronic diseases. However, there are mixed opinions about the benefits and effectiveness of ICT interventions for older adults with chronic diseases. Objective: We aim to map the use of ICT interventions in health care and identified barriers to and enablers of its use among older adults with chronic disease. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using 5 databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO, and ProQuest) to identify eligible articles from January 2000 to July 2020. Publications incorporating the use of ICT interventions, otherwise known as eHealth, such as mobile health, telehealth and telemedicine, decision support systems, electronic health records, and remote monitoring in people aged ≥55 years with chronic diseases were included. We conducted a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats framework analysis to explore the implied enablers of and barriers to the use of ICT interventions. Results: Of the 1149 identified articles, 31 (2.7%; n=4185 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Of the 31 articles, 5 (16%) mentioned the use of various eHealth interventions. A range of technologies was reported, including mobile health (8/31, 26%), telehealth (7/31, 23%), electronic health record (2/31, 6%), and mixed ICT interventions (14/31, 45%). Various chronic diseases affecting older adults were identified, including congestive heart failure (9/31, 29%), diabetes (7/31, 23%), chronic respiratory disease (6/31, 19%), and mental health disorders (8/31, 26%). ICT interventions were all designed to help people self-manage chronic diseases and demonstrated positive effects. However, patient-related and health care provider-related challenges, in integrating ICT interventions in routine practice, were identified. Barriers to using ICT interventions in older adults included knowledge gaps, a lack of willingness to adopt new skills, and reluctance to use technologies. Implementation challenges related to ICT interventions such as slow internet connectivity and lack of an appropriate reimbursement policy were reported. Advantages of using ICT interventions include their nonpharmacological nature, provision of health education, encouragement for continued physical activity, and maintenance of a healthy diet. Participants reported that the use of ICT was a fun and effective way of increasing their motivation and supporting self-management tasks. It gave them reassurance and peace of mind by promoting a sense of security and reducing anxiety. Conclusions: ICT interventions have the potential to support the care of older adults with chronic diseases. However, they have not been effectively integrated with routine health care. There is a need to improve awareness and education about ICT interventions among those who could benefit from them, including older adults, caregivers, and health care providers. More sustainable funding is required to promote the adoption of ICT interventions. We recommend involving clinicians and caregivers at the time of designing ICT interventions.",0.999824583530426
116,2021,34924318,Does exercise help manage diabetes?,exercise diabetes,1.0,"Aims: The purpose of this study was to estimate, for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), the extent to which glycemic control was affected by a 12-week program using mobile app and wearable smartwatch in comparison to supervised exercise training. Methods: This study was a stratified, randomized, assessor-blind, controlled, pragmatic trial with three parallel groups which were supervised, mobile app and wearable smartwatch. Individually tailored exercise regimens delivered through a supervisor, mobile app and wearable smartwatch. Programs consisted of aerobic, resistance exercises, calisthenic, flexibility, balance, and coordination exercises. Primary outcome was change in glycemic control (HbA1c); secondary outcome was Six Minute Walk Test; and explanatory outcomes were exercise behaviour, muscle function, and physical capacity. The groups were contrasted for change in HbA1c and absolute reduction of ≥0.5% (Minimal Important Change). Linear and logistic regressions were used to compare the groups and generalized estimated equations were used to analyze the explanatory outcomes. Results: In total, 90 people were randomized, 6 were lost over 12 weeks, leaving 84 with outcome data. The difference in HbA1c did not differ between the supervised and the technology groups combined and between the mobile app and smartwatch group. Proportions of people achieving a clinically meaningful difference on HbA1c between the supervised and technology groups were similar (46% vs 43%) and the associated OR was 0.87 (95%CI:0.34-2.28). Within the two technology groups, proportions of people achieving a clinically meaningful difference in HbA1c were 48% in the mobile app and 38% in the smartwatch groups and the associated OR was 0.65 (95%CI:0.21-2.03). The groups did not differ on secondary and explanatory outcomes. Conclusions: The results of our trial provide evidence that all outcomes have improved in all groups regardless of the exercise delivery method. Considering the supervised programs are not available for everybody, technological options are crucial to implement to help individuals self-manage most aspects of their diabetes.",0.9995394945144653
118,2021,36225247,Can dupixent treat eczema?,dupixent eczema,1.0,"Background Asthma, Allergic rhinitis (AR), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Eczema, and Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Sinonasal Polyposis (CRSwNP) are illnesses often characterized by type 2 (T2) inflammation, wherein T helper (Th) cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL (interleukin)-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13. This response may also promote the production of IgE and an increase in/activation of serum eosinophils. In the aforementioned type 2 inflammatory diseases, this immune response can cause excess mucous production, inflammation of the airways, other atopic responses when patients are exposed to certain environmental allergic triggers. Relatively new biologic monoclonal antibody therapies such as dupilumab (blocks IL-4 and IL-13), benralizumab (blocks IL-5), mepolizumab (blocks IL-5), and omalizumab (blocks IgE Fc/fragment of crystallization region) offer novel therapeutic targets that more specifically and directly block type 2 inflammatory responses. Methods To examine the effect of monoclonal antibody biologic therapies on patient indicators of type 2 inflammation, a retrospective analysis of 193 patients on biologic therapy was conducted, and these patients were compared to 48 control patients with type 2 inflammatory diseases who did not initiate biologic therapy. Total Lund-MacKay radiographic score, FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in the first second), FEF25-75 (forced expiratory flow from 25-75% of the forced vital capacity curve), annualized pulmonary exacerbations, oral corticosteroid dose, and serum eosinophils were recorded at baseline (zero months), and at three, six, nine, and twelve months after initiation of biologic therapy. Least squares mean data and the percent change from the baseline of least squares mean for the biologic and control groups were compared. Results Omalizumab was the most common biologic therapy prescribed. Control patients were younger than patients who initiated biologic therapy. Patients on biologic therapy had statistically significant reductions in Lund-MacKay score, improvements in FEV1 and FEF25-75, reductions in serum IgE levels, and reductions in serum Eosinophils. Patients on biologic therapy also had statistically significant reductions in annualized pulmonary exacerbations and oral corticosteroid dose compared to controls. Conclusions Patients with a variety of type 2 inflammatory conditions appear to have significant improvements in lung function, radiographic sinusitis, and serum markers of type 2 inflammation after initiation of biologic therapy versus controls. These therapeutic medications appear to significantly improve type 2 inflammatory disease course in patients who can tolerate these medications.",0.9998682737350464
118,2021,36219538,Can dupixent treat eczema?,dupixent eczema,1.0,"Type 2 immune response is a complicated series of immune response characterized by Th2 polarization and Th2 cytokines secretion. The IgE secretion, airway hypersensitivity, and effector cell recruitment (eosinophils, mast cells, basophils) in skin lesion and peripheral blood stream could be upregulated during the activation of type 2 immune response. Th1/Th2 ratio, also referred as Th1/Th2 balance, represent the T lymphocytes immune pattern to a certain degree: Th1-dominated responses are often involved in intracellular infections (e.g. mycobacterium tuberculosis) and autoimmune diseases (e.g. Graves' disease) while Th2-dominated responses are involved in allergic conditions (e.g. atopic dermatitis, eczema), IgE mediated diseases (e.g. urticaria), and fibrotic dermatoses (e.g. keloids). Dupilumab, as one of the most widely applied Th2 cytokine inhibitors, could block the bioactivity of IL-14/IL-13 via competitively binding with the common IL-4Rα subunit shared by IL-4 and IL-13 receptors. In addition to the direct inhibition of type 2 response, dupilumab is also effective on autoimmune and some infectious skin diseases through indirect regulation of type 1 immune response. The pathological mechanism of Th2 responses and advanced clinical application of dupilumab in skin diseases will be summarized and discussed in the review. This article is protected by copyright.

118,2021,36125529,Can dupixent treat eczema?,dupixent eczema,1.0,"Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis) are promising medications that the Food and Drug Administration recently approved for treatment of atopic dermatitis in January 2022. These medications offer a novel therapeutic mechanism and may be an additional treatment avenue for patients who are currently reliant on conventional immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine A, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil, or newer medications, such as dupilumab. However, redundant treatment puts patients at risk for excessive toxicity and polypharmacy, whereas abrupt tapering of a preexisting regimen may cause flares of the disease. Thus, transitioning to JAKis should be implemented strategically to retain the therapeutic benefit and minimize the risk of flares. Herein, we outline gradual transition schemas for patients needing to transition to JAKis from conventional immunosuppressants or dupilumab. There is no evidence-based guideline to instruct this transition to JAKis, and our recommendations are based on expert experience and the review of efficacy data from pivotal trials.",0.9997497200965881
118,2021,36116481,Can dupixent treat eczema?,dupixent eczema,1.0,"Background: Current systemic treatments for children younger than 6 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that is uncontrolled with topical therapies might have suboptimal efficacy and safety. Dupilumab is approved for older children and adults with atopic dermatitis and for other type 2 inflammatory conditions. We aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of dupilumab with concomitant low-potency topical corticosteroids in children aged 6 months to younger than 6 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Methods: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3 trial was conducted in 31 hospitals, clinics, and academic institutions in Europe and North America. Eligible patients were aged 6 months to younger than 6 years, with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score 3-4) diagnosed according to consensus criteria of the American Academy of Dermatology, and an inadequate response to topical corticosteroids. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to subcutaneous placebo or dupilumab (bodyweight ≥5 kg to 15 kg: 200 mg; bodyweight ≥15 kg to 30 kg: 300 mg) every 4 weeks plus low-potency topical corticosteroids (hydrocortisone acetate 1% cream) for 16 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by age, baseline bodyweight, and region. Patient allocation was done via a central interactive web response system, and treatment allocation was masked. The primary endpoint at week 16 was the proportion of patients with IGA score 0-1 (clear or almost clear skin). The key secondary endpoint (coprimary endpoint for the EU and EU reference market) at week 16 was the proportion of patients with at least a 75% improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75). Primary analyses were done in the full analysis set (ie, all randomly assigned patients, as randomly assigned) and safety analyses were done in all patients who received any study drug. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, <a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03346434"" title=""See in ClinicalTrials.gov"">NCT03346434</a>. Findings: Between June 30, 2020, and Feb 12, 2021, 197 patients were screened for eligibility, 162 of whom were randomly assigned to receive dupilumab (n=83) or placebo (n=79) plus topical corticosteroids. At week 16, significantly more patients in the dupilumab group than in the placebo group had IGA 0-1 (23 [28%] vs three [4%], difference 24% [95% CI 13-34]; p 0·0001) and EASI-75 (44 [53%] vs eight [11%], difference 42% [95% CI 29-55]; p 0·0001). Overall prevalence of adverse events was similar in the dupilumab group (53 [64%] of 83 patients) and placebo group (58 [74%] of 78 patients). Conjunctivitis incidence was higher in the dupilumab group (four [5%]) than the placebo group (none). No dupilumab-related adverse events were serious or led to treatment discontinuation. Interpretation: Dupilumab significantly improved atopic dermatitis signs and symptoms versus placebo in children younger than 6 years. Dupilumab was well tolerated and showed an acceptable safety profile, similar to results in older children and adults. Funding: Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.",0.9998165965080261

Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, has been recently approved for the treatment of children aged 6-11 years with moderate-to-severe AD not adequately controlled with topical therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate in real life the effectiveness and safety of dupilumab in the treatment of children aged from 6 to 11 years. Methods: Demographic and clinical data of children aged 6-11 years, affected by moderate-to-severe AD and treated with dupilumab, were retrospectively collected from 24 dermatological and paediatric referral centres. Dupilumab was administered subcutaneously at an induction dose of 300 mg on day (D) 1, followed by 300 mg on D15 and 300 mg every 4 weeks.

Treatments for migraine aim to either prevent attacks before they have started or relieve attacks (abort) after onset of symptoms and range from complementary therapies to pharmacological interventions. A number of treatment-related adverse events such as somnolence, fatigue, and chest discomfort have previously been reported in association with triptans. The comparative tolerability of available agents for the abortive treatment of migraine attacks has not yet been systematically reviewed and quantified. Methods We performed a systematic literature review and Bayesian network meta-analysis for comparative tolerability of treatments for migraine. The literature search targeted all randomized controlled trials evaluating oral abortive treatments for acute migraine over a range of available doses in adults. The primary outcomes of interest were any adverse event, treatment-related adverse events, and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were fatigue, dizziness, chest discomfort, somnolence, nausea, and vomiting. Results Our search yielded 141 trials covering 15 distinct treatments. Of the triptans, sumatriptan, eletriptan, rizatriptan, zolmitriptan, and the combination treatment of sumatriptan and naproxen were associated with a statistically significant increase in odds of any adverse event or a treatment-related adverse event occurring compared with placebo. Of the non-triptans, only acetaminophen was associated with a statistically significant increase in odds of an adverse event occurring when compared with placebo. Overall, triptans were not associated with increased odds of serious adverse events occurring and the same was the case for non-triptans. For the secondary outcomes, with the exception of vomiting, all triptans except for almotriptan and frovatriptan were significantly associated with increased risk for all outcomes. Almotriptan was significantly associated with an increased risk of vomiting, whereas all other triptans yielded non-significant lower odds compared with placebo. Generally, the non-triptans were not associated with decreased tolerability for the secondary outcomes. Discussion In summary, triptans were associated with higher odds of any adverse event or a treatment-related adverse event occurring when compared to placebo and non-triptans. Non-significant results for non-triptans indicate that these treatments are comparable with one another and placebo regarding tolerability outcomes.",0.9998453855514526
122,2021,23065481,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,aleve migraine,0.0,"Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias are highly disabling primary headache disorders, characterized by severe unilateral head pain and associated ipsilateral cranial autonomic features. There is limited understanding of their pathophysiology and how and where treatments act to reduce symptoms; this is significantly hindered by a lack of animal models. We have developed the first animal model to explore trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, using stimulation within the brainstem, at the level of the superior salivatory nucleus, to activate the trigeminal autonomic reflex arc. Using electrophysiological recording of neurons of the trigeminocervical complex and laser Doppler blood flow changes around the ipsilateral lacrimal duct, superior salivatory nucleus stimulation exhibited both neuronal trigeminovascular and cranial autonomic manifestations. These responses were specifically inhibited by the autonomic ganglion blocker hexamethonium bromide. These data demonstrate that brainstem activation may be the driver of both sensory and autonomic symptoms in these disorders, and part of this activation may be via the parasympathetic outflow to the cranial vasculature. Additionally, both sensory and autonomic manifestations were significantly inhibited by highly effective treatments for trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, such as oxygen, indomethacin and triptans, and some part of their therapeutic action appears to be specifically on the parasympathetic outflow to the cranial vasculature. Treatments more used to migraine, such as naproxen and a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor inhibitor, olcegepant, were less effective in this model. This is the first model to represent the phenotype of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias and their response to therapies, and indicates the parasympathetic pathway may be uniquely involved in their pathophysiology and targeted to relieve symptoms.",0.9993664622306824
122,2021,22221151,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,aleve migraine,0.0,"The burden of migraine significantly impacts the individual sufferer, their families, the workplace, and society. The World Health Organization has identified migraine as an urgent public health priority and has initiated a global initiative to reduce the burden of migraine. Underlying the World Health Organization initiative is the need to discover means of optimizing migraine treatments and make them accessible to the broader portion of the world population. Development of acute migraine medications over the past several decades has largely centered on engineering highly specific receptor molecules that alter migraine pathophysiological mechanisms to abort or reverse the acute attack of migraine. The first product of this line of discovery was sumatriptan and heralded as a landmark therapeutic breakthrough. Sumatriptan is a 5-HT-1B/D receptor agonist considered to activate receptors involved in the pathophysiology specific to migraine. Large-scale regulatory/clinical studies demonstrated statistical superiority for sumatriptan over placebo in reduction or elimination of headache, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. Since the introduction of sumatriptan, 6 other triptan products have been released in the United States as acute treatments for migraine, all having the same mechanism of action and similar efficacy. Despite their utility as migraine abortive medications, the triptans do not successfully treat all attacks of migraine or necessarily treat all migraine associated symptoms. In fact, in less than 25% of attacks do subjects obtain and maintain a migraine-free response to treatment for at least beyond 24 hours. A wide range of non-triptan medications also have demonstrated efficacy in acute migraine. These include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, phenothiazines, and valproic acid to name a few. Given the distinctly different mechanisms of actions of these various medications, it is likely that several unique pathophysiological mechanisms are involved in terminating acute episodes of migraine. Clinicians now capitalize on this observation and use migraine medication in combination with another to improve patient outcomes, for example, using an antiemetic with an opioid or a triptan and NSAIDs. More recently, the Food and Drug Adminstration has approved a combination product containing 85mg of sumatriptan plus 500mg of naproxen sodium for acute treatment of migraine. Clinical trials conducted prior to approval demonstrated that the combination of sumatriptan and naproxen was more effective as a migraine abortive than either of its components but that each component and the combination were more effective than placebo. Exactly how sumatriptan and naproxen interact to create therapeutic synergism is unknown though its mere occurrence suggests that models assisting medical understanding and prediction of pharmacological synergism may improve clinical outcome over products acting through a single receptor mechanism. Migraine is a syndrome, meaning it is defined by observed symptoms rather than known pathophysiology. Multiple pathogenic mechanisms are likely involved in generating this diverse array of symptoms understood as the migraine symptom complex. Sumatriptan and naproxen have independent mechanisms of action and target distinct aspects of the vascular and inflammatory processes hypothesized to underlie migraine. Sumatriptan acts on the 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors, whereas naproxen inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. Sumatriptan has vasoconstricting effects as well as effects on neurogenic inflammation by decreasing the release of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide. In contrast, naproxen affects prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators. Because sumatriptan and naproxen both relieve migraine yet interact with different cellular targets within the migraine pathway, it is reasonable to assume there is a unique synergy between these medications that improves treatment outcomes. Clinical trials supported this contention by demonstrating the combination of sumatriptan/naproxen alleviated migraine pain quickly (primarily based on the sumatriptan mechanism of action), and sustained the response longer (primarily based on the naproxen mechanism of action) than is possible when either drug is given alone. The working hypothesis is that when sumatriptan and naproxen are given at the same time, they affect different mechanisms of the migraine pathway and produce an enhanced therapeutic effect. The purpose of this article is to apply statistical analyses to data from phase II and phase III studies of the combination of sumatriptan and naproxen to determine if this enhanced therapeutic effect is synergistic. This methodology of accessing synergy can be used in the development of future combination migraine treatments to improve treatment outcomes.",0.999717652797699
122,2021,20368903,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,aleve migraine,0.0,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including naproxen and naproxen sodium, are effective yet nonspecific analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, which work for a variety of pain and inflammatory syndromes, including migraine. In migraine, their analgesic effect helps relieve the headache, while their anti-inflammatory effect decreases the neurogenic inflammation in the trigeminal ganglion. This is the hypothesized mechanism by which they prevent the development of central sensitization. Triptans, including sumatriptan, work early in the migraine process at the trigeminovascular unit as agonists of the serotonin receptors (5-HT receptors) 1B and 1D. They block vasoconstriction and block transmission of signals to the trigeminal nucleus and thus prevent peripheral sensitization. Therefore, combining these two drugs is an attractive modality for the abortive treatment of migraine. Sumatriptan-naproxen fixed combination tablet (Treximet [sumatriptan-naproxen]) proves to be an effective and well tolerated drug that combines these two mechanisms; yet is far from being the ultimate in migraine abortive therapy, and further research remains essential.",0.9998241066932678
122,2021,20303198,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,aleve migraine,0.0,"Study objective: Multiple parenteral medications are used to treat migraine and other acute primary headaches in the emergency department (ED). Regardless of specific headache diagnosis, no medication eliminates the frequent recurrence of primary headache after ED discharge. It is uncertain which medication primary headache patients should be given on discharge from an ED. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of oral sumatriptan with naproxen for treatment of post-ED recurrent primary headache. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind efficacy trial. We randomized patients to either naproxen 500 mg or sumatriptan 100 mg for headache recurrence after ED discharge. Patients were eligible if they received parenteral therapy for an acute exacerbation of a primary headache in the ED. Patients who met established criteria for migraine without aura were designated a priori as a homogenous subgroup of interest. We followed all patients by telephone 48 hours after ED discharge. The primary endpoint was the between-group difference in change in pain intensity during the 2-hour period after ingestion of either 500 mg naproxen or 100 mg sumatriptan. This difference was measured on a validated 11-point (0 to 10) verbal numeric rating scale (NRS). Satisfaction with the medication and adverse effects were also assessed. Patients who met criteria for migraine without aura were analyzed twice according to a priori design: once as a homogenous subgroup and then again combined with all other primary headaches. Results: Of 410 patients randomized, 383 (93%) had outcome data available for analysis. Two hundred eighty (73%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 68% to 77%) reported headache post-ED discharge and 196 (51%; 95% CI 44% to 58%), including 88 with migraine, took the investigational medication provided to them. The naproxen group improved by a mean of 4.3 NRS points, whereas the sumatriptan group improved by 4.1 points (95% CI for difference of 0.2 points: -0.7 to 1.1 points). Findings were virtually identical among the migraine subset (4.3 versus 4.2 NRS points; 95% CI for difference of 0.1 points: -1.3 to 1.5 points). Seventy-one percent (95% CI 62% to 80%) of naproxen patients and 75% (95% CI 66% to 84%) of sumatriptan patients would want to take the same medication the next time. Adverse effect profiles were also comparable. Conclusion: In this trial, nearly three quarters of patients reported headache recurrence within 48 hours of ED discharge. Naproxen 500 mg and sumatriptan 100 mg taken orally relieve post-ED recurrent primary headache and migraine comparably. Clinicians should be guided by medication costs, contraindications, and a patient's previous experience with the medication.",0.9988840222358704

126,2021,36143865,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,"Background and Objectives : Probiotic supplementation can prevent and alleviate gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections in healthy individuals. Markers released from the site of inflammation are involved in the response to infection or tissue injury. Therefore, we measured the pre-exercise and postexercise levels of inflammation-related markers-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-γ, salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA), IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, and C-reactive protein (CRP)-in probiotic versus placebo groups to investigate the effects of probiotics on these markers in athletes. Probiotics contained multiple species (e.g., Bacillus subtilis, Bifidobacterium bifidum , etc.). Materials and Methods : We performed a systematic search for studies published until May 2022 and included nine randomized clinical trials. Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline. Fixed-effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed. Subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of the period of probiotic intervention and timing of postassessment blood sampling. Results : The levels of IFN-γ and salivary IgA exhibited a significant positive change, whereas those of TNF-α and IL-10 demonstrated a negative change in the probiotic group. The subgroup analysis revealed that the probiotic group exhibited significant negative changes in TNF-α and IL-10 levels in the shorter intervention period. For the subgroup based on the timing of postassessment blood sampling, the subgroup whose blood sample collection was delayed to at least the next day of exercise exhibited significant negative changes in their TNF-α and IL-10 levels. The subgroups whose blood samples were collected immediately after exercise demonstrated negative changes in their TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-10 levels. Conclusions : Probiotic supplementation resulted in significant positive changes in the IFN-γ and salivary IgA levels and negative changes in the IL-10 and TNF-α levels.

126,2021,36013241,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,"Mortality and morbidity from influenza and other respiratory viruses are significant causes of concern worldwide. Infections in the respiratory tract are often underappreciated because they tend to be mild and incapacitated. On the other hand, these infections are regarded as a common concern in clinical practice. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, albeit this is becoming more challenging since many of the more prevalent infection causes have acquired a wide range of antimicrobial resistance. Resistance to frontline treatment medications is constantly rising, necessitating the development of new antiviral agents. Probiotics are one of several medications explored to treat respiratory viral infection (RVI). As a result, certain probiotics effectively prevent gastrointestinal dysbiosis and decrease the likelihood of secondary infections. Various probiotic bacterias and their metabolites have shown immunomodulating and antiviral properties. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which probiotics are effective in the fight against viral infections are sometimes unclear. This comprehensive review has addressed probiotic strains, dosage regimens, production procedures, delivery systems, and pre-clinical and clinical research. In particular, novel probiotics' fight against RVIs is the impetus for this study. Finally, this review may explore the potential of probiotic bacterias and their metabolites to treat RVIs.

126,2021,36001877,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,"Background: Probiotics are live micro-organisms that may give a beneficial physiological effect when administered in adequate amounts. Some trials show that probiotic strains can prevent respiratory infections. Even though our previously published review showed the benefits of probiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), several new studies have been published. This is an update of a review first published in 2011 and updated in 2015. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose), compared with placebo or no treatment, in the prevention of acute URTIs in people of all ages, at risk of acute URTIs. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2022, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to May week 2, 2022), Embase (1974 to 10 May 2022), Web of Science (1900 to 10 May 2022), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, which includes the China Biological Medicine Database (from 1978 to 10 May 2022), the Chinese Medicine Popular Science Literature Database (from 2000 to 10 May 2022), and the Master's Degree Dissertation of Beijing Union Medical College Database (from 1981 to 10 May 2022). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for completed and ongoing trials on 10 May 2022. Selection criteria: We included individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs comparing probiotics with placebo or no treatment to prevent acute URTIs. The participants were children, adults, or the elderly in the community, care facilities, schools, or hospitals. Our main outcomes were the number of participants diagnosed with URTIs (at least one event and at least three events), the incidence rate (number of cases/person year) of acute URTIs, and the mean duration of an episode of URTIs. Our secondary outcomes were the number of participants who were absent from childcare centre, school, or work due to acute URTIs; the number of participants who used prescribed antibiotics for acute URTIs; and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event from probiotics. We excluded studies if they did not specify acute respiratory infections as 'upper'; studies with more than 50% of participants vaccinated against influenza or other acute URTIs within the last 12 months; and studies with significantly different proportions of vaccinated participants between the probiotics arm and the placebo or no treatment arm. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials and extracted data using standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We analysed both intention-to-treat and per-protocol data and used a random-effects model. We expressed results as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included 23 individual RCTs and one cluster-RCT. As one of the individual RCTs did not report outcomes in a usable way, we could only meta-analyse data from 23 trials, involving a total of 6950 participants including children (aged from one month to 11 years old), adults (mean age 37.3), and older people (mean age 84.6 years). One trial reported 22.5% flu-vaccine participants within the last 12 months, and 25.4% flu-vaccine participants during the intervention. Probiotics were more likely to be given with milk-based food in children; administered in powder form in adults; and given with milk-based food or in capsules in the elderly. Most of the studies used one or two strains (e.g. Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL9, Lactobacillus paracasei (8700:2 or N1115)) and 10<sup>9</sup> or 10<sup>11</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/day of probiotics for more than three months. We found that probiotics may reduce the number of participants diagnosed with URTIs (at least one event) (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87; P 0.001; 16 studies, 4798 participants; low-certainty evidence); likely reduce the number of participants diagnosed with URTIs (at least three events) (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.91; P = 0.02; 4 studies, 763 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); may reduce the incidence rate (number of cases/person year) of URTIs (rate ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92, P = 0.001; 12 studies, 4364 participants; low-certainty evidence); may reduce the mean duration of an episode of acute URTIs (MD -1.22 days, 95% CI -2.12 to -0.33; P = 0.007; 6 studies, 2406 participants; low-certainty evidence); likely reduce the number of participants who used prescribed antibiotics for acute URTIs (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.81; P = 0.001; 6 studies, 1548 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and may not increase the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.15; P = 0.79; 8 studies, 2456 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence showing a decrease in the number of people absent from childcare centre, school, or work due to acute URTIs with probiotics is very uncertain (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.59; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events from probiotics were minor, and most commonly gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea, and bowel pain.

Many dietary supplements on the market claim to have anti-COVID-19 effects without scientific evidence. To elucidate the prevalence of dietary supplement usage for the prevention of COVID-19, we conducted an online cross-sectional questionnaire survey among Japanese adults in January 2022. The prevalence of dietary supplement use for the prevention of COVID-19 was 8.3%, and there was no gender difference. We also conducted additional research on these dietary supplement users (1000 males and 1000 females). The most popular ingredient used was vitamin C (61.0%), with vitamin D (34.9%) and probiotics (33.4%) following. Half of these participants reported using supplements for more than one year. The information sources that reportedly led them to start using dietary supplements for the prevention of COVID-19 were the Internet (44.0%), television and radio (29.9%), and family or friends (26.0%), and these information sources differed among generations. In conclusion, some of the population used vitamin/mineral supplements for the prevention of COVID-19 that might be beneficial for their health, but some used ingredients with no scientifically proven effects against the virus at this time.

However, the utilization efficiency of carbohydrates is very poor in fish. Over consumption of carbohydrates will cause excessive inflammatory response and result in lower pathogen resistance in fish. Probiotics have been widely used to prevent inflammation, but the underlying mechanism still needs more exploration. In this study, three diets, including a control diet (CD), a high-carbohydrate diet (HD) and the HD supplemented with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SS1 (HDB) were used to feed Nile tilapia for 10 weeks. At the end of the feeding trial, fish were challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) for 7 days. The data showed that the addition of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SS1 (B. amyloliquefaciens SS1) significantly increased the survival rate and enhanced the respiratory burst activity of head kidney leukocytes in Nile tilapia. B. amyloliquefaciens SS1 treatment significantly elevated the anti-oxidative capability, which was evidenced by higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and higher content of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the serum. Administration with B. amyloliquefaciens SS1 effectively suppressed inflammatory response in the liver by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)/interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) inflammatory signaling pathway. In vitro analysis suggested that intestinal bacteria derived-acetate has the antioxidant capability, which may account for the alleviation of inflammation. Overall, this study demonstrated that dietary supplementation with B. amyloliquefaciens SS1 protected Nile Tilapia against A. hydrophila infection and suppressed liver inflammation by enhancing antioxidant capability.",0.999821126461029

On the mucosa, the respiratory microbiota interacts with potential pathogenic viruses, bacteria and the host immune system, including secretory IgA (sIgA). This review discusses the role of the respiratory microbiota and its interaction with the (mucosal) immune system in RTI susceptibility, as well as the potential to exploit the microbiota to promote health and prevent RTIs. Recent findings: Recent studies confirm that specific microbiota profiles are associated with RTI susceptibility and during susceptibility and found accompanying RTIs, although clear associations have not yet been found for SARS-CoV-2 infection. sIgA plays a central role in RTI pathogenesis: it stands under control of the local microbiota, while at the same time influencing bacterial gene expression, metabolism and defense mechanisms. Respiratory microbiota interventions are still newly emerging but promising candidates for probiotics to prevent RTIs, such as Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum species, have been identified. Summary: Improved understanding of the respiratory microbiota in RTIs and its interplay with the immune system is of importance for early identification and follow-up of individuals at risk of infection. It also opens doors for future microbiota interventions by altering the microbiota towards a healthier state to prevent and/or adjunctively treat RTIs.",0.9984080195426941

Limited data suggest that aromatherapy massage and reflexology may help to reduce pain and fatigue in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study was to examine and compare the effects of aromatherapy massage and reflexology on pain and fatigue in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The study sample was randomly assigned to either an aromatherapy massage (n = 17), reflexology (n = 17) or the control group (n = 17). Aromatherapy massage was applied to both knees of subjects in the first intervention group for 30 minutes. Reflexology was administered to both feet of subjects in the second intervention group for 40 minutes during weekly home visits. Control group subjects received no intervention. Fifty-one subjects with rheumatoid arthritis were recruited from a university hospital rheumatology clinic in Turkey between July 2014 and January 2015 for this randomized controlled trial. Data were collected by personal information form, DAS28 index, Visual Analog Scale and Fatigue Severity Scale. Pain and fatigue scores were measured at baseline and within an hour after each intervention for 6 weeks. Pain and fatigue scores significantly decreased in the aromatherapy massage and reflexology groups compared with the control group (p .05). The reflexology intervention started to decrease mean pain and fatigue scores earlier than aromatherapy massage (week 1 vs week 2 for pain, week 1 vs week 4 for fatigue) (p .05). Aromatherapy massage and reflexology are simple and effective nonpharmacologic nursing interventions that can be used to help manage pain and fatigue in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",0.9998745918273926

129,2021,36169916,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,"Male androgenetic alopecia is a common condition and represents a major concern for patients who experience this condition. While there are different treatments to stop hair loss and improve hair density, the 5-alpha reductase inhibitors have demonstrated to be effective in improving androgenetic alopecia in men and can maintain a positive response for many years. Oral finasteride 1 mg is a US FDA-approved option, but dutasteride 0.5 mg has been proven to induce better responses, especially in the frontal area. Both have been shown to be safe in clinical trials but there is widespread concern about sexual adverse effects among patients. The use of topical finasteride has increased during the last few years as a useful option to avoid systemic therapy. The efficacy of topical finasteride 0.25% daily has been demonstrated in clinical trials, with a less marked decrease in serum dihydrotestosterone levels than with oral intake. Mesotherapy with dutasteride has also become more widespread recently, although evidence of its effectiveness is limited to retrospective studies in real clinical practice. The use of oral minoxidil in androgenetic alopecia has not been approved by the FDA, however several clinical studies have shown that it is an effective treatment option. The initial dose recommended to treat male hair loss is 2.5 mg daily, although the dose is frequently increased to 5 mg daily. The main adverse effect of oral minoxidil is hypertrichosis, followed by dizziness or lower limb edema, which are much less common. Platelet-rich plasma is a non-pharmacological option to treat male androgenetic alopecia, with some clinical trials demonstrating an improvement in hair count after several months. Among the published studies, the main limitation to compare its efficacy is the heterogeneity of the procedure. The most frequent regimens propose treatment every 4 weeks for 3 months initially to assess the individual response. Another treatment alternative is the use of light devices with wavelengths of between 630 and 660 nm, known as low-level laser therapy. These devices can be used at home every day for 15-30 min. Their efficacy has been shown in a limited number of clinical trials; however, there is a lack of evidence about the efficacy of these devices compared with other medical options or as a complementary therapy in hair loss. The pipeline of potential new treatments for male androgenetic alopecia is strong. Pyrilutamide and GT20029 are being studied as topical antagonists of the androgen receptor, while cetirizine is another topical option with some initial promising results. Furthermore, according to isolated studies with heterogeneous treatment schemes, the use of botulinum toxin in the scalp might improve androgenetic alopecia, and lastly, scalp threading might increase the total hair count as growth factors are released during implantation.",0.9998262524604797
129,2021,36054045,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,"Background: Laser pretreatment with cosmeceutical topicals is growing in popularity. However, lasers may also enhance the uptake of medical topicals that treat dermatologic conditions, such as vitiligo, alopecia, and cancerous and precancerous lesions. Permeation of these topicals must be quantified to optimize treatment protocols. Objective: To analyze transdermal uptake of 3 topicals after nonablative fractional 1,550-nm erbium-doped glass or 1,927-nm thulium fiber laser pretreatment. Methods and materials: Human donor tissue was pretreated with a nonablative fractional 1,550-nm erbium-doped glass or 1,927-nm thulium fiber laser followed by application of 0.03% bimatoprost, 0.5% 5-fluorouracil, or 5% minoxidil. Permeation and retention were measured over 24 hours (bimatoprost and 5-fluorouracil) or 90 minutes (minoxidil), and uptake was calculated. Results: Pretreatment with 1,927-nm thulium laser (500 MTZ/cm2; 5 mJ; 5 W) enhanced uptake and retention of bimatoprost versus untreated control at 24 hours post-treatment. Pretreatment with 1,550-nm erbium-doped glass laser (2,000 MTZ/cm2; 10 mJ; 30 W) enhanced permeation, uptake, and retention of 5-fluorouracil at 24 hours post-treatment and enhanced permeation and uptake of minoxidil at 90 minutes post-treatment. Conclusion: Nonablative laser pretreatment may enhance topical treatment of dermatologic conditions. Device settings must be optimized to maximize topical permeation while minimizing laser-associated thermal side effects.",0.9997861981391907
129,2021,36039391,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,"Background: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a common chronic dermatological illness that affects both men and women. Aim: To assess and compare dermoscopically the impact of a combination of topical minoxidil solution (5%) and topical spironolactone solution (5%) in treating AGA in both sexes. Patients and methods: One hundred and twenty patients diagnosed with AGA were divided into three groups; each group is composed of 40 patients. Group A (n = 40) were treated with a 5% topical minoxidil solution, group B (n = 40) were treated with a 5% topical spironolactone solution, and group C (n = 40) were treated with a 5% topical minoxidil and spironolactone combination. Results: Following the initiation of treatment and at 6 weeks (midterm), reduction in all dermoscopic features was observed in all groups; however, it was not statistically significant except for vellus hair reduction (p = 0.033). On the contrary, upright regrowing hairs were insignificantly increased in all groups (p = 1.088). The pattern of dermoscopic features remained to insignificantly decrease toward the end of 12 weeks treatment (full term) in all studied groups except for vellus hair that showed further significant reduction toward the end of the study (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Both spironolactone as a 5% topical solution and minoxidil as a 5% topical solution might be used safely in a twice-daily dosage to treat AGA in both genders.

129,2021,35978863,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,"Alopecia is a health condition in which the hair loses its function in some or all of the body. Alopecia occurs due to various genetic, environmental, and nutritional factors. One of the methods developed to treat alopecia is through inhibition of the enzyme 5- α -reductase, which converts testosterone into its more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In ethnomedicine, the leaves of Merremia peltata are used by the people of Sulawesi as a remedy for baldness. Therefore, in this study, an in vivo study was conducted on rabbits to investigate the antialopecia activity of the ethanolic extract of M. peltata leaves. The purified M. peltata leaf extract was fractionated using vacuum liquid chromatography with several solvents to produce fractions F1-F5. Each fraction was then retested in vivo in rabbits, and its content was then analyzed by LC-MS. An in silico study was then carried out using minoxidil as a comparison ligand; 17 compounds derived from M. peltata leaves were identified as antialopecia compounds through prediction of molecular interactions and molecular dynamics simulation and prediction of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicology (ADME-Tox). The assay results showed that fractions F2 and F3 had a better effect on hair growth compared to the positive control, and the test compound obtained from the LC-MS analysis, bufotalinin, had a strong binding energy to the receptor in the molecular docking interaction study: -5.99 kcal/mol compared to -4.8 kcal/mol for minoxidil. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis with complex stability parameters based on solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), principal component analysis (PCA), root mean square deviation (RMSD), and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) showed that bufotalinin has good affinity for androgen receptors. ADME-Tox prediction for bufotalinin showed good results for the parameters of skin permeability, absorption, and distribution. Therefore, bufotalinin, a steroid compound, is a potential androgen receptor antagonist and could be useful in the treatment of alopecia.",0.0009353261557407677
129,2021,35976667,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,"Importance: Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disorder of hair loss with a complex and evolving treatment landscape, making it an ideal setting for shared decision-making (SDM) between patients and physicians. Given the varying efficacy, experience, and risks of treatments for AA, we sought to evaluate patient preferences for SDM and the association of SDM with decisional regret. Objective: To evaluate patient preferences for SDM and the association of SDM with decisional regret. Design, setting, and participants: A cross-sectional online survey using the validated SDMQ9 scale for shared decision-making and Decisional Regret Scale (DRS) was distributed using the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF) with the aim of assessing (1) patient preferences in SDM when making treatment decisions, (2) how patients perceived the last decision to have been made, (3) which components of SDM were incorporated into the last decision, and (4) decisional regret related to their last treatment decision. The survey was distributed from July 12, 2021, to August 2, 2021, and data analysis occurred from October 2021 to March 2022. Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes included (1) patient preferences in incorporation of SDM, (2) how patients made their most recent treatment decision, (3) which components of SDM were incorporated into their most recent treatment decision measured with the validated SDMQ9, and (4) an assessment of decisional regret in relation to SDM components and the most recent treatment modality used by the patient as measured by the validated DRS. Results: Of 1387 individuals who initiated the survey, 1074 completed it and were included in the analysis (77.4% completion rate). Overall, 917 respondents were women (85.4%). There were 5 American Indian or Alaska Native respondents (0.5%), 33 were Asian (3.1%), 112 Black or African American (10.4%), 836 White (77.8%), and 36 were multiracial (3.4%) or other (36 [3.4%]). The mean age (SD) was 49.3 (15.4) years. Most respondents preferred making the final treatment decision themselves after considering their physician's opinion (503 [46.8%]). Of those who preferred to make treatment decisions using SDM, most made the last AA treatment decision with their physician (596 [55%]; 95% CI, 53%-58%; P .001). The components of SDM implemented by the patients' dermatologists most identified were the physician ""explained the advantages and disadvantages of treatment options"" (472 [44%]), and the physician ""asked me which treatment option I prefer"" (494 [45.9%]). Incorporation of SDM by physicians was generally associated with decreased decisional regret (all ORs with 95% CIs greater than 1.1; P .01). The treatments associated with the lowest decisional regret were Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, followed by biologics, and deciding not to treat; whereas, the highest decisional regret was reported with anthralin and minoxidil. Conclusions and relevance: The findings of this cross-sectional survey study suggest that patients with AA prefer to make treatment decisions with their dermatologist using SDM. When SDM is used, patients report less decisional regret, indicating that SDM may help improve the patient-reported quality of treatment decisions. Newer, more efficacious therapies such as JAK inhibitors may be related to lower decisional regret. Future studies should seek to devise solutions to implement SDM as the AA treatment landscape continues to evolve.",0.9992220401763916

However, there is little data on its use in pediatrics, and there are no recommended treatment guidelines. Adverse events are of particular concern in this population. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 63 patients aged between 0 and 12 years from a specialist hair clinic who were treated with LDOM or sublingual minoxidil (SM) to evaluate its safety and tolerability. LDOM and SM were generally well-tolerated, with mild hypertrichosis being the most commonly reported adverse event.

129,2021,35961471,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,"Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), the most prevalent type of hair loss in clinic, is induced partly by insufficient perifollicular vascularization. Here we designed a dissolvable microneedles (MNs) patch that was loaded with conditioned media (CM) derived from hypoxia-pretreated mesenchymal stem cells, which contained elevated HIF-1α. The CM-integrated MNs patch (designated as CM-MNs) can puncture the stratum corneum and deliver the pro-angiogenic factors directly into skin in a one-step and minimally invasive manner. Meanwhile, the administration of CM-MNs induced a certain mechanical stimulation on the skin, which can also promote neovascularization. With the combined effects of the pro-angiogenic factors in CM and the mechanical stimulation induced by MNs, CM-MNs successfully boosted perifollicular vascularization, and activated hair follicle stem cells, thereby inducing notably faster hair regeneration at a lower administration frequency on AGA mouse model compared with minoxidil. Furthermore, we proved that the inhibition of perifollicular angiogenesis restrained the awakening of hair follicle stem cells, elucidating the tight correlation between perifollicular angiogenesis and the activation of hair follicle stem cells. The innovative integration of CM and MNs holds great promise for clinical AGA treatment and indicates that boosting angiogenesis around hair follicles is an effective strategy against AGA.",0.00043411331716924906

The theoretical basis is that steam may help congested mucus drain better and that heat may destroy the cold virus as it does in vitro. This is an update of a review last published in 2013. Objectives: To assess the effects of inhaling heated water vapour (steam) in the treatment of the common cold by comparing symptoms, viral shedding, and nasal resistance. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (to February 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to 24 February 2017), Embase (1990 to 24 February 2017), and Current Contents (1998 to 24 February 2017). We also searched World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (8 March 2017) and ClinicalTrials.gov (8 March 2017) as well as reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials using heated water vapour in participants with the common cold or experimentally induced common cold were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Three review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion of potential studies identified from the search. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram. We used a data collection form for study characteristics and outcome data that was developed and used for previous versions of this review. Two review authors independently extracted data, and a third review author resolved any disagreements. We used Review Manager 5 software to analyse data. Main results: We included six trials from five publications involving a total of 387 participants. We included no new studies in this 2017 update. The 'Risk of bias' assessment suggested an unclear risk of bias in the domain of randomisation and a low risk of bias in performance, detection, attrition, and reporting.It was uncertain whether heated, humidified air provides symptomatic relief for the common cold, as the fixed-effect analysis showed evidence of an effect (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.56; 2 studies, 149 participants), but the random-effects analysis showed no significant difference in the results (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.95). There is an argument for using either form of analysis. No studies demonstrated an exacerbation of clinical symptom scores. One study conducted in the USA demonstrated worsened nasal resistance, but an earlier Israeli study showed improvement. One study examined viral shedding in nasal washings, finding no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.19). As judged by the subjective response to therapy (i.e. therapy did not help), the number of participants reporting resolution of symptoms was not significantly higher in the heated humidified group (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.18; 2 studies, 124 participants). There was significant heterogeneity in the effects of heated, humidified air on different outcomes, therefore we graded the quality of the evidence as low. Some studies reported minor adverse events (including discomfort or irritation of the nose). Authors' conclusions: The current evidence does not show any benefits or harms from the use of heated, humidified air delivered via the RhinoTherm device for the treatment of the common cold. There is a need for more double-blind, randomised trials that include standardised treatment modalities.",0.9995025396347046

Selection criteria: Randomized trials using heated water vapour in a standardized way in patients with the common cold or volunteers with experimental induction of rhinovirus infection were included in the review. Data collection and analysis: All the articles retrieved were initially subjected to a review for inclusion / exclusion criteria. Review articles, editorials, abstracts with inadequate outcome description were excluded. Studies selected for inclusion were subjected to a methodological assessment. Main results: The results of a systematic review of six trials with 319 participants, support the use of warm vapour inhalations in the common cold in terms of relief of symptoms (Odds Ratio with 95 % CI 0.31, 0.16-0.60, Relative risk 0.56, 0.4-0.79). Results on symptom score indices were equivocal. None of the studies demonstrated a worsening of clinical symptom scores. One study demonstrated increased nasal resistance one week after steam inhalation in contrast to an earlier study which showed improvement in the nasal resistance. There was no evidence of decreased viral shedding measured by virus isolation in the nasal secretions (Tyrrell 1989a) or measurement of viral titres in nasal washings among treatment group. The rhinovirus titres in the nasal washings from the treatment group were the same as those of the placebo group on day one prior to the treatment and on all four days after the treatment. The area under curve (Hendley 1994) was also similar in the placebo and treatment groups for titres of virus in the nasal washings as were the average viral titres across five days of follow up, the maximum values after treatment, and viral shedding velocity i.e. amount of virus shed per day (Hendley 1994). Minor side effects due to thermal stress were reported in all the studies. Reviewers' conclusions: Three trials demonstrated beneficial effects on the symptoms of the common cold. One study from Israel showed a decrease in nasal resistance measured by peak nasal expiratory and inspiratory flow rate.

One study demonstrated increased nasal resistance one week after steam inhalation in contrast to an earlier study which showed improvement in the nasal resistance. There was no evidence of decreased viral shedding measured by virus isolation in the nasal secretions or measurement of viral titres in nasal washings among treatment group. The rhinovirus titres in the nasal washings from the treatment group were the same as those of the placebo group on day one prior to the treatment and on all four days after the treatment. The area under curve was also similar in the placebo and treatment groups for titres of virus in the nasal washings as were the average viral titres across five days of follow up, the maximum values after treatment, and viral shedding velocity i.e. amount of virus shed per day. Minor side effects due to thermal stress were reported in all the studies. Reviewer's conclusions: Three trials demonstrated beneficial effects on the symptoms of the common cold. One study from Israel showed a decrease in nasal resistance measured by peak nasal expiratory and inspiratory flow rate. Studies done in North America failed to show any objective improvement in outcome measures with the study intervention. A multi-centre double blind randomised controlled trial testing this therapy with uniform outcome measures is recommended.",0.999762237071991

The cold-related knowledge and beliefs of adults seeking medical care for themselves or their children may not correspond with current medical opinion. Methods: A total of 249 parents of symptomatic children and 257 symptomatic adults who sought medical advice in the spring of 1997 from 1 of 3 primary care clinics in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, area were surveyed by telephone 48 to 96 hours after contact with the medical system. Results: Of the adults seeking care for a child or themselves, 44% believed viruses alone cause the common cold: an additional 42% believed both viruses and bacteria play a role. Most thought rest (97%) and nonprescription medications (63%) were helpful for colds, which was consistent with published reports. Contrary to medical reports, however, most felt vitamin C (67%) and the inhalation of steam (70%) reduced cold symptoms, and 44% believed antibiotics help colds (chi2=19.57; P=.0002). But 85% believed colds could resolve on their own. Conclusions: Those adults seeking medical care for uncomplicated colds are misinformed about the primary cause of the common cold, the use of prescription medications for treating cold symptoms, and the effectiveness of some palliative care techniques.

Although exercise is recommended in their daily routine to improve quality of life, little is known about how CFS codiagnosis affects that. Using scientifically validated questionnaires, we evaluated the psychological state and quality of life of patients with FM (n = 70) and how habitual physical exercise (HPE) reported by patients with only FM (FM-only n = 38) or codiagnosed with CFS (FM + CFS, n = 32) influences those aspects. An age-matched reference group of ""healthy"" women without FM (RG, n = 70) was used. The FM-only group presented a worse psychological state and quality of life compared to RG, with no influence of CFS codiagnosis. The patients of the FM-only and FM + CFS groups who perform HPE presented better levels of stress and state anxiety, but with no differences between them. Depression and trait anxiety improved only in women with just FM. CFS codiagnosis does not worsen the psychological and quality of life impairment of FM patients and does not have a great influence on the positive effect of HPE.",0.0036925089079886675

The addition of the traditional herbal medicine Hochuekkito (TJ-41) treatment to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has been reported to improve dyspnea and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with COPD. However, the reason for this improvement is not sufficiently understood. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the addition of TJ-41 treatment to PR improves symptoms of apathy, dyspnea, and HRQOL and increases physical activity among apathetic patients with COPD. Apathetic patients with COPD were randomly assigned to receive low-intensity exercise with (TJ-41 group) or without (control group) TJ-41 treatment for 12 weeks. A total of 29.9% of COPD patients had apathetic symptoms without severe depression. After the 12-week treatment, Apathy Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, visual analog scale for dyspnea, and COPD assessment test energy scores decreased significantly in the TJ-41 group ( p &amp;lt; 0.05), but not in the control group. Additionally, the total number of steps taken was significantly higher in the TJ-41 group than in the control group. TJ-41 combined with PR may benefit apathetic patients with COPD with respect to apathy, dyspnea, HRQOL, and physical activity, but larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are required to validate the findings because of the small sample size and lack of placebo controls in this study.",0.7031551003456116
133,2021,36227637,Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,exercise depression,1.0,"Background: Chronic low back pain is challenging to manage due to multidisciplinary considerations. It has substantial socioeconomic impacts and cannot be simply treated with pharmacotherapy, nonsurgical intervention, or spine surgery. Medical consensus recommends optimizing conservative self-management therapies (eg, home exercise, wellness strategies, yoga, etc) as first-line treatment options for chronic low back pain. However, access to these modalities is often limited and secondary to cost, convenience, and ease of use. Mobile health apps have emerged as a cost-effective and accessible option for chronic low back pain self-management. Established in-person pain programs can provide the structure for an optimal mobile app adaptation. PainNavigator (PainNavigator, Inc) is an example of a mobile app that is based on an Ascension-Illinois group-based pain program-Pain Rehabilitation Outpatient-Camp. Objective: This was a prospective pilot clinical trial that evaluated the PainNavigator platform's utility in low back pain management to inform future trial development. Methods: A total of 75 participants who used PainNavigator were studied. Pain, Enjoyment, and General Activity (PEG-3) scale scores and scores from a brief anxiety and depression scale based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) were obtained at baseline and following program completion. The PEG-3 total score was used, in addition to individual items-Average Pain, Pain Effect on Enjoyment, and Pain Effect on Activity. The PHQ-4 total score was also used, in addition to other individual items, including Felt Depressed, Loss of Interest, Felt Anxious, and Difficult to Control Worry. Paired sample t tests (2-tailed) compared mean differences in scores from before and after participants received the intervention. Results: The analysis found that PEG-3 (n=27) and PHQ-4 (n=27) total scores were significantly lower upon the completion of PainNavigator (P .001 and P=.001, respectively). The findings showed a 36% reduction in PEG-3 total scores, a 40% reduction in pain intensity, and a 40% reduction in PHQ-4 total scores. Scores for individual PEG-3 scale and PHQ-4 items also significantly decreased. All PEG-3 measures had large effect sizes. The PHQ-4 total score and Difficult to Control Worry item had large effect sizes, while the other three measures had medium effect sizes. Conclusions: These findings show that PainNavigator has clinical significance in managing chronic low back pain and can be easily utilized to improve patient care. All PEG-3 scale and PHQ-4 measures significantly improved following the use of the platform, supporting the multidimensional, biopsychosocial approach to low back pain management. Differences in effect sizes may inform quality improvement investigations, such as optimizing features that impact measures with only medium effect sizes. This feasibility study demonstrates an effective protocol, and it will inform future, more extensive randomized controlled trials.",0.9997385144233704
133,2021,36226304,Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,exercise depression,1.0,"Objective: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of mind-body exercise on global cognitive function, depression, sleep disorders, fatigue level, and quality of life (QOL) in a Parkinson's disease (PD) population. Methods: Total six English and Chinese databases were searched for articles published up to May 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating mind-body excises on non-motor symptoms of PD were included. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality, and we defined high-quality studies as having a low risk of bias in four or more domains. Global cognitive function was considered the primary outcome and was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The secondary outcomes included QOL, fatigue, depression, and sleep quality, which were measured using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), 16-item Parkinson's Disease Fatigue Scale (PFS-16), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and revised Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS-2), respectively. Subgroup analyses were conducted for global cognitive function and QOL to assess the optimal treatment measure across the various mind-body exercises. Results: Fourteen RCTs with 404 patients were finally included in the meta-analysis. Eight (57.14%) studies were of high quality. The pooled results showed that mind-body exercises generally had a significant advantage over the control intervention in improving global cognitive function (MD = 1.68; P = 0.0008). The dose subgroup analysis revealed that the low dose (60-120 min per week) and moderate dose (120-200 min per week) significantly increased MoCA scores compared with the control group (MD = 2.11, P = 0.01; MD = 1.27, P = 0.02, respectively). The duration subgroup analysis indicated a significant difference in the effect of the duration (6-10 and &gt;15 weeks) on increasing MoCA scores compared with the control group (MD = 3.74, P 0.00001; MD = 1.45, P = 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: Mind-body exercise may improve global cognitive function, sleep quality, and QOL in the PD population. In addition, low to moderate doses and appropriate durations significantly improved global cognitive function.

Methods: Data on stress, health-related quality of life, shoulder pain, shoulder disability, and depression were collected from 565 women aged 35-64 years living in Seoul, South Korea, from May 13 to 23, 2021, using a self-reported, structured survey. SPSS PROCESS macro (Model 6) and serial mediation analysis were used to analyze the relationship between stress and health-related quality of life among participants, with shoulder pain, shoulder disability, and depression as mediators. Results: The results indicate that stress had a statistically direct impact on health-related quality of life. In the serial mediation analysis, shoulder pain, disability, and depression were found to be statistically significant, thus affecting the relationship between stress and health-related quality of life, with an explanatory power of 33%. Therefore, the relationship between stress and health-related quality of life was partially mediated by these variables. Conclusions: Thus, this study suggests the need for healthcare workers to develop methods, such as exercise intervention programs based on various degrees and types of physical activity, to improve health-related quality of life and reduce stress caused by shoulder pain, shoulder disability, and depression among middle-aged women.",0.9983880519866943

Methods: Three independent reviewers searched for randomized controlled trials that applied exercise interventions with depressive symptoms as an outcome measure for patients with PD on PubMed and Web of Science up to February 28, 2022. Random effects meta-analyses were performed, in which standardized mean differences (SMDs) between the effects of exercise and control interventions on depressive symptoms with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: A total of 19 randomized controlled trials including 1,302 PD patients were eligible for meta-analysis, and we obtained 23 comparisons from the included studies for data synthesis. Physical exercise interventions showed significant effects on the reduction in depressive symptoms in PD patients (SMD=0.829; 95% CI=0.516 to 1.142; P 0.001). Moderator analyses on exercise type revealed significant positive effects for combined exercise interventions (SMD=1.111; 95% CI=0.635 to 1.587; P 0.001), whereas aerobic training alone failed to show significant effects (SMD=0.202; 95% CI =-0.045 to 0.449; P =0.108). With respect to exercise intensity, both light-to-moderate intensity exercises (SMD=0.971; 95% CI=0.521 to 1.421; P 0.001) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercises (SMD=0.779; 95% CI=0.407 to 1.152; P 0.001) significantly improved depressive symptoms with a small difference between the exercise intensities. Conclusion: Our results suggest that physical exercise has significant antidepressant effects in PD patients. These effects appeared to be more closely associated with exercise type than intensity. Different types of exercise interventions may result in greater benefit and require further investigation.",0.999859094619751

Objective: to identify the physiotherapeutic strategies used in the treatment of patients with LAM. Materials and methods: This is a systematic review of literature. Searches were performed (in PubMed, Lilacs, Embase and PEDro databases) with the keywords ""Lymphangioleiomyomatosis"" and ""Physiotherapy,"" and its variations. Articles describing physiotherapy interventions were included in the study. Data extracted from the studies were authors, year, country of publication, sample size, physiotherapy intervention, time/frequency/duration of intervention protocols, instruments used to measure results and main findings. Methodological quality of studies was evaluated by PEDro Scale (clinical trials), Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS; observational studies) and CARE checklist (case reports), respectively. Results: A total of 82 articles identified, three duplicates were removed, 71 studies were excluded after title and abstract reading and four after full-text reading, all due to absence of association with the study topic. Four studies were included in the present review. Cardiorespiratory physiotherapy with endurance and resistance training were identified as physiotherapeutic strategies to improve lung function, functional capacity, depression symptoms and quality of life in LAM.

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data sources: PubMed, CINAHL, Science Direct, PEDro, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to the end of March 2022. Eligibility criteria and outcomes: RCTs investigating the effects of telerehabilitation in the management of patients with COVID-19 were included. The outcomes of interest were functional capacity, cardiopulmonary exercise tests, quality of life and other variables where data are available. Data extraction and synthesis: Two reviewers screened, extracted data and performed methodological quality assessment independently. The revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Review Manager V.5.4 and Stata V.14.0 software were used for statistical analysis. Mean difference (MD) with 95% CI and the corresponding p value were used to determine the treatment effect between groups. A fixed-effect model was used for all variables as no significant heterogeneity was observed. Results: Four studies with 334 patients with COVID-19 were included. The pooled result of telerehabilitation showed statistically significant improvement on 6-minute walking test (MD 75.50; 95% CI 54.69 to 96.30; p=0.48), 30-second sit-to-stand test (MD 1.76; 95% CI 1.47 to 2.04; p=0.30), Borg Scale (MD 2.49; 95% CI 2.16 to 2.83; p=0.28) and level of dyspnoea (MD 6.26; 95% CI 5.42 to 7.10; p=0.66). The overall treatment completion rate was 88.46%, and the most common reason for withdrawal after randomisation was lost to follow-up or uncooperativeness. Conclusions: The findings showed that telerehabilitation interventions could improve functional capacity and exercise perception among patients affected by COVID-19 and can be implemented with a high completion rate and minimal adverse events. However, more studies are required to investigate the effects on cardiopulmonary function, quality of life, anxiety, depression and other variables.

133,2021,36187685,Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,exercise depression,1.0,"Under the epidemic situation of COVID-19, university students have different levels of anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems, and these differing levels present different challenges. Therefore, universities and relevant departments should carry out accurate psychological health education for university students. Through research, this paper found that students' psychological problems during the COVID-19 epidemic were mainly reflected in four aspects: depression, interpersonal relationship, sleep and eating disorders, and compulsive behavior. Through the discussion of family of origin, self-awareness and motivation attribution, and social pressure, this paper analyzed the causes of psychological problems. The information resources of the network are usually unstructured data, and the text information, as the most typical unstructured data, occupies a large proportion. Moreover, this text information often contains users' emotional response to major events. In this paper, a data preprocessing system is designed, and three data preprocessing rules are defined: expression data conversion rules, data deduplication rules and invalid data cleaning rules. The characteristics of online community text data are analyzed, and the text feature extraction method is selected according to its characteristics. The results of this study show that the proportion of university students with psychological problems is about 23%, which is slightly higher than the research results during the non-epidemic period. This paper suggests that college students should master methods of self-regulation, improve their levels of physical exercise, improve their physical fitness, and establish and improve their defense mechanisms to alleviate psychological conflicts and pressures.",0.9994656443595886

Using baseline data from a randomized, phase 3 study of 130 Japanese patients with rosacea treated with metronidazole gel (0.75%) or vehicle, the authors evaluated demographic and clinical characteristics, pretreatment quality of life, and exacerbating factors. In line with global data, most patients were women (82.3%; 107/130) and aged between 30 and 50 years (60.7%; 79/130). Patient-reported quality of life scores indicated that rosacea had an impact similar to that of other debilitating and disfiguring skin conditions (such as psoriasis), particularly in terms of the emotional burden. Anxiety or depression was reported by 30% of patients (39/130), with 6.9% (9/130) reporting moderate levels and 0.8% (1/130) reporting severe levels. The top five exacerbating factors reported to trigger worsening of rosacea were temperature changes, sun exposure, hot weather, seasonal variation, and heavy exercise. In addition, pollen exposure and menstruation were noted as triggers of rosacea symptoms; these are novel findings that require further investigation to fully understand the implications for patients and treatment. Rosacea is likely to be underdiagnosed and undertreated in Japan because of the current lack of consensus guidelines and standardized therapy. The authors anticipate that the results of this analysis will provide much needed information to help improve diagnosis and facilitate the management of rosacea in patients.",0.9973951578140259

Recently, a novel approach for delivering Zn via microbiologically treated, Zn-fortified water was shown to be effective in improving Zn status in West African schoolchildren. We assessed the effectiveness of Zn-fortified, microbiologically purified water delivered as a household intervention on Zn intake, status and morbidity in children aged 2-6 years from rural western Kenya. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Intervention included households assigned to water treatment device with (ZFW) or without (FW) Zn delivery capability SETTING: Rural households in Kisumu, western Kenya. Subjects: Children aged 2-6 years. Results: The ZFW group had higher dietary Zn intake compared with the FW group. ZFW contributed 36 and 31 % of daily requirements for absorbable Zn in children aged 2-3 and 4-6 years, respectively, in the ZFW group. Consumption of Zn-fortified water resulted in lower prevalence of reported illness (risk ratio; 95 % CI) in the ZFW group compared with the FW group: for cold with runny nose (0·91; 0·83, 0·99; P=0·034) and abdominal pain (0·70; 0·56, 0·89; P=0·003) in the intention-to-treat analysis and for diarrhoea (0·72; 0·53, 0·96; P=0·025) in the per-protocol analysis.

138,2021,27979773,Can zinc help treat the common cold?,zinc common cold,1.0,"Previous studies have suggested that oral zinc supplementation can help reduce the duration of the common cold; however, the use of intranasal (IN) zinc is strongly associated with anosmia, or the loss of the sense of smell, in humans. Prior studies from this lab showed that upregulation of metallothioneins (MT) is a rapid and robust response to zinc gluconate (ZG). Therefore, we assessed the role of MT in the recovery of nasal epithelial damage resulting from IN zinc administration. The main studies in this investigation used a high dose of ZG (170mM) to ensure ablation of the olfactory mucosa, so that the progression of histological and functional recovery could be assessed. In vivo studies using wild-type, MT1/2 knockout mice (MT KO), and heterozygotes administered ZG by IN instillation showed profound loss of the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity. Recovery was monitored, and a lower percentage of the MT KO mice were able to smell 28 d after treatment; however, no significant difference was observed in the rate of cell proliferation in the basal layer of the olfactory epithelium between MT KO and wild-type mice. A lower concentration of ZG (33mM), equivalent to that found in homeopathic IN ZG preparations, also caused olfactory epithelial toxicity in mice. These studies suggest that the use of zinc in drug formulations intended for IN administration in humans must be carefully evaluated for their potential to cause olfactory functional deficits.",0.9998611211776733

138,2021,12391710,Can zinc help treat the common cold?,zinc common cold,1.0,"Patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis may benefit from hydration and a diet low in sodium, omega-6 fatty acids, and transfatty acids, but high in omega-3 fatty acids (i.e., fish, almonds, walnuts, pumpkin, and flax seeds), onions, and fruits and vegetables (at least five servings a day). Physicians may need to be more cautious when prescribing antibiotics to children in their first year of life when they are born to families with a history of atopy. More research is needed to establish whether supplementation with probiotics (lactobacillus and bifidobacterium) during the first year of life or after antibiotic use decreases the risk of developing asthma and allergic rhinitis. Despite a theoretic basis for the use of vitamin C supplements in asthmatic patients, the evidence is still equivocal, and long-term studies are needed. The evidence is stronger for exercise-induced asthma, in which the use of vitamin C supplementation at a dosage of 1 to 2 g per day may be helpful. It is also possible that fish oil supplements, administered in a dosage of 1 to 1.2 g of EPA and DHA per day, also may be helpful to some patients with asthma. Long-term studies of fish oil and vitamin C are needed for more definite answers. For the patient interested in incorporating nutritional approaches, vitamin C and fish oils have a safe profile. However, aspirin-sensitive individuals should avoid fish oils, and red blood cell magnesium levels may help in making the decision whether to use additional magnesium supplements. Combination herbal formulas should be used in the treatment of asthma with medical supervision and in collaboration with an experienced herbalist or practitioner of TCM. Safe herbs, such as Boswellia and gingko, may be used singly as adjuncts to a comprehensive plan of care if the patient and practitioner have an interest in trying them while staying alert for drug-herb interactions. No data on the long-term use of these single herbs in asthma exist. For the motivated patient, mind-body interventions such as yoga, hypnosis, and biofeedback-assisted relaxation and breathing exercises are beneficial for stress reduction in general and may be helpful in further controlling asthma. Encouraging parents to learn how to massage their asthmatic children may appeal to some parents and provide benefits for parents and children alike. Acupuncture and chiropractic treatment cannot be recommended at this time, although some patients may derive benefit because of the placebo effect. For patients with allergic rhinitis, there are no good clinical research data on the use of quercetin and vitamin C. Similarly, freeze-dried stinging nettle leaves may be tried, but the applicable research evidence also is poor. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of these supplements and herbs. Homeopathic remedies based on extreme dilutions of the allergen may be beneficial in allergic rhinitis but require collaboration with an experienced homeopath. There are no research data on constitutional homeopathic approaches to asthma and allergic rhinitis. Patients with COPD are helped by exercise, pulmonary rehabilitation, and increased caloric protein and fat intake. Vitamin C and n-3 supplements are safe and reasonable; however, studies are needed to establish their efficacy in COPD. On the other hand, there are convincing data in favor of N-acetyl-cysteine supplementation for the patient with COPD at doses ranging between 400 and 1200 mg daily. Red blood cell magnesium levels may guide the use of magnesium replacement. The use of L-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 in patients with COPD needs further study. The addition of essential oils to the dietary regimen of patients with chronic bronchitis is worth exploring. Patients with upper respiratory tract infections can expect a shorter duration of symptoms by taking high doses of vitamin C (2 g) with zinc supplements, preferably the nasal zinc gel, at the onset of their symptoms. Adding an herb such as echinacea or Andrographis shortens the duration of the common cold. The one study on Elderberry's use for the flu was encouraging, and the data on the homeopathic remedy Oscillococcinum interesting, but more studies should be performed. Saline washes may be helpful to patients with allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis. Patients also may try the German combination (available in the United States) of elderberry, vervain, gentian, primrose, and sorrel that has been tested in randomized clinical trials. Bromelain is safe to try; the trials of bromelain supplementation were promising but were never repeated. The preceding suggestions need to be grounded in a program based on optimal medical management. Patients need to be well educated in the proper medical management of their disease and skilled at monitoring disease stability and progress. Asthmatic patients need to monitor their bronchodilator usage and peak flow meter measurements to step up their medical treatment in a timely manner, if needed. Patients welcome physician guidance when exploring the breadth of treatments available today. A true patient-physician partnership is always empowering to patients who are serious about regaining their function and health.",0.11294649541378021

142,2021,33642554,Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,probiotics child diarrhea caused by antibiotics ,1.0,"Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a typical side effect of antibiotic treatment, especially in children. Amoxicillin (AMPC) and amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMPC/CVA) are associated with high risk of AAD; however, these antibiotics are important in the pediatric field. Recent research suggests that probiotics prevent pediatric AAD, including that caused by AMPC and AMPC/CVA. Indeed, guidelines for acute otitis media in children recommend the concomitant use of probiotics. However, the prescription status of probiotics for pediatric patients with otitis media receiving oral AMPC and AMPC/CVA remains unknown. We therefore conducted a survey to clarify the current status of these prescriptions and, in particular, to identify specific populations with a low proportion of probiotic prescriptions. Pediatric patients (≤15 years of age) newly prescribed oral AMPC or AMPC/CVA for otitis media between April 2016 and March 2017 were identified from a Japanese health insurance claims database. Eligible patients were divided into the AMPC (1303 patients) and AMPC/CVA (424 patients) groups, in which 659 (50.6%) and 293 (69.1%) patients were prescribed probiotics, respectively. Of the patients receiving probiotic prescriptions in the AMPC and AMPC/CVA groups, 632 (95.9%) and 286 (97.6%) patients received antibiotic-resistant probiotic prescriptions, respectively. When classified by the prescribing clinical department and patient age, the proportions of probiotic prescriptions in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics departments were lower than those in the Otorhinolaryngology department regardless of age. These results indicate the probability of insufficient probiotic prescriptions for pediatric patients with otitis media. Solving this issue may lead to the provision of safer antimicrobial therapy.",0.9998865127563477

This may result in complications, the most serious of which is Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD). Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the prevention of CDAD in adults and children receiving antibiotics. Data sources: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Web of Science, and 12 gray-literature sources. Study selection: Randomized, controlled trials including adult or pediatric patients receiving antibiotics that compared any strain or dose of a specified probiotic with placebo or with no treatment control and reported the incidence of CDAD. Data extraction: Two reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles; extracted data on populations, interventions, and outcomes; and assessed risk of bias. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines were used to independently rate overall confidence in effect estimates for each outcome. Data synthesis: Twenty trials including 3818 participants met the eligibility criteria. Probiotics reduced the incidence of CDAD by 66% (pooled relative risk, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.49]; I(2) = 0%). In a population with a 5% incidence of antibiotic-associated CDAD (median control group risk), probiotic prophylaxis would prevent 33 episodes (CI, 25 to 38 episodes) per 1000 persons. Of probiotic-treated patients, 9.3% experienced adverse events, compared with 12.6% of control patients (relative risk, 0.82 [CI, 0.65 to 1.05]; I(2) = 17%). Limitations: In 13 trials, data on CDAD were missing for 5% to 45% of patients. The results were robust to worst-plausible assumptions regarding event rates in studies with missing outcome data. Conclusion: Moderate-quality evidence suggests that probiotic prophylaxis results in a large reduction in CDAD without an increase in clinically important adverse events.

Hospitalized patients with AAD are at increased risk for nosocomial infections and have a higher mortality. Probiotics are living microorganisms used to restore gut health by changing the intestinal microbiota. Several have been studied for the prevention of AAD. Five meta-analyses of trials of probiotics for the prevention of AAD have been performed. The results showed an overall reduction in the risk of AAD when probiotics were coadministered with antibiotics. McFarland conducted the largest meta-analysis to date analyzing 25 randomized controlled trials of probiotics for the prevention of AAD including 2810 subjects. More than half of the trials demonstrated efficacy of the probiotic. In particular, Lactobacillus GG, Saccharomyces boulardii, and the probiotic mixtures were effective. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published a review of the literature on the use of probiotics for the prevention of pediatric AAD, including 10 randomized trials testing 1986 children. The per protocol pooled analysis, but not the intent-to-treat analysis, showed that probiotics are effective for preventing AAD with the number needed to treat to prevent 1 case of diarrhea being 10. Lactobacillus GG, Bacillus coagulans, and S. boulardii appeared to be most effective. Probiotics are generally safe, however, they should be used with caution in patients who have compromise of either the immune system or the integrity of the intestinal mucosa, and in the presence of a central venous catheter.",0.9998635053634644
142,2021,7671647,Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,probiotics child diarrhea caused by antibiotics ,1.0,"Diarrhea represents a major health problem for travelers to developing countries. Although the syndrome is usually self-limited and recovery occurs in the majority of cases without any specific form of therapy, there is a need for safe and effective ways of preventing and treating it. Since the syndrome is most often caused by an infection acquired by ingesting fecally contaminated food or beverages, precautions regarding dietary habits remain the cornerstone of prophylaxis, but dietary self-restrictions do not always translate to reduced rates of diarrheal illness. Administration of probiotics (e.g. lactobacilli or Saccharomyces boulardii) and immunoprophylaxis with the newer oral cholera vaccines have been tried with promising results. Antimicrobials remain, however, the most successful form of prophylaxis, being effective in up to 90% of travelers. For those with impaired health who will take prophylaxis, systemic agents with proved efficacy should be recommended. For other otherwise healthy persons, poorly absorbed agents are preferable in order to avoid the serious, albeit rare, toxicity of systemic drugs. The key factor in the management of acute watery traveler's diarrhea, particularly in infants and young children, is the restoration of water and electrolyte balance. This does not reduce the duration of the illness but will limit dehydration and prevent acidosis. Many patients will require no additional therapy, whereas some will need pharmacologic treatment to shorten the duration of diarrhea or to relieve the accompanying symptoms, like abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting. A typical 3- to 5-day illness can be reduced to approximately 1 day by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) combination. Some other systemic antimicrobials have been successfully used but, during the last few years, the 4-fluoroquinolone drugs have received considerable attention and have been shown to be highly effective in reducing the duration of traveler's diarrhea. These antimicrobials may become the best option for adults. The safest choice remains the use of poorly absorbed antimicrobials. Unfortunately, however, only a few compounds (i.e. bicozamycin and furazolidone) have been specifically tested in the therapy of traveler's diarrhea. Others (e.g. nifuroxazide or rifaximin), which have been found effective in various homeland forms of infective diarrhea deserve to be evaluated in specifically designed clinical trials. Persons visiting developing countries where the risk of traveler's diarrhea is high should be recommended to bring an antidiarrheal compound or bismuth subsalycilate, if available, and an antibacterial agent. For infants, children and the elderly, in whom dehydration may occur rapidly and be particularly dangerous, oral rehydration solutions are indicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0.008431486785411835
143,2021,34961547,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Background: The global burden of osteoarthritis (OA) is steadily increasing due to demographic and lifestyle changes. The nervous system can undergo peripheral and central neuroplastic changes (sensitization) in patients with OA impacting the options to manage the pain adequately. As a result of sensitization, patients with OA show lower pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), facilitated temporal summation of pain (TSP), and impaired conditioned pain modulation (CPM). As traditional analgesics (acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are not recommended for long-term use in OA, more fundamental knowledge related to other possible management regimes are needed. Duloxetine is a serotonin-noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor, and analgesic effects are documented in patients with OA although the underlying fundamental mechanisms remain unclear. The descending pain inhibitory control system is believed to be dependent on serotonin and noradrenalin. We hypothesized that the analgesic effect of duloxetine could act through these pathways and consequently indirectly reduce pain and sensitization. The aim of this mechanistic study is to investigate if PPTs, TSP, CPM, and clinical pain parameters are modulated by duloxetine. Methods: This proof of concept study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial, which compares PPTs, TSP, and CPM before and after 18 weeks of duloxetine and placebo in forty patients with knee OA. The intervention periods include a titration period (2 weeks), treatment period (60 mg daily for 14 weeks), and a discontinuation period (2 weeks). Intervention periods are separated by 2 weeks. Discussion: Duloxetine is recommended for the treatment of chronic pain, but the underlying mechanisms of the analgesic effects are currently unknown. This study will investigate if duloxetine can modify central pain mechanisms and thereby provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of the analgesic effect.

143,2021,33541559,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Purpose: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a frequently occurring, chronic condition; however, few studies describe the clinical characteristics of individuals with OA and the treatments they use to manage their symptoms. We conducted a study to characterize the OA population in the US and describe the nonsurgical management used by this population based on consumer research data collected through an online survey. Methods: Data from the 2017 US National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS) for adults aged ≥35 years were used to evaluate the relationship between OA and certain study participant characteristics and to identify the most commonly used treatment options. NHWS data were collected through a survey of individuals drawn from the internet panel maintained by Lightspeed Research (Bridgewater, New Jersey) and its panel partners. Weighted estimates were generated using data from the 2016 Current Population Survey (Annual Demographics File) of the US Census Bureau. Comparisons between the general and OA populations were made based on body mass index (BMI), exercise frequency, and comorbid diagnoses of hypertension or diabetes. Among the OA population, the use of dietary supplements, prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) treatments with chondroitin with or without glucosamine (Ch ± Gl), prescription treatment by time since OA diagnosis, and utilization of a physical therapist were also recorded. Results: The prevalence of OA in the overall population was 17.6 % and was higher for individuals with a BMI ≥ 25 (21.9 %), patients diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes (36.2 %), and those who did not exercise regularly (19.0 %). Adults without OA were more likely to exercise regularly (12 days per month or more) than adults diagnosed with OA. Ch ± Gl (6.0 %) was the most commonly used OTC dietary supplement in the OA population, followed by omega-3 fatty acids (2.8 %), vitamin D (1.9 %), calcium (1.1 %), and multivitamins (0.7 %). Individuals using Ch ± Gl were more likely to use OTC only products (75.4 % vs 37.3 %) or prescription medications, namely non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or opioids, and OTC products (24.6 % vs 13.0 %) compared with individuals not using Ch ± Gl, while individuals not using Ch ± Gl were more likely to be untreated (30.3 % vs 0) or to use prescription medications only (19.4 % vs 0). Nearly 32 % of individuals with OA reported using prescription treatments, and the likelihood of using a prescription treatment increased with number of years since OA diagnosis ( 3 years: 27.5 %; ≥21 years: 32.5 %). The pharmaceutical products used by this population primarily consisted of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen and opioids. Approximately 13 % of patients with OA had visited a physical therapist in the past 6 months. Conclusions: The prevalence of OA was higher in those with a high BMI, and comorbid diabetes or hypertension. Individuals with OA using Ch ± Gl primarily reported use of OTC products only or used them in combination with prescription products. The likelihood of using prescription products increased with the length of OA history. These data provide valuable new information about demographics, clinical characteristics, and commonly used prescription and OTC treatments and dietary supplements in the OA population.",0.9997215867042542
143,2021,33428370,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Chronic pain and opioid use and abuse is a significant problem in the United States and in Florida. Over one-quarter of United States citizens suffer from chronic pain. It is among the most common complaints seen in an outpatient clinic and the emergency department. The failure to manage chronic pain, as well as the possible complication of opioid dependence related to treatment, can result in significant morbidity and mortality. One in five patient complaints in an outpatient clinic is related to pain, with over half of all patients seeing their primary care provider for one pain complaint or another. It is paramount that providers have a firm grasp on the management of patients with chronic pain. As a country, the United States spends well over 100 billion dollars a year on healthcare costs related to pain management and opioid dependence. Pain-related expenses exceed those for the costs of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease combined. How a patient's chronic pain gets managed can have profound and long-lasting effects on a patient's quality of life. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain lasting longer than three months. There are multiple sources of chronic pain. Combination therapy for pain includes both pharmacological therapies and nonpharmacological treatment options. There is a more significant reduction in pain with combination therapy compared to a single treatment alone. Escalation of pharmacological therapy is in a stepwise approach. Comorbid depression and anxiety are widespread in patients with chronic pain. Patients with chronic pain are also at increased risk for suicide. Chronic pain can impact every facet of a patient's life. Thus learning to diagnose and appropriately manage patients experiencing chronic pain is critical. Unfortunately, studies have revealed an inherent lack of education regarding pain management in most professional schools and training programs. Many schools have committed to opioid-related education and training by incorporating the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain into the medical school curriculum. Appropriate opioid prescribing includes prescribing sufficient opioid medication through regular assessment, treatment planning, and monitoring to provide effective pain control while avoiding addiction, abuse, overdose, diversion, and misuse. To be successful, clinicians must understand appropriate opioid prescribing, assessment, the potential for abuse and addiction, and potential psychological problems. Inappropriate opioid prescribing typically involves not prescribing, under prescribing, overprescribing, or continuing to prescribe opioids when they are no longer effective. The American Society of Addiction Medicine describes addiction as a treatable chronic disease that involves environmental pressures, genetics, an individual's life experiences, and interactions among brain circuits. Individuals that become addicted to opioids or other medications often engage in behaviors that become compulsive and result in dangerous consequences. The American Society of Addiction Medicines notes that while the following should not be used as diagnostic criteria due to variability among addicted individuals, they identify five characteristics of addiction: <ol style=""list-style-type:decimal"" xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:p1=""http://pubmed.gov/pub-one"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><li> Craving for drug or positive reward </li><li> Dysfunctional emotional response </li><li> Failure to recognize significant problems affecting behavior and relationships </li><li> Inability to consistently abstain </li><li> Impairment in control of behavior </li></ol> Craving for drug or positive reward Dysfunctional emotional response Failure to recognize significant problems affecting behavior and relationships Inability to consistently abstain Impairment in control of behavior Unfortunately, for most health providers, understanding of addiction is often confusing, inaccurate, and inconsistent due to the broad range of perspectives of those dealing with patients suffering from addiction. While a knowledge gap is present among healthcare providers, it is equally prevalent in politicians writing laws and law enforcement attempting to enforce the laws they write. Payers are responsible for the expenses associated with the evaluation and treatment of addiction. Persistent lack of education and the use of obsolete terminology continue to contribute to a societal lack of understanding for effectively dealing with the challenges of addiction. In the past, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defined ""addiction,"" ""substance abuse,"" and ""substance dependence"" separately. The result was provider confusion contributed to the under-treatment of pain. Over time, the manual has eliminated these terms and now uses ""substance use disorder,"" ranging from mild to severe. Unfortunately, there are numerous challenges in pain management, such as both underprescribing and overprescribing opioids. The concerns are particularly prominent in patients with chronic pain and have resulted in patients suffering from inadequately treated pain while at the same time there has been a development of concomitant opioid abuse, addiction, diversion, and overdose. As a result, providers are often negatively influenced and fail to deliver appropriate, effective, and safe opioids to patients with chronic pain. Providers have, in the past, been poorly trained and ill-informed in their opioid prescribing. To make the challenges even worse, chronic pain patients often develop opioid tolerance, significant psychological, behavioral, and emotional problems, including anxiety and depression related to under or overprescribing opioids. Clinicians who prescribe opioids face challenges that involve medical negligence in either failure to provide adequate pain control or risk of licensure or even criminal charges if it is perceived they are involved in drug diversion or misuse. All providers that prescribe opioids need additional education and training to provide the best patient outcomes and avoid the social and legal entanglements associated with over and under prescribing opioids.

Misuse of Controlled Substances Unfortunately, the misuse of controlled substances resulting in morbidity and mortality is rampant. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health,2016, performed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, over 10 million people misuse prescription pain medications, and over 2 million misuse sedatives, stimulants, and tranquilizers each year. The same study found that the most common reason for misuse is for the treatment of physical pain. The Center for Disease Control estimates more than 40,000 people die each year die from an opioid overdose. Controlled Substances There are three common classes of controlled substances commonly misused: opioids, depressants, and stimulants. Opioids Opioids are prescribed for pain control by binding to mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system reducing pain signals to the brain as well as receptors in the GI tract and respiratory system, and are used to treat pain, diarrhea, and cough. Common Opioids Codeine - One of the most commonly taken opioid medications. It is at the center of the opioid addiction problem in the United States and thus is highly regulated. Its main indication is for pain and cough. FDA-Approved Indication Pain Codeine plays a role in the treatment of mild to moderate pain. Its use is recognized in chronic pain due to ongoing cancer and palliative care. However, the use of codeine to treat other types of chronic pain remains controversial. Chronic pain, defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain, is pain persisting beyond the standard tissue healing time, which is three months.[1] The most prevalent causes of non-cancer chronic pain include back pain, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and headache. Non-FDA Approved Indications Cough Codeine is useful in the treatment of various etiologies producing chronic cough. Also, 46% of patients with chronic cough do not have a distinct etiology despite a proper diagnostic evaluation. Codeine produces a decrease in cough frequency and severity in these patients. However, there is limited literature demonstrating the efficacy of codeine in chronic cough. The dose can vary from 15 mg to 120 mg a day. It is, however, indicated in the management of prolonged cough (in specific populations like lung cancer) usually as 30 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed. Restless Leg Syndrome Codeine is effective in treating restless leg syndrome when given at night time, especially for those whose symptoms are not relieved by other medications. Persistent Diarrhea (Palliative) Codeine and loperamide are equally effective, and the choice between them has its basis in the assessment of the physician evaluating the small but undoubted addictive potential of codeine versus the higher cost of loperamide, and an individual difference in patient's vulnerability to adverse effects. Fentanyl - Transdermal patch and IV, commonly abused and used in mixture with other drugs. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 80-100 times stronger than morphine and is often added to heroin to increase its potency. It can cause severe respiratory depression and death, particularly mixed when mixed with other drugs or alcohol. It has a high addiction potential. Hydrocodone - Hydrocodone is a schedule II semi-synthetic opioid medication used to treat pain. Immediate-release (IR) hydrocodone is available as a combination product (combined with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, etc.) and is FDA approved for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative (non-opioid) treatments are inadequate. Single-entity hydrocodone is only available in extended-release (ER) formulations. It is FDA approved to treat persistent pain severe enough to require 24-hour, long-term opioid treatment, and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Hydrocodone is also an antitussive and indicated for cough in adults. Morphine Sulfate - FDA-approved usage of morphine sulfate includes moderate to severe pain that may be acute or chronic. Most commonly used in pain management, morphine provides significant relief to patients afflicted with pain. Clinical situations that benefit significantly by medicating with morphine include managing palliative/end-of-life care, active cancer treatment, and vaso-occlusive pain during sickle cell crisis. Morphine is widely used off-label for almost any condition that causes pain. In the emergency department, morphine is given for musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, arthritis, and even headaches when patients fail to respond to first and second-line agents. Morphine is rarely used for procedural sedation. However, clinicians will sometimes combine a low dose of morphine with a low dose of benzodiazepine-like lorazepam for small procedures. Oxycodone - An opioid agonist prescription medication. The oxycodone immediate-release formulation is FDA-approved for the management of acute or chronic moderate to severe pain for which other treatments do not suffice, and for which the use of opioid medication is appropriate. The extended-release formulation is FDA-approved for the management of pain severe enough to require continuous (24 hours per day), long-term opioid treatment, and for which there are no alternative options to treat the pain. The oxycodone to morphine dose equivalent ratio is approximately 1 to 1.5 for immediate-release and 1 to 2 for extended-release formulations. Tramadol - Tramadol is an FDA approved medication for pain relief. It has specific indications for moderate to severe pain. It is considered a class IV drug by the FDA. Due to possible abuse and addiction potential, limitations to its use should be for pain that is refractive to other pain medication, such as non-opioid pain medication. There are two forms of tramadol: extended-release and immediate release. The immediate-release is not for use as an ""as needed"" medication; instead, it is for pain of less than a week duration. For pain lasting more than a week, extended-release is the therapeutic choice — the indication for extended-release is for pain control under 24-hour management or an extended period. Off-label, the drug is useful for premature ejaculation and restless leg syndrome refractory to other medications. For the off-label use of tramadol for premature ejaculation, both sporadic and daily use is effective for the treatment of the condition. Patients indicate a preference for ""as needed"" therapy for premature ejaculation due to the lack of side effects compared to the daily use of tramadol. Addiction, Dependence, and Tolerance While each of these terms is similar, providers should be aware of the differences. <ol style=""list-style-type:disc"" xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:p1=""http://pubmed.gov/pub-one"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><li> Addiction - the constant need for a drug despite harmful consequences. </li><li> Pseudoaddiction - constant fear of being in pain, hypervigilance; usually, there is a resolution with pain resolution. </li><li> Dependence - physical adaptation to a medication where it is necessary for normal function and withdrawal occurs with lack of the medication. </li><li> Tolerance - lack of expected response to a medication increasing dose to achieve the same pain relief resulting from CNS adaptation to the medication over time. </li></ol> Addiction - the constant need for a drug despite harmful consequences.

Inappropriate opioid prescribing typically involves not prescribing, under prescribing, overprescribing, or continuing to prescribe opioids when they are no longer effective. The American Society of Addiction Medicine describes addiction as a treatable chronic disease that involves environmental pressures, genetics, an individual's life experiences, and interactions among brain circuits. Individuals that become addicted to opioids or other medications often engage in behaviors that become compulsive and result in dangerous consequences. The American Society of Addiction Medicines notes that while the following should not be used as diagnostic criteria due to variability among addicted individuals, they identify five characteristics of addiction: <ol style=""list-style-type:decimal"" xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:p1=""http://pubmed.gov/pub-one"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><li> Craving for drug or positive reward </li><li> Dysfunctional emotional response </li><li> Failure to recognize significant problems affecting behavior and relationships </li><li> Inability to consistently abstain </li><li> Impairment in control of behavior </li></ol> Craving for drug or positive reward Dysfunctional emotional response Failure to recognize significant problems affecting behavior and relationships Inability to consistently abstain Impairment in control of behavior Unfortunately, for most health providers, understanding of addiction is often confusing, inaccurate, and inconsistent due to the broad range of perspectives of those dealing with patients suffering from addiction. While a knowledge gap is present among healthcare providers, it is equally prevalent in politicians writing laws and law enforcement attempting to enforce the laws they write. Payers are responsible for the expenses associated with the evaluation and treatment of addiction. Persistent lack of education and the use of obsolete terminology continue to contribute to a societal lack of understanding for effectively dealing with the challenges of addiction. In the past, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defined ""addiction,"" ""substance abuse,"" and ""substance dependence"" separately. The result was provider confusion contributed to the under-treatment of pain. Over time, the manual has eliminated these terms and now uses ""substance use disorder,"" ranging from mild to severe. Unfortunately, there are numerous challenges in pain management, such as both underprescribing and overprescribing opioids. The concerns are particularly prominent in patients with chronic pain and have resulted in patients suffering from inadequately treated pain while at the same time there has been a development of concomitant opioid abuse, addiction, diversion, and overdose. As a result, providers are often negatively influenced and fail to deliver appropriate, effective, and safe opioids to patients with chronic pain. Providers have, in the past, been poorly trained and ill-informed in their opioid prescribing. To make the challenges even worse, chronic pain patients often develop opioid tolerance, significant psychological, behavioral, and emotional problems, including anxiety and depression related to under or overprescribing opioids. Clinicians that prescribe opioids face challenges that involve medical negligence in either failure to provide adequate pain control or risk of licensure or even criminal charges if it is perceived they are involved in drug diversion or misuse. All providers that prescribe opioids need additional education and training to provide the best patient outcomes and avoid the social and legal entanglements associated with over and under prescribing opioids. Provider Opioid Knowledge Deficit There are substantial knowledge gaps around appropriate and inappropriate opioid prescribing, including deficits in understanding current research, legislation, and appropriate prescribing practices. Providers often have knowledge deficits that include: <ol style=""list-style-type:disc"" xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:p1=""http://pubmed.gov/pub-one"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><li> Understanding of addiction </li><li> At-risk opioid addiction populations </li><li> Prescription vs. non-prescription opioid addiction </li><li> The belief that addiction and dependence on opioids is synonymous </li><li> The belief that opioid addiction is a psychologic problem instead related to a chronic painful disease </li></ol> Understanding of addiction At-risk opioid addiction populations Prescription vs. non-prescription opioid addiction The belief that addiction and dependence on opioids is synonymous The belief that opioid addiction is a psychologic problem instead related to a chronic painful disease With a long history of misunderstanding, poor society, provider education, and inconsistent laws, the prescription of opioids has resulted in significant societal challenges that will only resolve with significant education and training. Misuse of Controlled Substances Unfortunately, the misuse of controlled substances resulting in morbidity and mortality is rampant. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2016, performed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over 10 million people misuse prescription pain medications, and over 2 million misuse sedatives, stimulants, and tranquilizers each year. The same study found that the most common reason for misuse is for the treatment of physical pain. The Center for Disease Control estimates more than 40,000 people die each year die from an opioid overdose. Controlled Substances There are three common classes of controlled substances that are commonly misused: opioids, depressants, and stimulants. Opioids Opioids are prescribed for pain control by binding to mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system reducing pain signals to the brain as well as receptors in the GI tract and respiratory system and are used to treat pain, diarrhea, and cough. Common Opioids Codeine - One of the most commonly taken opioid medications. It is at the center of the opioid addiction problem in the United States and thus is highly regulated. Its main indication is for pain and cough. FDA-Approved Indication Pain Codeine plays a role in the treatment of mild to moderate pain. Its use is recognized in chronic pain due to ongoing cancer and palliative care. However, the use of codeine to treat other types of chronic pain remains controversial. Chronic pain, defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain, is pain persisting beyond the standard tissue healing time, which is three months.[1] The most prevalent causes of non-cancer chronic pain include back pain, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and headache. Non-FDA Approved Indications Cough Codeine is useful in the treatment of various etiologies producing chronic cough. Also, 46% of patients with chronic cough do not have a distinct etiology despite a proper diagnostic evaluation. Codeine produces a decrease in cough frequency and severity in these patients. However, there is limited literature demonstrating the efficacy of codeine in chronic cough. The dose can vary from 15 mg to 120 mg a day. It is, however, indicated in the management of prolonged cough (in specific populations like lung cancer) usually as 30 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed. Restless Leg Syndrome Codeine is effective in the treatment of restless leg syndrome when given at night time, especially for those whose symptoms are not relieved by other medications. Persistent Diarrhea (Palliative) Codeine and loperamide are equally effective, and the choice between them has its basis in the assessment of the physician evaluating the small but undoubted addictive potential of codeine versus the higher cost of loperamide, and an individual difference in patient's vulnerability to adverse effects. Fentanyl - Transdermal patch and IV, commonly abused and used in mixture with other drugs. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 80-100 times stronger than morphine and is often added to heroin to increase its potency. It can cause severe respiratory depression and death, particularly mixed when mixed with other drugs or alcohol. It has high addiction potential. Hydrocodone - Hydrocodone is a schedule II semi-synthetic opioid medication used to treat pain. Immediate-release (IR) hydrocodone is available as a combination product (combined with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, etc.) and is FDA approved for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative (non-opioid) treatments are inadequate. Single-entity hydrocodone is only available in extended-release (ER) formulations. It is FDA approved to treat persistent pain severe enough to require 24-hour, long-term opioid treatment, and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Hydrocodone is also an antitussive and indicated for cough in adults. Morphine Sulfate - FDA-approved usage of morphine sulfate includes moderate to severe pain that may be acute or chronic. Most commonly used in pain management, morphine provides significant relief to patients afflicted with pain. Clinical situations that benefit significantly by medicating with morphine include management of palliative/end-of-life care, active cancer treatment, and vaso-occlusive pain during sickle cell crisis. Morphine is widely used off-label for almost any condition that causes pain. In the emergency department, morphine is given for musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, arthritis, and even headaches when patients fail to respond to first and second-line agents. Morphine is rarely used for procedural sedation. However, for small procedures, clinicians will sometimes combine a low dose of morphine with a low dose of benzodiazepine-like lorazepam. Oxycodone - An opioid agonist prescription medication. The oxycodone immediate-release formulation is FDA-approved for the management of acute or chronic moderate to severe pain for which other treatments do not suffice, and for which the use of opioid medication is appropriate. The extended-release formulation is FDA-approved for the management of pain severe enough to require continuous (24 hours per day), long-term opioid treatment, and for which there are no alternative options to treat the pain. The oxycodone to morphine dose equivalent ratio is approximately 1 to 1.5 for immediate-release and 1 to 2 for extended-release formulations. Tramadol - Tramadol is an FDA approved medication for pain relief. It has specific indications for moderate to severe pain. It is considered a class IV drug by the FDA. Due to possible abuse and addiction potential, limitations to its use should be for pain that is refractive to other pain medication, such as non-opioid pain medication. There are two forms of tramadol: extended-release and immediate release. The immediate-release is not for use as an ""as needed"" medication; instead, it is for pain of less than a week duration. For pain lasting more than a week, extended-release is the therapeutic choice — the indication for extended-release is for pain control under 24-hour management or an extended period. Off-label, the drug is useful for premature ejaculation and restless leg syndrome refractory to other medications. For the off-label use of tramadol for premature ejaculation, both sporadic and daily use is effective for the treatment of the condition. Patients indicate a preference for ""as needed"" therapy for premature ejaculation due to the lack of side effects compared to the daily use of tramadol. Addiction, Dependence, and Tolerance While each of these terms is similar, providers should be aware of the differences. <ol style=""list-style-type:disc"" xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:p1=""http://pubmed.gov/pub-one"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><li> Addiction - the constant need for a drug despite harmful consequences. </li><li> Pseudoaddiction - constant fear of being in pain, hypervigilance; usually there is a resolution with pain resolution. </li><li> Dependence - physical adaptation to a medication where it is necessary for normal function and withdrawal occurs with lack of the medication. </li><li> Tolerance - lack of expected response to a medication resulting in an increase in dose to achieve the same pain relief as a result of CNS adaptation to the medication over time. </li></ol> Addiction - the constant need for a drug despite harmful consequences.

143,2021,26353874,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Objectives: National and international evidence-based guidelines for hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) recommend to start with non-surgical treatments, followed by surgical intervention if a patient does not respond sufficiently to non-surgical treatments, but there are indications that these are not optimally used. The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which all recommended non-surgical treatments were used by patients with hip or knee OA who receive(d) a total hip or knee replacement, as reported by patients and orthopaedic surgeons. Setting: We performed two cross-sectional internet-based surveys among patients and orthopaedic surgeons throughout the Netherlands. Participants: 195 OA patients either have undergone total knee arthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty no longer than 12 months ago or being on the waiting list for surgery with a confirmed date within 3 months and 482 orthopaedic surgeons were invited to participate. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The use of recommended non-surgical treatments including education about OA/treatment options, lifestyle advice, dietary therapy, physical therapy, acetaminophen, NSAIDs and glucocorticoid injections. Results: 174 OA patients (93%) and 172 orthopaedic surgeons (36%) completed the surveys. Most recommended non-surgical treatments were given to the majority of patients (eg, 80% education about OA, 73% physical therapy, 72% acetaminophen, 80% NSAIDs). However, only 6% of patients and 10% of orthopaedic surgeons reported using a combination of all recommended treatments. Dietary therapy was used least frequently. Only 11% of overweight and 30% of obese participants reported having received dietary therapy and 28% of orthopaedic surgeons reported to prescribe dietary therapy to overweight patients. Conclusions: While most recommended non-surgical treatments were used frequently as single therapy, the combination is used in only a small percentage of OA patients. Especially, use of dietary therapy may be improved to help patients manage their symptoms, and potentially delay the need for joint arthroplasty.",0.9992918968200684

We analysed data from a sample of community-dwelling persons aged 55 and older with hip or knee arthritis to examine social and medical factors associated with reported variation in OA drugs. A key finding is that drug types used by OA patients vary by age and gender, independent of disease, and medical and social context.

143,2021,21887488,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Inadequacies in health care practices have been reported despite existing guidelines to manage hip or knee osteoarthritis. To facilitate guideline implementation and improve utilization of non-surgical treatment options a care strategy should be developed. This study describes the development of an evidence-based, multidisciplinary, patient-centered, stepped care strategy. A national, multidisciplinary, steering group developed the strategy in three phases: (1) consensus among steering group members (first draft); (2) written consultation of 23 representatives of patient organizations and professional associations involved in osteoarthritis care (second draft); (3) consensus of the final draft after discussion in two rounds during a conference with representatives from the different disciplines. The final stepped care strategy presents, in three tiers, the optimal order for non-surgical treatment modalities. It recommends that more advanced options should only be considered if options listed in previous steps failed to produce satisfactory results. Hence, the first step treatment options can be offered to all patients but may also be provided through self care (education, life style advice, and acetaminophen). The second step (exercise therapy, dietary therapy, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and third step treatment options (multidisciplinary care, intra-articular injections, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) can be considered for people with persisting complaints. Trough a consensus procedure, we succeeded to develop a multidisciplinary, patient-centered, stepped care strategy based on national guidelines. This strategy provides a framework for health care providers and patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis to discuss the optimal timing of the various treatment options.",0.0017448696307837963
143,2021,19271029,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common arthritis affecting the aging population. This degenerative disease can cause significant pain and functional disability in affected individuals. Despite advances in the retardation of rheumatoid arthritis with disease-modifying agents, comparable oral agents have been relatively unavailable for OA. The mainstays of therapy continue to be acetaminophen and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications to manage symptoms. Unfortunately, these medications can precipitate severe adverse events in some patients or may be contraindicated, leaving few choices remaining to control pain and suffering. Glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate have been evaluated in many studies as agents to relieve pain, improve functional activity, and slow disease progression in OA especially of the hip and knee. Studies have reported conflicting results regarding improvement in the pain and disability associated with OA with the use of glucosamine and chondroitin as single agents; however, when improvement has been demonstrated, the formulation has primarily been glucosamine sulfate combined with chondroitin sulfate. Recently, as a result of information implicating the role of reactive oxygen species and oxidative cellular stress reactions on the onset of neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders, it has been theorized that medications that could control or alter these reactions might improve or prevent the onset of these conditions. Primorine is a combination of products thought to alter these biochemical oxidative byproducts. Based on current evidence, the use of a combination product of glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate seems to have the greatest potential as a therapeutic intervention for patients at increased risk from the adverse events of accepted current oral therapies. The use of primorine and its combination of products as an intervention in OA has theoretical advantages but its benefits are unproven. A new product, relamine, is a combination of these three formulations. While no studies have evaluated glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and primorine in a single product, it may be an option for those who wish to try an alternate therapy for OA, as there appears to be a low risk for serious adverse events.",0.9994818568229675

Two interventions, positive psychology and music therapeutic songwriting, have independently led to decreased depressive symptoms and an improved wellbeing in older people over 65 years old. (2) Methods: This article describes the development of a therapeutic songwriting program for people living with late-life depression. Knowledge from positive psychology and therapeutic songwriting was combined to maximize the potential benefits. (3) Results: The intervention program has ten weekly 45 min sessions that incorporate elements from positive psychology into therapeutic songwriting. Using a three-song approach encompassing ongoing musical practices, different positive psychology interventions were incorporated to support the experiences associated with a flourishing life. The intervention protocol for older people presented here is distinct from previous deficit-orientated approaches in that it shifts the focus to positive experiences, resources, and the individual's ability to decrease their own depressive symptoms and improve their wellbeing.

144,2021,33302192,Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,"Background: There is a growing prevalence of prolonged antidepressant use globally. Social group interventions may be an effective way to manage mild to moderate depression, especially with patients seeking to discontinue antidepressant use. This systematic review evaluates studies that used social group interventions to manage depression. Methods: Studies published up to June 2019 in nine bibliographic databases were identified using search terms related to depression, social interventions, and social participation. Formal therapies for depression (cognitive behaviour therapy, music therapy) were excluded as they have been reviewed elsewhere. Results: 24 studies met inclusion criteria; 14 RCTs, 6 non-randomised controlled trials and 4 pre-post evaluations. In total, 28 social group programs were evaluated, 10 arts-based groups, 13 exercise groups and 5 others. Programs ranged in 'dose' from 5 to 150 hours (M = 31 hours) across 4 to 75 weeks (M = 15 weeks) and produced effect sizes on depression in the small to very large range (Hedge's g = .18 to 3.19, M = 1.14). A regression analysis revealed no participant variables, study variables or intervention variables were related to effect size on depression. Limitations: Risks of bias were found, primarily in the non-randomised studies, which means the findings must be regarded as preliminary until replicated. Conclusion: These findings indicate that social group interventions are an effective way to manage mild to moderate depression symptoms in a variety of populations. This approach may also help to prevent relapse among patients tapering off antidepressant medication.",0.011691896244883537

Manifestations of dissociation, such as feelings of detachment from the environment, can cause considerable anxiety for patients. Nonpharmacologic interventions may help clinicians to manage associated anxiety and confusion due to dissociation following administration of esketamine nasal spray. We present the case of a 64-year-old woman with major depressive disorder who participated in a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of esketamine nasal spray in conjunction with an oral antidepressant for TRD. The patient received flexible doses of esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg) twice weekly for 4 weeks. On treatment day 1, the patient was administered 56 mg of esketamine nasal spray using two nasal spray devices (28 mg per device). Twenty minutes after the first esketamine nasal spray device was administered, the patient experienced a dissociative episode lasting 40 minutes that caused anxiety and confusion.

Music can help regulate emotions, and mobile phones provide constant access to it. The Music eScape mobile app teaches young people how to identify and manage emotions using music. Objective: This study aimed to examine the effects of using Music eScape on emotion regulation, distress, and well-being at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months. Moderators of outcomes and user ratings of app quality were also examined. Methods: A randomized controlled trial compared immediate versus 1-month delayed access to Music eScape in 169 young people (aged 16 to 25 years) with at least mild levels of mental distress (Kessler 10 score&gt;17). Results: No significant differences between immediate and delayed groups on emotion regulation, distress, or well-being were found at 1 month. Both groups achieved significant improvements in 5 of the 6 emotion regulation skills, mental distress, and well-being at 2, 3, and 6 months. Unhealthy music use moderated improvements on 3 emotion regulation skills. Users gave the app a high mean quality rating (mean 3.8 [SD 0.6]) out of 5. Conclusions: Music eScape has the potential to provide a highly accessible way of improving young people's emotion regulation skills, but further testing is required to determine its efficacy.

144,2021,30234118,Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,"Background: Living at home following a diagnosis of dementia can be difficult for both the person living with dementia (PwD) and their family caregivers (FCG). Active group music participation may provide an avenue for emotional release, offer psychosocial support to caregivers and stimulate meaningful interaction between caregivers and loved ones with dementia. Therapeutic music interventions also have the capacity to facilitate reminiscence and social engagement and can help to manage challenging symptoms associated with dementia, such as anxiety, apathy, and agitation. Method: This feasibility study examined the acceptability of a 20-week therapeutic group singing intervention (Remini-Sing) and quantitative research assessments for PwD/FCG dyads living in the community. Quantitative measures for the following outcomes were tested for sensitivity and acceptability: relationship quality (PwD and FCG); life satisfaction, caregiver satisfaction, flourishing, and depression for FCGs; and anxiety, apathy, agitation, and quality of life for PwD. Quantitative assessments were conducted before, during (midway) and after 20 weeks of participation in a therapeutic singing group attended by the PwD and FCG together. The Remini-Sing intervention incorporated vocal warm ups, singing familiar songs, learning new songs, and opportunities for social interaction. Qualitative interviews were conducted with all dyads that completed the intervention. Results: Twelve PWD/FCG dyads were recruited and enrolled in the study. High participation and retention rates indicated that the intervention was received favorably by participants. There were no statistically significant changes on measures from pre to post intervention. However, favorable baseline scores on relationship quality and wellbeing measures were sustained over the 20-week intervention. The testing of these measures for feasibility also revealed that some were too difficult for PwD and thus yielded questionable results, some were potentially less relevant, and there were likely floor and ceiling effects on several of the measures utilized. Conclusions: This study demonstrated good feasibility for a research protocol and therapeutic group singing intervention for community-dwelling PwD and their FCGs. Participant reflections and researcher observations yielded useful information guiding the selection of quantitative outcome measures for future research in this area.",0.9994565844535828
144,2021,28900859,Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,"The study empirically investigated the idea that Quranic verses (Surah Al-Rehman) can help manage depression. Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud (radiAllahu anhu) reported that the Prophet (salAllahu alayhi wasalam) said, ""Everything has an adornment, and the adornment of the Qur'an is Surah Al-Rehman."" Surah Al-Rehman is the most rhythmic surah of the Quran, so it was used for our experimental study. The idea of the study was drawn from the premise that music therapy helps reduce depression. The objective of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of Surah Al-Rehman for managing depression in Muslim women admitted for treatment of major depressive disorder in a psychiatry ward of a government hospital. It was hypothesized that women diagnosed with severe depression in the treatment group will have reduced level of depression as compared to control group at post-assessment level. It was further hypothesized that the amount of decrease in depression in treatment group at the post-assessment level will be greater as compared to the control group. A purposive sample of 12 female patients diagnosed with depression was randomly assigned to the treatment group (n = 6) and control group (n = 6). Assessment was done at pre- and post-level by using Beck Depression Inventory-II. Both groups did not significantly differ on pre-assessment depression scores. Twelve structured group sessions of 22 min, two times a day, were conducted for a period of 4 weeks with the groups. Treatment group was made to listen to Surah Al-Rehman recited by Qari Abdul Basit, and control group was exposed to music used for relaxation and treatment of depression. Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to find the within-group differences between pre- and post-assessment scores. Both groups had decreased level of depression at post-assessment level, so it was important to assess if there was any difference in level of decrease. Mann-Whitney U test for comparison of groups on level of decrease at the post-assessment level endorsed that treatment group had significantly greater decrease than control group on depression. Our study highlights the efficacy of Surah Al-Rehman as a remedy to reduce depression. The Holy Quran intones, ""This sacred book is 'shifa' for its followers."" Hence, we recommend that researchers should focus on finding remedies for other psychological and physical diseases from Quranic verses. An exploration of possible mechanism (such as activated cognitions or associated emotions while listening to Quran) through which effects of recitation are reached, can also be subject of investigation for forthcoming studies.",0.999796450138092

Objectives: The objective of this review is to determine the best available evidence on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological pain management in relieving chronic pain for children and adolescents. Search strategy: The search strategy aimed to find published studies, between 1956 and 2008 and limited to the English or Chinese languages. Reference lists of studies that met the inclusion criteria were searched for additional studies. Types of studies: This review included any systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental design that explored the effectiveness of non-pharmacological intervention for chronic pain in children and adolescents. Types of participants: Children and adolescents with cancer pain, Juvenile chronic arthritis, sickle cell disease, burn pain, chronic or recurrent abdominal pain, headache and aged 18 years old or less and suffering with pain for at least one month. Types of interventions: The review considered studies that examined non-pharmacological interventions in relieving chronic pain for children and adolescents that included heat wrap therapy, massage, chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (distraction &amp; guided imagery), meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, self-hypnosis, biofeedback, music therapy, and dance training. Types of outcome measures: The primary outcome measures included: (1) Behavioral variables, such as pain behavior, cognitive coping and appraisal, psychiatric reaction (anxiety and depression), and social activities, (2) Quality of life scores and (3) Pain scores. Types of setting: The review focuses on studies that operated either at a hospital or in a community setting. Data collection and analysis: Meta-analysis was used to pool the data from studies to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. The Comprehensive Meta Analysis V2 was used to manage the data. Results: The search process identified 43,100 studies that addressed the objectives of the review protocol. Fifty-four articles were selected for critical appraisal. Finally, 31 trials were considered to be eligible for the present review and 5 articles were excluded. Data was pooled together from eight articles using meta-analysis to examine the effectiveness of relaxation training of the pre-test and post-test of headache intensity. The findings show that the effective size was 0.323 with significant difference. Two of the articles evaluate the effectiveness of relaxation training for releasing the recurrent headaches for adolescents and the post-test data were collected over the following six months. The findings show that there is a statistically significance difference. Another two articles examined the effectiveness of a relaxation training program in reducing the sum of medication used of adolescents with recurrent headaches. The findings show that there is no statistical significance. Furthermore, the findings show that biofeedback treatment could improve the outcome of children and adolescents' headache, especially at 6 and 12 months after the treatment. In terms of psychosocial treatment, five articles examined the effectiveness of behavioral treatment, relaxation training program, cognitive behavior therapy, and acupuncture/ hypnosis intervention to reduce anxiety of children and adolescent with chronic pain. The various outcomes measures among the five studies. Conclusions: This review has provided an evidence-based guide to future priorities for clinical practice. Relaxation programs could reduce recurrent headache and pain intensity in children and adolescents in the short term as well as lasting for three and six months. Furthermore, biofeedback treatment could reduce recurrent headache of pain intensity in children and adolescents in the short term and last for as long as six months.",0.998782217502594
144,2021,18646087,Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,"Background: With increasing survival estimates for cystic fibrosis (CF) long-term management has become an important focus. Psychological interventions are largely concerned with adherence to treatment, emotional and social adjustments and quality of life. We are unaware of any relevant systematic reviews. Objectives: Assess whether psychological interventions for CF provide significant psychosocial and physical benefits in addition to standard care. Search strategy: Trials were identified from two Cochrane trial registers (CF and Genetic Disorders Group; Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group), Ovid MEDLINE and PsychINFO; unpublished trials were located through professional networks and Listserves. Most recent search: September 2007. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of a broad range of psychological interventions in children and adults with CF and their immediate family. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected relevant trials and assessed their methodological quality. Main results: The review includes 13 studies (five new at this update) representing data from 529 participants. Studies mainly assessed behavioural and educational interventions:1. gene pre-test education counselling for relatives of those with CF;2. biofeedback, massage and music therapy to assist physiotherapy;3. behavioural and educational interventions to improve dietary intake and airway clearance;4. self-administration of medication and education to promote independence, knowledge and quality of life; and5. systemic interventions promoting psychosocial functioning.A substantial proportion of outcomes were educational or behavioural relating to issues of adherence, change in physical status or other specific treatment concerns during the chronic phase of the disease. Some evidence was found for relative's acceptance of a genetic test for carrier status when using home-based rather than clinic-based information leaflets and testing. There is some evidence that behavioural interventions improve emotional outcomes in people with CF and their carers, and that psychoeducational interventions improve knowledge in the short term. There was no consistent effect on lung function, although one small study showed that biofeedback-assisted breathing re-training helped improve some lung function measurements. Some studies point to educational and behavioural interventions aiding nutrition and growth in people with CF. Currently there is insufficient evidence for interventions aimed at other aspects of the disease process. Authors' conclusions: Currently no clear evidence exists on the best psychological interventions to help people with CF and their carers manage the disease. Trials of interventions to improve adherence to treatment are needed. Multicentre approaches, with consequent funding implications, will increase the sample size of trials and enhance the power and precision of their findings.",0.9992573857307434

Method: The authors conducted an 8-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of E-EPA in 30 female subjects meeting Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder. Results: Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to 1 g of E-EPA; 10 subjects were given placebo. Ninety percent of those in both groups completed all 8 weeks of the trial. Analyses that used random-effects regression modeling and controlled for baseline severity showed E-EPA to be superior to placebo in diminishing aggression as well as the severity of depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that E-EPA may be a safe and effective form of monotherapy for women with moderately severe borderline personality disorder.",0.9998797178268433

Objective: To determine whether high-dose vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves offspring neurodevelopment from birth to age 6 years. Design, setting, and participants: This prespecified secondary analysis of a double-blinded, placebo-controlled RCT of high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation vs standard dose during the third trimester of pregnancy was conducted in the unselected prospective mother-child birth cohort at a single-center research unit in Denmark as part of the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC-2010). Participants included pregnant women; women with vitamin D intake greater than 600 IU/d or an endocrine, heart, or kidney disorder, and those who did not speak Danish fluently were excluded. Neurodevelopmental assessments for offspring of these women were performed at ages 0 to 6 years. Children born prematurely (gestational week 37), with low birth weight ( 2500 g), or with a neurological disease affecting neurodevelopment were excluded. Data were analyzed from August 2019 to February 2020. Interventions: High-dose (ie, 2800 IU/d) vs standard dose (ie, 400 IU/d) vitamin D3 supplementation from pregnancy week 24 until 1 week after birth. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome of interest was cognitive development assessed at 2.5 years using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. Other neurodevelopmental outcomes included age of motor milestone achievement (Denver Developmental Index and World Health Organization milestone registration), language development (MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories), general neurodevelopment at age 3 years (Ages and Stages Questionnaire), and emotional and behavioral problems at age 6 years (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Results: Among 623 women randomized, 315 were randomized to high-dose vitamin D3 and 308 were randomized to standard dose placebo. A total of 551 children were evaluated from birth to age 6 years, (282 [51.2%] boys; 528 [95.8%] White), with 277 children in the high-dose vitamin D3 group and 274 children in the standard dose group. There was no effect of the high-dose compared with standard dose of vitamin D3 supplementation during pregnancy on offspring achievement of motor milestones (β = 0.08 [95% CI, -0.26 to 0.43]; P = .64), cognitive development (score difference: 0.34 [95% CI, -1.32 to 1.99]; P = .70), general neurodevelopment (median [IQR] communication score: 50 [50-55] vs 50 [50-55]; P = .62), or emotional and behavioral problems (odds ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.53 to 1.09]; P = .14). There was no effect on language development expressed by the word production at 1 year (median [IQR], 2 [0-6] words vs 3 [1-6] words; P = .16), although a decreased word production was apparent at 2 years in children in the high-dose vitamin D3 group (median [IQR], 232 [113-346] words vs 253 [149-382.5] words; P = .02). Conclusions and relevance: In this prespecified secondary analysis of an RCT, maternal high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation during the third trimester of pregnancy did not improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring during the first 6 years of life. These findings contribute essential information clarifying the effects of prenatal exposure to vitamin D on neurodevelopment in childhood.

Its latex and extracts are rich in many low-molecular compounds and proteins, but there is little or no information on their potential interaction. We describe the isolation and identification of a novel major latex protein (CmMLP1) composed of 147 amino acids and present a model of its structure containing a conserved hydrophobic cavity with high affinity to berberine, 8-hydroxycheleritrine, and dihydroberberine. CmMLP1 and the accompanying three alkaloids were present in the eluted chromatographic fractions of latex. They decreased in vitro viability of human cervical cancer cells (HPV-negative and HPV-positive). We combined, for the first time, research on macromolecular and low-molecular-weight compounds of latex-bearing plants in contrast to other studies that investigated proteins and alkaloids separately. The observed interaction between latex protein and alkaloids may influence our knowledge on plant defense. The proposed toolbox may help in further understanding of plant disease resistance and in pharmacological research.",0.9910430908203125
201,misbelief,28479277,Does celandine help with cancer?,celandine help cancer,0.0,"Background: Natural bioproducts are invaluable resources in drug discovery. Isoquinoline alkaloids of Chelidonium majus constitute a structurally diverse family of natural products that are of great interest, one of them being their selectivity for human telomeric G-quadruplex structure and telomerase inhibition. Methods: The study focuses on the mechanism of telomerase inhibition by stabilization of telomeric G-quadruplex structures by berberine, chelerythrine, chelidonine, sanguinarine and papaverine. Telomerase activity and mRNA levels of hTERT were estimated using quantitative telomere repeat amplification protocol (q-TRAP) and qPCR, in MCF-7 cells treated with different groups of alkaloids. The selectivity of the main isoquinoline alkaloids of Chelidonium majus towards telomeric G-quadruplex forming sequences were explored using a sensitive modified thermal FRET-melting measurement in the presence of the complementary oligonucleotide CT22. We assessed and monitored G-quadruplex topologies using circular dichroism (CD) methods, and compared spectra to previously well-characterized motifs, either alone or in the presence of the alkaloids. Molecular modeling was performed to rationalize ligand binding to the G-quadruplex structure. Results: The results highlight strong inhibitory effects of chelerythrine, sanguinarine and berberine on telomerase activity, most likely through substrate sequestration. These isoquinoline alkaloids interacted strongly with telomeric sequence G-quadruplex. In comparison, chelidonine and papaverine had no significant interaction with the telomeric quadruplex, while they strongly inhibited telomerase at transcription level of hTERT. Altogether, all of the studied alkaloids showed various levels and mechanisms of telomerase inhibition. Conclusions: We report on a comparative study of anti-telomerase activity of the isoquinoline alkaloids of Chelidonium majus. Chelerythrine was most effective in inhibiting telomerase activity by substrate sequesteration through G-quadruplex stabilization. General significance: Understanding structural and molecular mechanisms of anti-cancer agents can help in developing new and more potent drugs with fewer side effects. Isoquinolines are the most biologically active agents from Chelidonium majus, which have shown to be telomeric G-quadruplex stabilizers and potent telomerase inhibitors.",0.9997707009315491
205,misbelief,30269301,Does garlic help with thrush?,garlic help thrush,0.0,"When it comes to women's health, treating vaginal infections makes up a high proportion of the gynecological services. Among the forms of vaginitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is considered the second most common. Demand for new treatment alternatives is increasingly relevant, especially for therapies with fewer side effects, better tolerability, and lower cost, while still offering improved quality of life in terms of disease prevention. This study intended to investigate the alternative therapies described for the adjuvant treatment of vulvovaginitis caused by Candida species, including alternative and complementary treatment methods used by women. This literature review is based on articles written in English and Portuguese in the PubMed, Google Scholar, and SciELO databases. This study was conducted for the most part using the Brazilian Government's Capes Periodicals Portal, which directs to Google Scholar and PubMed. Since the 1980s, there has been growing interest in alternative therapies in Brazil, a trend which also began in other Western countries in the second half of the twentieth century. Some alternative treatments include substances with antifungal activity, some substances help restore the balance of the vaginal microbiota, while others have an inhibitory activity on microbial virulence factors. The proper use of therapeutic alternatives can effectively contribute to the treatment of VVC, but it should be remembered that some chemical products, such as boric acid or vinegar, and even natural products such as propolis, garlic, and tea tree may have undesirable side effects, having not been tested by well-designed clinical studies.

Although such chemical burns typically are associated with misuse of analgesics, investigators also have reported them in conjunction with topical application of a variety of other agents. Case description: The authors report an unusual case of a 49-year-old man seeking care for maxillary tooth pain who had an oral mucosal burn of the maxillary vestibule caused by topical application of crushed raw garlic. The patient believed this treatment would alleviate his dental pain. Localized tissue necrosis was visible at the site of application. The authors instructed the patient to cease self-treatment with raw garlic but deemed treatment was otherwise unnecessary. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the second reported case of a garlic burn of the oral mucosa. The authors discuss the history of garlic as a naturopathic remedy, as well as the development of chemical burns associated with its topical use. The authors also review the literature on chemical burns caused by inappropriate self-treatment. Conclusions and practical implications: Dentists should consider the possibility of an oral chemical burn when a patient has a destructive or necrotic mucosal lesion located near a painful tooth. In this report, the authors highlight the importance of obtaining a detailed clinical history to establish a proper diagnosis and proper patient education to prevent future mucosal injury from inappropriate self-treatment. Awareness and early recognition of this condition also will help diminish the probability of overtreatment.",0.003988783340901136
208,misbelief,35894479,Can pregnant women drink coffee?,pregnant drink coffee,0.0,"Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages in the world. The impact of coffee consumption on human health has been the subject of many clinical studies and meta-analyses. Taking into account the results of these studies, it can be concluded that coffee has a number of health benefits in terms of the population, including the reduction of the risk of death from any cause. From a clinical point of view, the safety of coffee consumption in a specific subpopulation of pregnant women is important. A large percentage of women continue to consume this drink during pregnancy, while a significant proportion of them exceed the permissible daily dose of caffeine (≤ 200 mg). During pregnancy, the metabolism of caffeine slows down significantly, which prolongs its action and penetrates into the body of the fetus. These biochemical observations have become the driving force behind numerous clinical studies assessing the impact of coffee consumption during pregnancy on its course, complications and the health of the newborn. This review article summarizes the current knowledge of these important issues.",0.9998570680618286

The NF comprises the skin (exocarp), pulp (mesocarp), mucilage (pectin), parchment (endocarp) and a portion of the silver skin of the coffee fruit, and consists mainly of digestible carbohydrates, dietary fibre and water. The Panel considers that there are no safety concerns regarding the stability of the NF if the NF complies with the proposed specification limits during its entire shelf-life. The NF as such will not be consumed, instead, beverages produced with the infusion of the NF in water will be available to consumers. Considering an 100% extraction of caffeine from the NF to the beverage, the specification limit set for caffeine and the proposed use levels, the maximum concentration of caffeine in infusions produced using the NF could be up to 600 mg/L of drink, a concentration comparable to those in coffee beverages. The Panel notes that consumption of beverages produced using the NF will add significantly to the total dietary intake of caffeine of the general population. The consumption of beverages containing caffeine is not recommended for children, pregnant or breast-feeding women if the caffeine content exceeds 150 mg/L. Taking into account the nature of the NF, the history of use of the NF as food and the proposed uses and use levels, the Panel considers that no toxicological studies are required on the NF. The risk of allergic reactions to the NF is considered low. The Panel concludes that the NF, dried husk of the fruit of Coffea arabica L., is safe under the proposed conditions of use.",0.04422000050544739

We examined food-based dietary intake in pregnant women with and without HIV at first antenatal care (ANC) visit, and associations with maternal overweight/obesity and gestational weight gain (GWG). Methods: In an urban South African community, consecutive women living with (n = 479) and without (n = 510) HIV were enrolled and prospectively followed to delivery. Interviewer-administered non-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake (starch, protein, dairy, fruits, vegetables, legumes, oils/fats) at enrolment. Associations with maternal body mass index (BMI) and GWG were examined using logistic regression models. Results: Among women (median age 29 years, IQR 25-34), the prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) at first ANC was 43% and that of excessive GWG (per IOM guidelines) was 37% overall; HIV prevalence was 48%. In women without HIV, consumption of potato (any preparation) (aOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.02-3.84) and pumpkin/butternut (aOR 2.13, 95% CI 1.29-3.49) for 1-3 days a week increased the odds of overweight/obesity compared to not consuming any; milk in tea/coffee (aOR 6.04, 95% CI 1.37-26.50) increased the odds of excessive GWG. Consumption of eggs (any) (aOR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32-0.86) for 1-3 days a week reduced the odds of overweight/obesity while peanut and nuts consumption for 4-7 days a week reduced the odds (aOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.80) of excessive GWG. In women with HIV, consumption of milk/yoghurt/maas to drink/on cereals (aOR 0.35, 95% CI 0.18-0.68), tomato (raw/cooked) (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30-0.84), green beans (aOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.86), mixed vegetables (aOR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29-0.84) and legumes e.g. baked beans, lentils (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.86) for 4-7 days a week reduced the odds of overweight/obesity; tomato (raw/cooked) (aOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.96) and mixed vegetables (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.78) also reduced the odds of excessive GWG.

Data regarding the association of caffeine intake and stillbirth are varied. We aimed to investigate the degree of consumption of caffeinated drinks or soft drinks in the last four weeks of pregnancy in women who experienced a late stillbirth compared to women with ongoing live pregnancies at similar gestation. Influences on maternal caffeine intake and soft drink consumption during pregnancy were also investigated. Study design: A case-control study undertaken in 41 maternity units in the United Kingdom. Cases were women who had a singleton non-anomalous stillbirth ≥28 weeks' gestation (n = 290) and controls were women with an ongoing pregnancy at the time of interview (n = 729). Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire which included questions regarding consumption of a variety of caffeinated drinks and soft drinks in the last four weeks of pregnancy as well as other behaviours (e.g. cigarette smoking). Results: Multivariable analysis adjusting for co-existing demographic and behavioural factors found the consumption of instant coffee, energy drinks and cola were associated with increased risk of stillbirth. There was an independent association between caffeine intake and late stillbirth (adjusted Odds Ratio 1.27, 95 % Confidence Interval (95 %CI) 1.14, 1.43 for each 100 mg increment/day). 15 % of cases and 8% of controls consumed more than the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendation (&gt;300 mg of caffeine/day; aOR 2.30, 95 % CI 1.40, 4.24). The population attributable risk for stillbirth associated with &gt;300 mg of caffeine/day was 7.4 %. The majority of respondents reduced caffeine consumption in pregnancy. Midwives and internet resources were the most frequently used sources of information which influenced maternal behaviour with regard to soft drinks and caffeine, and this did not differ between cases and controls.

The percentage of women drinking coffee (38 % v. 10 %, P 0.001), sugar-sweetened beverages (10 % v. 6 %, P=0.011) and artificially sweetened beverages (12 % v. 9 %, P=0.001) at least daily decreased significantly from pre-pregnancy to early pregnancy, while the percentage of women who reported to drink water (85 % v. 92 %, P 0.001), fruit juice (14 % v. 20 %, P=0.001) and milk (37 % v. 42 %, P=0.001) at least daily increased significantly. From pre-pregnancy to early pregnancy higher educated women reduced their consumption frequency of coffee significantly more than women with lower education. Older women reduced their consumption frequency of coffee and artificially sweetened beverages and increased their consumption frequency of fruit juice and milk significantly more than younger women. Conclusions: There is a significant change in beverage consumption from pre-pregnancy to early pregnancy among Norwegian nulliparous women.",0.9996428489685059

Methods: A total of 177 Malay pregnant women participated in the validation study while 85 of them participated in the reproducibility study which was carried out in the antenatal clinic of Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital. The newly developed FFQ was validated against two 24-hour dietary recalls (DR). The FFQ was repeated 20 to 28 days apart. Results: Results showed that the FFQ moderately over-estimated the nutrient and food intakes compared to the DR. Spearman correlation coefficients for nutrients ranged from 0.24 (fat) to 0.61 (calcium) and for foods, ranged from 0.13 (organ meats, onion and garlic) to 0.57 (malt drink). For nutrients, 72 to 85% of women were classified into the correct quartiles from the FFQ and the DR while for foods, 67 to 85% of women were classified correctly. Bland-Altman plot showed relatively good agreement between these two dietary methods. The intra-class correlation (ICC) was used to estimate reproducibility. It ranged from 0.75 (vitamin C) to 0.94 (phosphorus) for nutrients while it ranged from 0.73 (confectionary) to 0.96 (coffee) for foods. Conclusion: On average, at least 90% of pregnant women were correctly classified into the quartiles for nutrients and foods from the two sets of the FFQ. The FFQ presented acceptable reproducibility and appears to be a valid tool for categorising pregnant women according to dietary intake.",0.9997302889823914

Epidemiological investigation has shown that polyphenol intake is negatively correlated with the incidence of MS. Natural polyphenols are widely found in cocoa beans, tea, vegetables, fruits, and some Chinese herbal medicines; they are a class of plant compounds containing a variety of phenolic structural units, which are potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents in plants. Polyphenols are composed of flavonoids (such as flavanols, anthocyanidins, anthocyanins, isoflavones, etc. ) and non-flavonoids (such as phenolic acids, stilbenes, and lignans). Modern pharmacological studies have proved that polyphenols can reduce blood pressure, improve lipid metabolism, lower blood glucose, and reduce body weight, thereby preventing and improving MS. Due to the unique characteristics and potential development and application value of polyphenols, this review summarizes some natural polyphenols that could treat MS, including their chemical properties, plant sources, and pharmacological action against MS, to provide a basis for the further study of polyphenols in MS.",0.9998871088027954

Polyphenols are a large group of naturally occurring bioactive compounds, classified into two main classes: non-flavonoids and flavonoids. Flavonoids are distributed in foods, such as fruits, vegetables, tea, red wine, and cocoa. Studies have already demonstrated the benefits of flavonoids on the cardiovascular and nervous systems, as well as cancer cells. The present review summarizes the results of clinical studies that evaluated the effects of flavonoids on the components of the MetS and associated complications when offered as supplements over the long term. The results show that flavonoids can significantly modulate several metabolic parameters, such as lipid profile, blood pressure, and blood glucose. Only theaflavin and catechin were unable to affect metabolic parameters. Moreover, only body weight and body mass index were unaltered. Thus, the evidence presented in this systematic review offers bases in support of a flavonoid supplementation, held for at least 3 weeks, as a strategy to improve several metabolic parameters and, consequently, reduce the risk of diseases associated with MetS. This fact becomes stronger due to the rare side effects reported with flavonoids.",0.9998016953468323
209,misbelief,34627325,Can green tea reduce blood pressure?,green tea reduce blood pressure,1.0,"Background: Lei-gong-gen formula granule (LFG) is a folk prescription derived from Zhuang nationality, the largest ethnic minority among 56 nationalities in China. It consists of three herbs, namely Eclipta prostrata (L.) L., Smilax glabra Roxb, and Centella asiatica (L.) Urb. It has been widely used as health protection tea for hundreds of years to prevent hypertension in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The purpose of this study is to validate the antihypertensive effect of LFG on the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model, and to further identify the effective components and anti-hypertension mechanism of LFG. Methods: The effects of LFG on blood pressure, body weight, and heart rate were investigated in vivo using the SHR model. The levels of NO, ANG II, and ET-1 in the serum were measured, and pathological changes in the heart were examined by H&amp;E staining. The main active components of LFG, their corresponding targets, and hypertension associated pathways were discerned through network pharmacology analysis based on the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP), Traditional Chinese Medicine Integrated Database (TCMID), and the Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular Mechanism of Traditional Chinese Medicine (BATMAN-TCM). Then the predicted results were further verified by molecular biology experiments such as RT-qPCR and western blot. Additionally, the potential active compounds were predicted by molecular docking technology, and the chemical constituents of LFG were analyzed and identified by UPLC-QTOF/MS technology. Finally, an in vitro assay was performed to investigate the protective effects of potential active compounds against hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) induced oxidative damage in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Results: LFG could effectively reduce blood pressure and increase serum NO content in SHR model. Histological results showed that LFG could ameliorate pathological changes such as cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial inflammation. From network pharmacology analysis, 53 candidate active compounds of LFG were collected, which linked to 765 potential targets, and 828 hypertension associated targets were retrieved, from which 12 overlapped targets both related to candidate active compounds from LFG and hypertension were screened and used as the potential targets of LFG on antihypertensive effect. The molecular biology experiments of the 12 overlapped targets showed that LFG could upregulate the mRNA and protein expressions of NOS3 and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase SRC (SRC) in the thoracic aorta. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway was closely related to the expression of NOS3 and SRC. Moreover, western blot results showed that LFG significantly increased the protein expression levels of PI3K and phosphorylated AKT in SHR model, suggesting that LFG may active the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway to decrease hypertension. Molecular docking study further supported that p-hydroxybenzoic acid, cedar acid, shikimic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinic acid, linalool, and histidine can be well binding with NOS3, SRC, PI3K, and AKT. UPLC-QTOF/MS analysis confirmed that p-hydroxybenzoic acid, shikimic acid, salicylic acid, and nicotinic acid existed in LFG. Pre-treatment of HUVEC with nicotinic acid could alleviate the effect on cell viability induced by H 2 O 2 and increase the NO level in cell supernatants. Conclusions: LFG can reduce the blood pressure in SHR model, which might be attributed to increasing the NO level in serum for promoting vasodilation via upregulating SRC expression level and activating the PI3K-AKT-NOS3 signaling pathway. Nicotinic acid might be the potential compound for LFG antihypertensive effect.",0.9998227953910828

This study conducted to examine the health effects of tea consumption on blood pressure progression and hypertension incidence. Methods: A population-based cohort of 38,913 Chinese participants without hypertension at baseline were included in the current study. Information on tea consumption was collected through standardized questionnaires. Associations of tea consumption with blood pressure progression and incident hypertension were analyzed using logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazards regression models, respectively. Results: During a median follow-up of 5.9 years, 17,657 individuals had experienced progression to a higher blood pressure stage and 5,935 individuals had developed hypertension. In multivariate analyses, habitual tea drinkers (≥ 3 times/week for at least six months) had a 17% lower risk for blood pressure progression [odds ratio (OR) = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.79-0.88] and a 14% decreased risk for incident hypertension [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.80-0.91] compared with non-habitual tea drinkers. Individuals in different baseline blood pressure groups could obtain similar benefit from habitual tea drinking. In terms of tea consumption amount, an inverse, linear dose-response relation between monthly consumption of tea leaves and risk of blood pressure progression was observed, while the risk of incident hypertension did not reduce further after consuming around 100 g of tea leaves per month. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that habitual tea consumption could provide preventive effect against blood pressure progression and hypertension incidence.",0.9997920393943787

This systematic review aimed to determine whether providing food to patients in primary care can help to reduce body weight. Methods: Four databases were searched for studies that aimed to elicit weight loss by directly providing foodstuffs and/or supplements to patients in primary care settings. Interventions with adults of any gender or race were included. Interventions that involved other components such as exercise classes or education sessions were excluded. The methodological quality of each study was appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Results: Four heterogeneous studies met the eligibility criteria, representing 476 adults. Two studies used meal-replacement products but differed in length and intensity, another study provided green tea and vitamin E supplementation, and the final study provided vouchers for use at a farmers' market hosted at a primary care clinic. Interventions ranged in length from 4 to 13 weeks. Three of the four studies observed weight loss in some form and all studies observed at least one other improvement in a health outcome such as waist circumference, blood pressure or fasting insulin levels. Conclusions: A small yet notable body of literature supports the concept of providing food to patients in primary care settings to support weight loss. Further, high-quality research is needed on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach to ultimately inform policy initiatives for primary care.",0.9997219443321228

In the acute test, IELAc-1.5 at 300 mg/kg bodyweight (bw) exhibited antihyperglycemic activity on STID mice since the first hour of treatment. Then, its antidiabetic potential was analyzed in a subchronic evaluation. IELAc-1.5 was able to reduce the blood glucose level, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol (CHO), and triglycerides (TG); high-density lipoprotein (HDL) showed an increase at the end of treatment. IELAc-1.5 did not modify the urine profile at the end of the evaluation, and neither toxicity nor macroscopic organ damage were observed in acute and subchronic assays. In addition, a major flavonol glycoside present in the tea infusion extracts was identified using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). The analysis of the tea infusion extracts by HPLC revealed that rutin was the major component. This study supports the use of tea infusions from Annona cherimola for the treatment of diabetes and suggests that rutin could be responsible, at least in part, for their antidiabetic properties.",0.999409556388855

We aim to describe dietary flavonoid intakes in a Taiwanese nationally representative sample and to investigate the association between flavonoid intakes and CRP. We conducted a cross-sectional study based on 2592 adults from the Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan 2005-8. Flavonoid intakes were estimated by linking the 24-h dietary recall with the U.S. Department of Agriculture flavonoid database and divided into quartiles. Adjusted estimates of the flavonoid intakes for the continuous and binary (elevated CRP: &gt;0⋅3 mg/dl) variables were performed by using general linear and logistic regression. We found that tea, orange, tofu and sweet potato leaves/water spinach constituted the major food items of the total flavonoid intake. The total flavonoid intake was lower among women and elderly. Compared with the lowest total flavonoid intake quartile, participants in higher quartiles were associated with a lower CRP status (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0⋅61, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0⋅44-0⋅86 for the highest quartiles). The trends were similar for flavonol and flavan-3-ol intakes. Compared with non-consumers, tea consumers were likely to have a lower CRP status (adjusted OR: 0⋅74, 95 % CI: 0⋅57-0⋅97). In brief, a higher total flavonoid intake and tea consumption were inversely associated with CRP levels, indicating that a high-flavonoid diet may contribute to anti-inflammatory effects.

Sharma is a traditional medicinal plant used in Siddha System of Medicine and its aromatic root is used to reduce the elevated blood pressure. Aim: The aim of the present study was to study vasorelaxant property of the root essential oil nanoemulsion (EON) of P. vettiveroides. Methods: The EON was formulated to enhance the solubility and bioavailability and characterized. The preliminary screening was performed by treating the EON with aortic rings pre-contracted with phenylephrine (1 μM) and potassium chloride (80 mM). The role of K⁺ channels in EON induced vasorelaxation was investigated by pre-incubating the aortic rings with different K⁺ channel inhibitors namely, glibenclamide (a non-specific ATP sensitive K⁺ channel blocker, 10 μM), TEA (a Ca<sup>2</sup>⁺ activated non-selective K⁺ channel blocker, 10<sup>-2</sup> M), 4-AP (a voltage-activated K⁺ channel blocker, 10<sup>-3</sup> M) and barium chloride (inward rectifier K⁺ channel blocker, 1 mM). The involvement of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was performed by adding cumulative dose of extracellular calcium in the presence and absence of EON and the concentration-response curve (CRC) obtained is compared. Similarly, the role of nitric oxide synthase, muscarinic and prostacyclin receptors on EON induced vasorelaxation were evaluated by pre-incubating the aortic rings with their inhibitors and the CRC obtained in the presence and absence of inhibitor were compared. Results: The GC-MS and GC-FID analyses of the root essential oil revealed the presence of 62 volatile compounds. The EON exhibited significant vasorelaxant effect through nitric oxide-mediated pathway, G-protein coupled muscarinic (M 3 ) receptor pathway, involvement of K<sup>+</sup> channels (K ATP , K IR , K Ca ), and blocking of the calcium influx by receptor-operated calcium channel. Conclusion: It is concluded that the root essential oil of P. vettiveroides is possessing marked vasorelaxant property.

Design: Survey. Setting: Newfoundland and Labrador. Participants: Parents waiting in their family doctors' offices. Main outcome measures: Parent and child demographic characteristics; pediatric chronic medical conditions affecting the children; prescribed medications, over-the-counter medications, and NHPs used by the children; why the medications and NHPs were being used, the dose, and parents' assessments of the effectiveness and side effects; and where parents had heard about the NHPs, whether they had told their physicians that the children were taking the products, and where they had obtained the products. Results: A total of 202 (53.4%) of the 378 eligible adults who were approached completed the survey. This represented 333 children. Mean (SD) age of the children was 5.1 (3.3) years. Overall, 28.7% of parents reported using nonvitamin NHPs for their children. A total of 137 children (41.1%) had taken NHPs (including vitamins); 61.1% of the NHPs being used were vitamins. The remainder fell under teas (primarily chamomile and green teas), echinacea, fish or omega-3 oils, and a large category of ""other"" products. These NHPs were most commonly used to improve general health, improve immunity, and prevent colds and infections. Approximately half of the parents (51.7%) believed their children had benefited from taking NHPs, and 4.4% believed their children had experienced adverse side effects.

To maintain robust immunity, athletes should eat a well-balanced diet sufficient to meet their energy, carbohydrate, protein, and micronutrient requirements. Dietary deficiencies of protein and specific micronutrients have long been associated with immune dysfunction and an adequate intake of iron, zinc, and vitamins A, D, E, B6 and B12 is particularly important in the maintenance of immune function. Consuming carbohydrate during prolonged strenuous exercise attenuates rises in stress hormones and appears to limit the degree of exercise-induced immune depression. Similar effects can be seen with daily ingestion of high-dose antioxidant vitamin supplements, though concerns have been expressed that excessive antioxidant intake may impair exercise training adaptations. It is safe to say with reasonable confidence that individual amino acids, colostrum, Echinacea, and zinc are unlikely to boost immunity or reduce infection risk in athletes. The ingestion of carbohydrate during exercise and daily consumption of probiotic and plant polyphenol (e.g. quercetin)-containing supplements or foodstuffs (e.g. non-alcoholic beer) currently offer the best chance of success.

We aimed to investigate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of fourth-dose boosters against COVID-19. Methods: The COV-BOOST trial is a multicentre, blinded, phase 2, randomised controlled trial of seven COVID-19 vaccines given as third-dose boosters at 18 sites in the UK. This sub-study enrolled participants who had received BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) as their third dose in COV-BOOST and randomly assigned them (1:1) to receive a fourth dose of either BNT162b2 (30 μg in 0·30 mL; full dose) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna; 50 μg in 0·25 mL; half dose) via intramuscular injection into the upper arm. The computer-generated randomisation list was created by the study statisticians with random block sizes of two or four. Participants and all study staff not delivering the vaccines were masked to treatment allocation. The coprimary outcomes were safety and reactogenicity, and immunogenicity (anti-spike protein IgG titres by ELISA and cellular immune response by ELISpot). We compared immunogenicity at 28 days after the third dose versus 14 days after the fourth dose and at day 0 versus day 14 relative to the fourth dose. Safety and reactogenicity were assessed in the per-protocol population, which comprised all participants who received a fourth-dose booster regardless of their SARS-CoV-2 serostatus. Immunogenicity was primarily analysed in a modified intention-to-treat population comprising seronegative participants who had received a fourth-dose booster and had available endpoint data. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, 73765130, and is ongoing. Findings: Between Jan 11 and Jan 25, 2022, 166 participants were screened, randomly assigned, and received either full-dose BNT162b2 (n=83) or half-dose mRNA-1273 (n=83) as a fourth dose. The median age of these participants was 70·1 years (IQR 51·6-77·5) and 86 (52%) of 166 participants were female and 80 (48%) were male. The median interval between the third and fourth doses was 208·5 days (IQR 203·3-214·8). Pain was the most common local solicited adverse event and fatigue was the most common systemic solicited adverse event after BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 booster doses. None of three serious adverse events reported after a fourth dose with BNT162b2 were related to the study vaccine. In the BNT162b2 group, geometric mean anti-spike protein IgG concentration at day 28 after the third dose was 23 325 ELISA laboratory units (ELU)/mL (95% CI 20 030-27 162), which increased to 37 460 ELU/mL (31 996-43 857) at day 14 after the fourth dose, representing a significant fold change (geometric mean 1·59, 95% CI 1·41-1·78). There was a significant increase in geometric mean anti-spike protein IgG concentration from 28 days after the third dose (25 317 ELU/mL, 95% CI 20 996-30 528) to 14 days after a fourth dose of mRNA-1273 (54 936 ELU/mL, 46 826-64 452), with a geometric mean fold change of 2·19 (1·90-2·52). The fold changes in anti-spike protein IgG titres from before (day 0) to after (day 14) the fourth dose were 12·19 (95% CI 10·37-14·32) and 15·90 (12·92-19·58) in the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 groups, respectively. T-cell responses were also boosted after the fourth dose (eg, the fold changes for the wild-type variant from before to after the fourth dose were 7·32 [95% CI 3·24-16·54] in the BNT162b2 group and 6·22 [3·90-9·92] in the mRNA-1273 group). Interpretation: Fourth-dose COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccines are well tolerated and boost cellular and humoral immunity. Peak responses after the fourth dose were similar to, and possibly better than, peak responses after the third dose.

213,misbelief,33296402,Does honey boost immunity?,honey boost immunity,1.0,"For the past decade, migratory beekeepers who provide honey bees for pollination services have experienced substantial colony losses on a recurring basis that have been attributed in part to exposure to insecticides, fungicides, or their combinations applied to crops. The phytochemicals p-coumaric acid and quercetin, which occur naturally in a wide variety of bee foods, including beebread and many types of honey, can enhance adult bee longevity and reduce the toxicity of certain pesticides. How variation in concentrations of natural dietary constituents affects interactions with xenobiotics, including synthetic pesticides, encountered in agroecosystems remains an open question. We tested the effects of these two phytochemicals at a range of natural concentrations on impacts of consuming propiconazole and chlorantraniliprole, a triazole fungicide and an insecticide frequently applied as a tank mix to almond trees during bloom in California's Central Valley. Propiconazole, even at low field concentrations, significantly reduced survival and longevity when consumed by adult bees in a sugar-based diet. The effects of propiconazole in combination with chlorantraniliprole enhanced mortality risk. The detrimental effects of the two pesticides were for the most part reduced when either or both of the phytochemicals were present in the diet. These findings suggest that honey bees may depend on non-nutritive but physiologically active phytochemical components of their natural foods for ameliorating xenobiotic stress, although only over a certain range of concentrations; particularly at the high end of the natural range, certain combinations can incur additive toxicity. Thus, efforts to develop nectar or pollen substitutes with phytochemicals to boost insecticide tolerance or immunity or to evaluate toxicity of pesticides to pollinators should take concentration-dependent effects of phytochemicals into consideration.",0.9801924824714661
213,misbelief,26802559,Does honey boost immunity?,honey boost immunity,1.0,"Multiple stressors are currently threatening honey bee health, including pests and pathogens. Among honey bee pathogens, Nosema ceranae is a microsporidian found parasitizing the western honey bee (Apis mellifera) relatively recently. Honey bee colonies are fed pollen or protein substitute during pollen dearth to boost colony growth and immunity against pests and pathogens. Here we hypothesize that N. ceranae intensity and prevalence will be low in bees receiving high pollen diets, and that honey bees on high pollen diets will have higher survival and/or increased longevity. To test this hypothesis we examined the effects of different quantities of pollen on (a) the intensity and prevalence of N. ceranae and (b) longevity and nutritional physiology of bees inoculated with N. ceranae. Significantly higher spore intensities were observed in treatments that received higher pollen quantities (1:0 and 1:1 pollen:cellulose) when compared to treatments that received relatively lower pollen quantities. There were no significant differences in N. ceranae prevalence among different pollen diet treatments. Interestingly, the bees in higher pollen quantity treatments also had significantly higher survival despite higher intensities of N. ceranae. Significantly higher hypopharyngeal gland protein was observed in the control (no Nosema infection, and receiving a diet of 1:0 pollen:cellulose), followed by 1:0 pollen:cellulose treatment that was inoculated with N. ceranae. Here we demonstrate that diet with higher pollen quantity increases N. ceranae intensity, but also enhances the survival or longevity of honey bees. The information from this study could potentially help beekeepers formulate appropriate protein feeding regimens for their colonies to mitigate N. ceranae problems.",0.9996613264083862

A long-lived reservoir of latently infected CD4(+) memory T cells represents the most important sanctuary for the virus and the greatest obstacle for viral eradication. In this work, we present an initial step toward a gene therapy approach aimed at the activation of latent provirus to induce the death of latently infected T cells. Latent HIV-1 infection is characterized by the failure of viral gene expression as a consequence of uninitiated or aborted transcription. We have constructed an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector (p5p53RTAT3) that expresses the viral trans-activating protein Tat in a drug-regulated manner and p53 in a Rev-dependent manner. We have demonstrated that the Tat-expressed protein from p5p53RTAT3 vector reactivates latent HIV-1 proviruses in J1.1 and ACH-2 cell lines and promotes p53-induced apoptosis in the presence of Rev. Our system was able to trigger the trans-activation of the provirus 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), stimulate the expression of the Rev protein from a tat-defective provirus, and provoke apoptosis selectively in the cells transfected with a tat-defective HIV-1 provirus in contrast to those with no HIV-1 provirus. However, the Rev-dependent p53 killing of latently infected cells was not effective enough for complete elimination of the awakened HIV-1 viruses. In summary, we have developed a vector system that is efficient in activating latent HIV-1 proviruses but that needs further improvement to kill infected cells.",0.9494171142578125

The Taiwan Cancer Registry was used to identify women with BC from 2011 to 2017. A total of 54,614 women with BC were enrolled, including 1687 smokers and 52,927 non-smokers. The outcome, mortality, was identified using Taiwan's cause-of-death database. The association between smoking status and mortality was estimated using Cox proportional regression. Women with BC who smoked had a 1.25-fold higher (95% C.I.: 1.08-1.45; p = 0.0022) risk of overall mortality and a 1.22-fold higher (95% C.I.: 1.04-1.44; p = 0.0168) risk of cancer-specific mortality compared with non-smokers.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who smoke are more likely to make a quit attempt than their non-Aboriginal counterparts but less likely to sustain the quit attempt. There is little available evidence specifically for and by Indigenous peoples to inform best practice smoking cessation care.The provision of a free Koori Quit Pack with optional nicotine replacement therapy sent by mail may be a feasible, acceptable and effective way to access stop smoking support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Methods and analysis: An Aboriginal-led, multisite non-randomised single-group, pre-post feasibility study across three states in Australia will be conducted. Participants will be recruited via service-targeted social media advertising and during usual care at their Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services. Through a process of self-referral, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who smoke daily will complete a survey and receive mailout smoking cessation support. Data will be collected over the phone by an Aboriginal Research Assistant. This pilot study will inform the development of a larger, powered trial.

Approximately 54% of individuals seeking LCS report current cigarette smoking. Effective smoking cessation interventions, offered at the time of LCS, enhances the health benefits of screening that are attributable to reductions in lung cancer overall and tobacco-related mortality. Considering these data, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS) 2015 decision to cover LCS with LDCT required that radiology imaging facilities make tobacco cessation interventions available for people who smoke. In February 2022, CMS reversed their 2015 coverage requirement for delivering tobacco use treatment at the time of LDCT; CMS retained the requirement for counseling during the shared decision-making visit prior to the exam. The policy change does not diminish the importance of offering high-quality tobacco cessation services in conjunction with routine LDCT for LCS. However, LCS programs face a range of barriers to implementing tobacco use treatment in their settings. As a result, implementation has lagged. Closing the ""evidence to practice"" gap is the focus of implementation science, a field that offers a set of rigorous methods and a systematic approach to identifying and overcoming contextual barriers to implementing evidence-based guidelines in a range of clinical settings.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with T1DM admitted with ACS to an Australian hospital was conducted. Risk factor targets were defined by 2021 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines. Outcomes were defined as an adverse cardiovascular event (ACS, unplanned revascularisation, heart failure, stroke, or cardiovascular death) or all-cause mortality within six-months after discharge. Results: 61 patients were included [age 58.5 ± 12.8 years, 39 % female]. Dyslipidaemia (85 %), hypertension (75 %), smoking (28 %), prior coronary artery disease (CAD) (44 %), and microvascular complications (62 %) were common.

Lifestyle factors such as smoking, physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet and harmful alcohol use are main risk factors that contribute to other modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension, raised blood cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes. The potential impact of area-level socio-economic status (ASES) on metabolic CVD risk factors via lifestyle behaviors independent of individual SES has not been investigated previously. Aims: To estimate associations of ASES with CVD risk factors and the mediating role of lifestyle behaviors independent of individual-level SES. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we included 19,415 participants (52% women) from the seventh survey of the Tromsø Study (2015-2016) (Tromsø7). The exposure variable ASES was created by aggregating individual-level SES variables (education, income, housing ownership) at the geographical subdivision level. Individual-level SES data and geographical subdivision of Tromsø municipality (36 areas) were obtained from Statistics Norway. Variables from questionnaires and clinical examinations obtained from Tromsø7 were used as mediators (smoking, snuff, alcohol, and physical activity), while the outcome variables were body mass index (BMI), total/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio, waist circumference, hypertension, diabetes. Mediation and mediated moderation analysis were performed with age as a moderator, stratified by sex. Results: ASES was significantly associated with all outcome variables. CVD risk factor level declined with an increase in ASES. These associations were mediated by differences in smoking habits, alcohol use and physical activity. The associations of ASES with total/HDL cholesterol ratio and waist circumference (women) were moderated by age, and the moderating effects were mediated by smoking and physical activity in both sexes. The largest mediated effects were seen in the associations of ASES with total/HDL cholesterol ratio, with the mediators accounting for 43% of the observed effects. Conclusions: Living in lower SES areas is associated with increased CVD risk due to unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, such as smoking, alcohol use and physical inactivity.

However, the anti-ultraviolet A (UVA) effect of isoflavones is more controversial. Therefore, this study aims to discover which isoflavone analogue possesses a strong anti-ultraviolet A. We found the isoflavonoid intermediate deoxybenzoin-3A (DOB-3A) to be a similar isoflavone structural compound with strong anti-ultraviolet A effects. Ultraviolet rays with a wavelength of 350 nm are used to irradiate the fibroblasts of the human skin. Western blot, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscope analyses were used to explore its anti-ultraviolet A mechanism. We established the results that DOB-3A (1) reduced the death of fibroblasts caused by ultraviolet A, (2) avoided the damage to the organelles and structures after UVA irradiation, (3) inhibited the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen peroxide-induced damage, and (4) decreased the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) caused by UVA. Based on the above findings, DOB-3A is a very good anti-ultraviolet A isoflavone-related structure.

2_h,health_belief,32547149,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"Background: In the past, it was taught that UVA wavelengths (320- 400nm) only plays a major role in skin aging but recently the scientific researches also show that UVA cause cancerous keratinocyte cells in deep layer of the epidermis. Therefore, the protective ability of the product against UVA is important in addition to protection against UVB rays. The UVA protective factor (UVA-PF) is used to evaluate the effectiveness of sunscreen products against UVA rays. This study aims to review and compare all outstanding protocols in the field of UVA-PF measurement and finally the introduction of the best method of measuring UVA-PF based on the further benefits. Materials and methods: ﻿Four standards including ISO 24443 (AS/NZS 2604: 2012 recommended approach), CEN 2006, FDA 2007 and FDA 2011 ﻿are selected. Results: In order to measure UVA-PF with in vivo method, two standards of CEN 2006 and FDA 2007 recommended persistent pigment darkening (PPD) method. Although the general principle of both is similar, there are some differences in detail. For in vitro measurement of UVA-PF, CEN and FDA 2011 standards use critical wavelengths. FDA 2007 introduces the modified Diffey fraction, and ISO 24443 standard meets the UVA-PF measurement in a manner that is consistent with PPD. Conclusion: Finally, this review discussed the comparison of all in vitro and in vivo UVA-PF measurement standards and provided information in the form of texts and tables to move towards the creation of an integrated standard. Since in vitro methods of UVA-PF measurement are not reproducible due to differences in test conditions, it may be concluded that the in vivo PPD method is a more suitable option.",0.9975377321243286
2_h,health_belief,32486363,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"Chronic exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation is a major cause for skin photoaging. UVB induces damage to skin mainly by oxidative stress, inflammation, and collagen degradation. This paper investigated the photo-protective effects of peptides from oyster ( Crassostrea hongkongensis ) protein hydrolysates (OPs) by topical application on the skin of UVB-irradiated mice. Results from mass spectrometry showed that OPs consisted of peptides with a molecular weight range of 302.17-2936.43 Da. In vivo study demonstrated that topical application of OPs on the skin significantly alleviated moisture loss, epidermal hyperplasia, as well as degradation of collagen and elastin fibers caused by chronic UVB irradiation. In this study, OPs treatment promoted antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GPH-Px) activities, while decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the skin. In addition, OPs treatment significantly decreased inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) content, and inhibited inflammation related (iNOS, COX-2) protein expression in the skin. Via inhibiting metalloproteinase 1(MMP1) expression, OPs treatment markedly decreased the degradation of collagen and elastin fibers as well as recovered the altered arrangement of extracellular matrix network in the dermis of skin. Our study demonstrated for the first time that OPs protected against UVB induced skin photodamage by virtue of its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as regulating the abnormal expression of MMP-1. The possible molecular mechanism underlying OPs anti-photoaging is possibly related to downregulating of the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, while promoting TGF-β production in the skin.",0.12322491407394409
2_h,health_belief,32445044,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"Background: Patients often seek aesthetic correction of facial deficiencies (e.g., lines and folds) that are rarely the underlying cause of dissatisfaction with their appearance. Use of a more holistic approach focused on improving the emotional messages of the face (e.g., looking less sad) may improve patient satisfaction with treatment outcomes. The MD Codes™ system was developed to increase clinician success rates by reducing variability in the technical aspects of hyaluronic acid (HA) filler treatment and focusing on addressing unfavorable emotional attributes of the face. Methods: The MD Codes, or medical codes, represent specific anatomical subunits for injection of HA fillers. Each MD Code includes information regarding the target depth of injection, the proper delivery tool (needle or cannula) and delivery technique (e.g., aliquot, bolus, fanning), and the minimum product volume recommended to achieve visible, reproducible results (active number). During treatment planning, the appropriate MD Codes are selected using algorithms focused on lessening unfavorable facial attributes (a saggy, tired, sad, or angry look) and enhancing positive attributes (an attractive, younger, more contoured, or feminine [soft] or masculine look). Results: Three case studies are presented to illustrate how the MD Codes and their algorithms were used to address sagginess, tiredness, and sadness in two women and one man. Conclusions: MD Codes provide a universal symbolic language for reducing variability in injection technique. The platform provides user-friendly algorithms to help clinicians increase patient satisfaction by going beyond treatment of lines and folds and to focus on reducing unfavorable facial attributes.

Our previous study demonstrated that low shear stress (LSS) promotes anoikis resistance of human breast carcinoma cells via caveolin-1 (Cav-1)-dependent extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. However, the underlying mechanism how LSS enhanced Cav-1 expression in suspended cancer cells remains unclear. Herein, we found that LSS induced redox signaling was involved in the regulation of Cav-1 level and anoikis resistance in suspension cultured cancer cells. Exposure of human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells to LSS (2 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>) markedly induced ROS and <sup>•</sup>NO generation, which promoted the cell viability and reduced the cancer cell apoptosis. Furthermore, ROS and <sup>•</sup>NO scavenging inhibited the upregulation of Cav-1 by interfering ubiquitination, and suppressed the anoikis resistance of suspended tumor cells. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism by which LSS-stimulated ROS and <sup>•</sup>NO generation increases Cav-1 stabilization in suspended cancer cells through inhibition of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which could be a potential target for therapy of metastatic tumors.",0.11419989168643951

We compared two cognitive rehabilitation programs to a control group in cancer survivors. Methods: Study population were adult cancer survivors with cognitive symptoms 6-60 months after adjuvant chemotherapy. Participants randomised to: Attention Process Training (APT), Compensatory Strategy Training (CST), or control group. Active interventions comprised 6-week, 2-h/week small group sessions. Assessments: pre- and post-intervention, 6- and 12-months later. Primary outcome was change in cognitive symptoms (FACT-COG-PCI subscale) between baseline and post-intervention. Secondary endpoints included objective neuropsychological performance, Functional Impact Assessment (FIA), patient-reported outcome measures, and associations. Analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis. Analysis of covariance mixed models were used for continuous outcomes. Results: Sixty-five participants were randomised (APT n = 21; CST n = 24; controls n = 20): 94% breast cancer, median age 54. Median time since chemotherapy 20.7 months. FACT-COG-PCI, clinical neuropsychological T-scores, and FIA improved in all groups over time, but no significant differences between arms. On mean neuropsychological T-scores 19/65 (29%) were impaired at baseline; post-intervention impairment controls 31.3%, CST 16.7%, APT 20.0%. On FIA at baseline, nine were impaired; this decreased to three post-intervention (one/group). FACT-COG-PCI was weakly associated with neuropsychological tests (rho = 0.24, p = 0.051) at baseline, and had no association with FIA. Neuropsychological total mean T-score was moderately positively associated with FIA (rho = 0.37, p = 0.003). Conclusion: There were no significant differences between intervention groups and controls using linear mixed models adjusted for baseline scores. Implications for cancer survivors: Cognitive symptoms and neuropsychological test scores improve over time.",0.0010852566920220852

Epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR1) is commonly overexpressed in up to 70% of TNBC cases, so targeting cancer cells via this receptor could emerge as a favored modality for TNBC therapy due to its target specificity. The development of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as carriers for siRNAs remains a rapidly growing area of research. For this purpose, a multi-functionalized KIT-6 containing the guanidinium ionic liquid (GuIL), PEI and PEGylated folic acid (FA-PEG) was designed. Accordingly, KIT-6 was fabricated and modified with FA-PEG and PEI polymers attached on the surface and the GuIL placed in the mesopores. Subsequent to confirming the structure of this multi-functionalized KIT-6- based nanocarrier using TEM, SEM, AFM, BET, BJH, DLS and Zeta Potential, it was investigated for uploading and transferring the anti-EGFR1 siRNAs to the MD-MBA-231 cell line. The rate of cellular uptake, cellular localization and endolysosomal escape was evaluated based on the fluorescent intensity of FAM-labelled siRNA using flowcytometry analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The 64% cellular uptake after 4 h incubation, clearly suggested the successful delivery of siRNA into the cells and, CLSM demonstrated that siRNA@[FA-PEGylated/PEI@GuIL@KIT-6] may escape endosomal entrapment after 6 h incubation. Using qPCR, quantitative evaluation of EGFR1 gene expression, a knockdown of 82% was found, which resulted in a functional change in the expression of EGFR1 targets. Co-treatment of chemotherapy drug ""carboplatin"" in combination with siRNA@[FA-PEGylated/PEI@GuIL@KIT-6] exhibited a remarkable cytotoxic effect in comparison to carboplatin alone.",0.4719378352165222

In the last years, several new HER2-targeted therapies, including antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have been approved for therapy after trastuzumab or dual blockade. In this review, the current treatment algorithms are discussed, including these new treatment options. Recent findings: The ADC T-DM1 was the established second-line standard based on the results of the EMILIA trial. Recently, the DESTINY-Breast03 trial compared T-DM1 with the new ADC trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in patients with disease progression after treatment with taxanes and trastuzumab. T-DXd was associated with an improved progression-free survival and a trend toward improved overall survival, establishing T-DXd as a new second-line standard. The HER2CLIMB trial demonstrated a significant progression-free survival and overall survival benefit for the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine after T-DM1 and trastuzumab/pertuzumab. This benefit was also observed in patients with active brain metastases defining this combination as the preferred second or third-line option in these patients. Summary: New treatment strategies in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer have substantially improved the clinical outcome of these patients, including those with active brain metastases.",0.9992544054985046

VEGF has been demonstrated to be important in the clinic as a therapeutic target in the anti-angiogenic approach to cancer therapy. The targeting of VEGF, together with immunotherapy, has been reported to be able to reverse the immunosuppressive effects of VEGF.

3_h,health_belief,36237767,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"Introduction Metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) is a rare malignancy that accounts for 1% of all breast cancers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinicopathologic characteristics of MBC patients treated at a tertiary cancer center. Materials and methods In this study, the authors retrospectively analyzed the prospectively maintained data of MBC patients treated at a tertiary cancer care center in North India between January 2019 and July 2022. Results A total of 28 MBCs were identified. The median age of presentation was 47 years (range 27-81 years). Seventeen patients (60.7%) presented with clinical T3/T4 disease, and axillary nodal involvement was detected in 11 patients (39.3%) at presentation. Two patients had metastatic disease at presentation. A preoperative diagnosis of MBC on core biopsy was attained in five patients (17.9%), and the most common histologic subtype was sarcomatoid carcinoma. Triple-negative receptor status was observed in 15 patients (53.6%). Six patients (21.4%) underwent upfront breast conservation surgery and another six (21.4%) upfront mastectomy. Thirteen patients (46.4%) underwent mastectomy following neoadjuvant therapy. Definitive axillary nodal metastasis was found in eight patients (32%). Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, five patients (35.7%) had stable disease, disease progression was evident in five patients (35.7%), partial response in four patients (28.6%), and no patient evinced complete response. Adjuvant postoperative radiation therapy was administered in 16 patients (57.1%). At a median follow-up of 13.2 months (range 4-26 months), 16 patients (57.1%) were alive with no evidence of disease, one patient (3.6%) was alive with disease, nine patients (32.1%) died of disease, and two patients (7.2%) died of other causes. One patient suffered from locoregional recurrence and nine patients developed distant metastasis. Conclusion MBC is an infrequent entity among breast carcinomas in India, which is similar to the reports of MBC worldwide. The diagnosis of MBC is difficult and requires the use of immunohistochemistry. Most of the cases in our study presented with a larger tumor size; however, they displayed a relatively lower incidence of nodal involvement as well as hormone receptor negativity. Being a rare and heterogeneous disease, large-scale studies are essential for better understanding and management of these tumors.",0.9994499087333679

From a prospectively built breast cancer registry, a total of 210 metastatic breast cancer patients were selected in a consecutive manner using inclusion/exclusion criteria. The patients' data were divided into two categories: a group that survived for more than 5 years and a group that did not survive for 5 years. For the AI model input, 11 features were considered, including age, body mass index, skeletal muscle area (SMA), height-relative SMA (H-SMI), height square-relative SMA (H<sup>2</sup>-SMA), weight-relative SMA (W-SMA), muscle mass, anticancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and comorbid diseases such as hypertension and mellitus. For the feature importance analysis, we compared classifiers using six different machine learning algorithms and found that extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) provided the best accuracy. Subsequently, we performed the feature importance analysis based on XGBoost and proposed a 4-layer deep neural network, which considered the top 10 ranked features. Our proposed 4-layer deep neural network provided high sensitivity (75.00%), specificity (78.94%), accuracy (78.57%), balanced accuracy (76.97%), and an area under receiver operating characteristics of 0.90.

The patient was identified as a BRCA1 mutation carrier and treated with four cycles of adriamycin and cyclophosphamide, followed by four cycles of docetaxel. Bilateral breast cancer stages decreased with the first regimen. However, the bilateral breast cancers showed discrepant responses to chemotherapy with docetaxel. The right breast cancer showed a continuous tumor volume reduction while the left breast cancer showed marked progression. Finally, the tumor size was 0.3 cm and 12 cm in the right and left mastectomy specimens, respectively.

We sought to compare cancer mortality in people on dialysis for kidney failure with cancer mortality in the general population. Study design: A retrospective cohort study using linked health-administrative and dialysis registry data. Setting &amp; participants: All people receiving dialysis represented in the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplantation Registry, 1980-2013. Exposure: Dialysis; hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Outcome: Death and underlying cause of death ascertained using health administrative data and classified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) codes. Analytical approach: Indirect standardization on age at death, sex, year, and country to estimate standardized mortality ratios (SMR). Results: Over 269,598 person years of observation, 34,100 deaths occurred among 59,648 people on dialysis, including 3,677 cancer deaths. The relative risk of all-site cancer death in dialysis was twice (SMR, 2.4 [95% CI, 2.33-2.49]) that of the general population and highest for oral and pharynx cancers (SMR, 24.3 [95% CI, 18.0-31.5]) and multiple myeloma (SMR, 22.5 [95% CI, 20.3-23.9]). Women on dialysis had a significantly higher risk of all-site cancer mortality (SMR, 2.7 [95% CI, 2.59-2.89]) compared with men (SMR, 2.3 [95% CI, 2.17-2.36]) (P 0.001). People on HD (SMR, 2.2 [95% CI, 2.11-2.30]) experienced greater excess deaths from all-site cancer compared with people on PD (SMR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.23-1.44]). Excess deaths have gradually decreased over time for all-site, multiple myeloma, and kidney cancers (P 0.001) but have not kept up with improvements in the general population. By contrast, among people receiving dialysis, excess deaths increased for colorectal and lung cancers (P 0.001). Limitations: Confirmation of cancer diagnoses and population incidence data were not available; inability to exclude pre-existing cancers. Conclusions: People on dialysis experience excess all-site and site-specific cancer mortality compared with the general population. Mortality differs by modality type, age, and sex. Understanding the role of kidney failure and other morbidities in the treatment of cancer is important for shared decision-making regarding cancer treatments and identifying potential approaches to improve outcomes.",0.0023620417341589928

This study aimed to analyze the trends of incidence and mortality caused by lip, oral cavity, and pharynx cancers and age-period-cohort effects in the Brazilian population of 30 years of age and over, in the period of 1990 to 2019. Methods: A time series study of the incidence and mortality rates for oral cavity and pharynx cancer (""Lip and oral cavity cancer"", ""Nasopharynx cancer"", and ""Other pharynx cancer"") was conducted, with corrected data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. Age-standardized rates per 100,000 inhabitants, for the global population, were gathered according to the individuals' sex. The annual average percentage change (AAPC) was estimated, as was the age-period-cohort effects. Results: The incidence and mortality rates were higher for men in the studied anatomical regions. The cancers tended to decrease for men, except for nasopharynx cancer, which increased in individuals of both sexes. Mortality tended to present a decline in most of the groups studied. For men and women, the age-period-cohort model presented a better adjustment for both incidence and mortality. Conclusions: Incidence and mortality caused by the main head and neck cancers showed a tendency to decline over the past 30 years in Brazil, except for nasopharynx cancer, which showed an increase in incidence and mortality in some segments of the population.

4_h,health_belief,34663328,Does oral sex cause throat cancer?,oral sex causes throat cancer,1.0,"Background: As the survival rates of cancer patients continue to increase, most cancer patients now die of non-cancer causes. Several studies have been showing elevated suicide rates among patients with cancer. However, no large-scale study has thoroughly assessed the risk of suicide among adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer. This study was conducted to characterize suicide mortality among AYA patients in the US and identify risk factors associated with a higher risk of suicide. Methods: Patients aged 15-39 years were residents of the US served by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, who were diagnosed with cancers from 1973 to 2015. Results: We report that 981 of the 572,500 AYA patients with cancer committed suicide, for an age-, sex-, and race-adjusted suicide rate of 17.68/100,000 person-years. The rate of suicide was 14.33/100,000 person-years in the corresponding general population, giving a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.234 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.159-1.313]. Higher suicide rates were associated with male sex, white race, unmarried state, distant tumor stage, and single primary tumor. AYA patients with otorhinolaryngologic, gonad, stomach, soft tissue, and nasopharyngeal cancer were at the greatest risk of suicide compared with those with other types of cancer. In older patients (≥ 40 years), the risk was highest in those with lung, stomach, oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, and bone malignancies. SMRs were highest in the first 5 years after diagnosis for most types of cancer. Conclusion: AYA patients with cancer in the US have over 20% higher the incidence of suicide of the general population, and most suicides occurred in the first 5 years following diagnosis. Suicide rates vary among patients with cancers of different anatomic sites. Further examination of the psychological experience of these young patients with cancer, particularly that of those with certain types of cancer, is warranted.",0.0009298862423747778

Despite the longstanding decline in smoking prevalence, lung cancer remains one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in both sexes. We aimed to estimate the current cancer burden attributable to smoking in Europe. Methods: Smoking-related cancer incidence by country, cancer type, sex and age in Europe was estimated from GLOBOCAN 2018. We applied a modified version of the indirect method to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF) for lung cancer and applied Levin's formula to estimate the PAF for other smoking-related cancer sites. Results: In Europe in 2018, 572,000 and 186,000 cancer cases were attributable to tobacco smoking in males and females respectively, accounting for 28% (males) and 10% (females) of all cancer cases. By region, the largest and the lowest PAF due to smoking in males occurred in Eastern Europe (35% of all cancer cases) and Northern Europe (21%), respectively. Among women, this pattern was reversed (16% in Northern Europe and 6% in Eastern Europe). Lung cancer accounted for more than half of the total cancer burden attributable to smoking (382,000). Other major contributors to the total PAF were lip, oral cavity and pharynx, bladder and laryngeal cancers in men (27% out of total PAF) and colorectal, pancreatic, oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers (21%) in women. Conclusions: Tobacco smoking was responsible for one in five cancer cases in Europe in 2018.

Results: Advanced age, history of tobacco and alcohol abuse, and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are significant risk factors for the development of adverse respiratory outcomes. Treatment toxicities from radiation or chemoradiation therapy significantly increase these risks. Conclusion: Respiratory complications are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality among HNSCC patients, and the COVID-19 pandemic may disproportionately affect this population.

However, the generalizability of causal evidence between occupational exposures and cancer outcomes in military personnel is limited. This study aims to describe the epidemiology cause-specific cancer mortality in still serving and released Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel recruited between 1976 and 2012. Methods: Data came from the Canadian Forces Cancer and Mortality Study II (CF CAMS II), a record-linkage study of approximately 228,685 CAF Regular Force personnel and Reservists. Sex-stratified standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated for each neoplasm subcategory, with the Canadian general population (CGP) as the reference. Results: Approximately 1,450 deaths were attributable to neoplasms. Cancer mortality was lower in both men and women with military service (SMR = 0.77 and 0.78, respectively) versus CGP. Females had a significantly lower risk of breast cancer. Males in the cohort had a significantly lower risk of lip, oral cavity and pharynx, digestive organs, respiratory and intrathoracic organs, bone and articular cartilage, and mesothelial and soft-tissue cancers. However, males also had a significantly increased risk for neoplasms of the central nervous system and lymphoid cells, as well as for certain specific cancer diagnoses. Conclusions: Current and former CAF personnel were at comparable, or lower risk than, the CGP for cancer-related deaths. However, there was an increased risk for certain neoplasm subcategories and specific cancers.

4_h,health_belief,30383737,Does oral sex cause throat cancer?,oral sex causes throat cancer,1.0,"Problem/condition: Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of cancer, contributing to at least 12 types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx; esophagus; stomach; colon and rectum; liver; pancreas; larynx; lung, bronchus, and trachea; kidney and renal pelvis; urinary bladder; and cervix. This report provides a comprehensive assessment of recent tobacco-associated cancer incidence for each cancer type by sex, age, race/ethnicity, metropolitan county classification, tumor characteristics, U.S. census region, and state. These data are important for initiation, monitoring, and evaluation of tobacco prevention and control measures. Period covered: 2010-2014. Description of system: Cancer incidence data from CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program were used to calculate average annual age-adjusted incidence rates for 2010-2014 and trends in annual age-adjusted incidence rates for 2010-2014. These cancer incidence data cover approximately 99% of the U.S. Population: This report provides age-adjusted cancer incidence rates for each of the 12 cancer types known to be causally associated with tobacco use, including liver and colorectal cancer, which were deemed to be causally associated with tobacco use by the U.S. Surgeon General in 2014. Findings are reported by demographic and geographic characteristics, percentage distributions for tumor characteristics, and trends in cancer incidence by sex. Results: During 2010-2014, approximately 3.3 million new tobacco-associated cancer cases were reported in the United States, approximately 667,000 per year. Age-adjusted incidence rates ranged from 4.2 AML cases per 100,000 persons to 61.3 lung cancer cases per 100,000 persons. By cancer type, incidence rates were higher among men than women (excluding cervical cancer), higher among non-Hispanics than Hispanics (for all cancers except stomach, liver, kidney, and cervical), higher among persons in nonmetropolitan counties than those in metropolitan counties (for all cancers except stomach, liver, pancreatic, and AML), and lower in the West than in other U.S. census regions (all except stomach, liver, bladder, and AML). Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, certain cancer rates were highest among whites (oral cavity and pharyngeal, esophageal, bladder, and AML), blacks (colon and rectal, pancreatic, laryngeal, lung and bronchial, cervical, and kidney), and Asians/Pacific Islanders (stomach and liver). During 2010-2014, the rate of all tobacco-associated cancers combined decreased 1.2% per year, influenced largely by decreases in cancers of the larynx (3.0%), lung (2.2%), colon and rectum (2.1%), and bladder (1.3%). Interpretation: Although tobacco-associated cancer incidence decreased overall during 2010-2014, the incidence remains high in several states and subgroups, including among men, whites, blacks, non-Hispanics, and persons in nonmetropolitan counties. These disproportionately high rates of tobacco-related cancer incidence reflect overall demographic patterns of cancer incidence in the United States and also reflect patterns of tobacco use. Public health action: Tobacco-associated cancer incidence can be reduced through prevention and control of tobacco use and comprehensive cancer-control efforts focused on reducing cancer risk, detecting cancer early, and better assisting communities disproportionately affected by cancer. Ongoing surveillance to monitor cancer incidence can identify populations with a high incidence of tobacco-associated cancers and evaluate the effectiveness of tobacco control programs and policies. Implementation research can be conducted to achieve wider adoption of existing evidence-based cancer prevention and screening programs and tobacco control measures, especially to reach groups with the largest disparities in cancer rates.",0.0004997229552827775

We present a comprehensive picture of the patterns and time trends of the burden of total cancer and specific cancer types in each state of India estimated as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 because such a systematic compilation is not readily available. Methods: We used all accessible data from multiple sources, including 42 population-based cancer registries and the nationwide Sample Registration System of India, to estimate the incidence of 28 types of cancer in every state of India from 1990 to 2016 and the deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by them, as part of GBD 2016. We present incidence, DALYs, and death rates for all cancers together, and the trends of all types of cancers, highlighting the heterogeneity in the burden of specific types of cancers across the states of India. We also present the contribution of major risk factors to cancer DALYs in India. Findings: 8·3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 7·9-8·6) of the total deaths and 5·0% (4·6-5·5) of the total DALYs in India in 2016 were due to cancer, which was double the contribution of cancer in 1990. However, the age-standardised incidence rate of cancer did not change substantially during this period. The age-standardised cancer DALY rate had a 2·6 times variation across the states of India in 2016. The ten cancers responsible for the highest proportion of cancer DALYs in India in 2016 were stomach (9·0% of the total cancer DALYs), breast (8·2%), lung (7·5%), lip and oral cavity (7·2%), pharynx other than nasopharynx (6·8%), colon and rectum (5·8%), leukaemia (5·2%), cervical (5·2%), oesophageal (4·3%), and brain and nervous system (3·5%) cancer. Among these cancers, the age-standardised incidence rate of breast cancer increased significantly by 40·7% (95% UI 7·0-85·6) from 1990 to 2016, whereas it decreased for stomach (39·7%; 34·3-44·0), lip and oral cavity (6·4%; 0·4-18·6), cervical (39·7%; 26·5-57·3), and oesophageal cancer (31·2%; 27·9-34·9), and leukaemia (16·1%; 4·3-24·2). We found substantial inter-state heterogeneity in the age-standardised incidence rate of the different types of cancers in 2016, with a 3·3 times to 11·6 times variation for the four most frequent cancers (lip and oral, breast, lung, and stomach). Tobacco use was the leading risk factor for cancers in India to which the highest proportion (10·9%) of cancer DALYs could be attributed in 2016. Interpretation: The substantial heterogeneity in the state-level incidence rate and health loss trends of the different types of cancer in India over this 26-year period should be taken into account to strengthen infrastructure and human resources for cancer prevention and control at both the national and state levels. These efforts should focus on the ten cancers contributing the highest DALYs in India, including cancers of the stomach, lung, pharynx other than nasopharynx, colon and rectum, leukaemia, oesophageal, and brain and nervous system, in addition to breast, lip and oral cavity, and cervical cancer, which are currently the focus of screening and early detection programmes.

This is important because HPV status can have implications for treatment, prognosis, and future sexual decisions. Using a health literacy framework, this study explored how patients diagnosed with HPV-associated cancers accessed, understood, appraised, and applied HPV information. We conducted 27 in-depth interviews with patients seeking care at a comprehensive cancer center; and data were analyzed using applied thematic analysis. Findings revealed that patients' primary source of HPV information was medical providers (access); and many patients exhibited limited understanding of HPV and its role in their cancer diagnosis (understand). Most patients (17 of 27) did not mention HPV as the cause of their cancer. Many patients displayed difficulty connecting HPV with their lifestyles (appraise); and few discussed plans to engage in HPV prevention practices going forward (apply).

Methods: Incidence data were obtained from the CDC-funded and NCI-funded population-based cancer registry programs and compiled by NAACCR. Data on cancer deaths were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics National Vital Statistics System. Trends in age-standardized incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancer types by sex, race, and ethnicity were estimated by joinpoint analysis and expressed as the annual percent change. Stage distribution and 5-year survival by stage at diagnosis were calculated for breast cancer, colon and rectum (colorectal) cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, and melanoma of the skin. Results: Overall cancer incidence rates from 2008 to 2014 decreased by 2.2% per year among men but were stable among women. Overall cancer death rates from 1999 to 2015 decreased by 1.8% per year among men and by 1.4% per year among women. Among men, incidence rates during the most recent 5-year period (2010-2014) decreased for 7 of the 17 most common cancer types, and death rates (2011-2015) decreased for 11 of the 18 most common types. Among women, incidence rates declined for 7 of the 18 most common cancers, and death rates declined for 14 of the 20 most common cancers. Death rates decreased for cancer sites, including lung and bronchus (men and women), colorectal (men and women), female breast, and prostate. Death rates increased for cancers of the liver (men and women); pancreas (men and women); brain and other nervous system (men and women); oral cavity and pharynx (men only); soft tissue, including heart (men only); nonmelanoma skin (men only); and uterus. Incidence and death rates were higher among men than among women for all racial and ethnic groups. For all cancer sites combined, black men and white women had the highest incidence rates compared with other racial groups, and black men and black women had the highest death rates compared with other racial groups. Non-Hispanic men and women had higher incidence and mortality rates than those of Hispanic ethnicity. Five-year survival for cases diagnosed from 2007 through 2013 ranged from 100% (stage I) to 26.5% (stage IV) for female breast cancer, from 88.1% (stage I) to 12.6% (stage IV) for colorectal cancer, from 55.1% (stage I) to 4.2% (stage IV) for lung and bronchus cancer, and from 99.5% (stage I) to 16% (stage IV) for melanoma of the skin. Among children, overall cancer incidence rates increased by 0.8% per year from 2010 to 2014, and overall cancer death rates decreased by 1.5% per year from 2011 to 2015. Conclusions: For all cancer sites combined, cancer incidence rates decreased among men but were stable among women. Overall, there continue to be significant declines in cancer death rates among both men and women. Differences in rates and trends by race and ethnic group remain. Progress in reducing cancer mortality has not occurred for all sites.

While 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) serves as an excellent biomarker for NNK exposure, the currently available biomarker for NNN exposure is urinary ""total NNN"" (free NNN plus its N -glucuronide). Quantitation of urinary NNN requires extensive precautions to prevent artifactual formation of NNN resulting from nitrosation of nornicotine during analysis. NNN itself can also be formed endogenously by the same nitrosation reaction, which may sometimes cause an overestimation of exposure to preformed NNN. It is thus important to develop an alternative biomarker to specifically reflect NNN metabolic fate and facilitate relevant cancer etiology studies. In this study, we report the first detection of N '-nitrosonornicotine-1 N -oxide (NNN- N -oxide) in human urine. Using a highly specific and sensitive MS<sup>3</sup> transition-based method, NNN- N -oxide was quantified with a mean level of 8.40 ± 6.04 fmol/mL in the urine of 10 out of 32 cigarette smokers. It occurred in a substantially higher level in the urine of 13 out of 14 smokeless tobacco users, amounting to a mean concentration of 85.2 ± 96.3 fmol/mL urine. No NNN- N -oxide was detected in any of the nonsmoker urine samples analyzed ( n = 20). The possible artifactual formation of NNN- N -oxide during sample preparation steps was excluded by experiments using added ammonium sulfamate. The low levels of NNN- N -oxide in the urine of tobacco users indicate that the pyridine N -oxidation pathway represents a minor detoxification pathway of NNN, which further supports the importance of the α-hydroxylation pathway of NNN metabolic activation in humans.",0.9995712637901306

The report by Blot and colleagues represents a landmark in oropharyngeal cancer epidemiology. This study, the largest at the time, introduced several novel concepts in oropharyngeal cancer epidemiology that remain relevant today-etiologic heterogeneity, statistical interaction effects, adjusted attributable fractions, and disparities by sex and race/ethnicity. Perhaps the most significant recognition in the field since 1988 is the etiologic association of human papillomavirus (HPV, primarily HPV16) with cancers arising in the oropharynx. Today, more than 80% of oropharyngeal cancers in the United States are caused by HPV while only approximately 3% of oral cavity cancers are caused by HPV. This etiologic heterogeneity across head and cancer subsites revealed by HPV is manifest at the genetic/genomic, epidemiologic, and clinical levels. Tobacco and alcohol remain the major etiologic factors for oral cavity cancers while HPV is the major cause of oropharyngeal cancers. Thus, tobacco and alcohol control and prophylactic HPV vaccination remain the most promising prevention tools for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers at this time. Importantly, the ever-emerging alternative tobacco products, such as smokeless tobacco/snus, hookah and water pipes, e-cigarettes, flavored cigars and cigarillos, and oral dissolvable products, represent a key public health concern and the carcinogenic effects of these products remains an active area of investigation.

A plethora of smokeless tobacco products lead to unacceptable exposure to multiple carcinogens, including the tobacco-specific nitrosamine N'-nitrosonornicotine, a likely cause of the commonly occurring oral cavity cancers observed particularly in South-East Asian countries. Cigarettes continue to deliver a large number of carcinogens, including tobacco-specific nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds. The multiple carcinogens in cigarette smoke are responsible for the complex mutations observed in critical cancer genes. The exposure of smokeless tobacco users and smokers to carcinogens and toxicants can now be monitored by urinary and DNA adduct biomarkers that may be able to identify those individuals at highest risk of cancer so that effective cancer prevention interventions can be initiated. Regulation of the levels of carcinogens, toxicants and nicotine in tobacco products and evidence-based tobacco control efforts are now recognized as established pathways to preventing tobacco related cancer.",0.9993677735328674

Tobaccorelated deaths are associated with cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, oral potentially malignant disorders, cancer, others. Moreover there is also associated nicotine dependence which might result to numerous tobacco-associated diseases. Objective This study was conducted to analyze the degree of nicotine dependence considering its potential health risk, in the Eastern region of Nepal. Method A descriptive questionnaire based study was conducted among current tobacco users of six districts of Eastern Nepal. Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependency for Smokeless Tobacco (FTNDST) questionnaire were used for tobacco smokers and chewers, respectively. Result Of the total participants, 836 were males and 359 females, among whom 736 were active tobacco smokers and 432 chewers, 34.8% had tried to stop consuming tobacco and 306 (25.6%) had oral lesions in white or red forms. Very low nicotine dependence was found among 244 (31.47%) tobacco smokers and 37 (8.56%) chewers whereas 36 (4.71%) smokers and 103 (23.84%) chewers had very high nicotine dependence. The mean score for FTND was 3.73±2.37 and 5.74±2.12 for FTND-ST. A significant difference in duration and age group with FTND score was observed, however not with FTND-ST. Conclusion The information regarding degree of nicotine dependence can be used as baseline information for planning of preventive strategies and implementation of tobacco cessation and control programs.",0.9962993264198303

Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer and of death from cancer. Beedis are the most popular smoking form of tobacco in India. Thirty-four percent of the tobacco produced in India is used for making beedis. The beedi sector is agroforestry-based and the second largest industry in India with approximately 4.4 million full-time beedi workers in India. Toxic constituents present in tobacco are released into the ambient air during the processing of beedis. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to assess and compare salivary sialic acid levels among beedi rollers, tobacco smokers, smokeless tobacco users and individuals with no tobacco exposure. The study sample comprised of 140 individuals who were 30 to 60 years old, who attended dental screening and treatment camps in rural and urban areas in Mangalore, conducted by the Department of Public Health Dentistry, Yenepoya Dental College and patients who visited the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology of Yenepoya Dental College. Saliva was collected by passive drool method into a sterile container. Biochemical analysis of salivary sialic acid was done using the acidic ninhydrin method. Continuous variables are expressed in terms of mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables are expressed in terms of frequencies and percentages. To compare salivary sialic acid levels between the groups ANOVA was used. The Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables between the groups. Results: A total of 140 participants, 35 beedi rollers, 35 smokers, 35 smokeless tobacco users and 35 individuals with no tobacco exposure participated in the study. Among the 140 participants, 90 participants were males and 50 participants were females. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean salivary sialic acid level between the different groups (p 0.001) with smokeless tobacco users having the highest (10.60 mg/dL) mean salivary sialic acid level. It was found that the mean salivary sialic acid level reduced as the age progressed, even though there was no statistically significant difference. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean salivary sialic acid level between the different groups (p=0.010) with participants with 11 to 20 years of exposure to tobacco having the highest (8.67 mg/dL) mean salivary sialic acid level and participants with no tobacco exposure having least (3.06 mg/dL) mean salivary sialic acid level. Conclusion: The salivary sialic acid level was more in beedi rollers than individuals with no tobacco exposure, even though the difference was not statistically significant. The results showed elevated levels of salivary sialic acid in smokeless tobacco users followed by tobacco smokers. This may be an indication that smokeless tobacco use has harmful eﬀects similar to or more than tobacco smoking since salivary sialic acid levels in smokeless tobacco users were higher than those in smokers.",0.9480308294296265

However, the primary addictive substance in AN is not clearly understood. Objective: The present review evaluates possible addictive chemicals in AN with their mechanisms of action for progression to BQ dependence, as it is essential to overcome barriers in BQ cessation. It also identifies innovative treatment modalities in BQ cessation including the scope for research on pharmacotherapy using Monoamine-oxidase Inhibitors, Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors and Norepinephrine Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors. Methods: This is a narrative review on addictive properties of BQ and trials undertaken to promote cessation of SLT or AN use. Results: Twenty interventional studies, three by behavioral therapy and seventeen using pharmacotherapy were reviewed. There was heterogeneity in reported follow up times, most studies reporting data at 12 weeks with abstinence rates of 45-55% for SLT cessation and at 8 weeks with abstinence rates around 35% for AN cessation. Conclusion: Even though literature reveals a few cessation programs through behavioral support for BQ addiction, its success has been limited in certain instances mainly due to addictive properties of AN, resulting in withdrawal and relapse. Hence, in line with pharmacotherapy in tobacco smoking cessation, potential pharmacological agents to assist in cessation of SLT and AN require more attention. Several clinical trials for SLT cessation have been carried out with varying levels of success using Nicotine Replacement Therapy and Varenicline while trials on antidepressants for SLT and AN cessation are also emerging.",0.00033845470170490444

A correlation between tobacco use and local epithelial tissue damage exists. Yet, the underlying cellular mechanism is not precisely characterized. This study assessed the dose-dependent action of Smokeless tobacco extract on gingival epithelial cells. Gingival tissue was taken from 5 healthy donors. Gingival epithelial cells were isolated by an enzymatic method and cultured up to passage 2. The cultured cells were treated with smokeless tobacco extract at 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75% volume concentration. After 48 h of incubation, MTT assay, Annexin V/PI assay, and DiIC1(5) assay were used to evaluate viability, apoptosis, and mitochondrial potential of the cells. RT-qPCR was used to determine the expression of BAX, BCL2, ECAD, NCAD, and TWIST. The Smokeless tobacco extract reduced cell viability by disrupting the mitochondrial potential and inducing apoptosis. Further, the Smokeless tobacco extract induced a dose-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal-transition in gingival epithelial cells. Apoptotic cellular death caused by tobacco extract on the gingival epithelial system was dependant on the mitochondrial potential of the cell. The results demonstrate that smokeless tobacco causes detrimental metabolic alterations of the periodontium. Featured application: This study elucidates the mechanism by which Smokeless tobacco products cause cellular damage to the gingival epithelium. The use of Smokeless tobacco products can lead to major cellular and surface changes in the gingiva and its appearance. The consequences of these changes are not limited to oral cancer but also increases a person's risk for dental and periodontal disease.",0.30703580379486084

However, when patients are treated with contemporary standard-of-care antidepressant pharmacotherapies, a suboptimal response is often attained, resulting in frequent treatment changes. OBJECTIVE: To compare health care resource utilization (HCRU) and all-cause medical and pharmacy costs between commercially insured patients with an MDD diagnosis and matched non-MDD patients and explore treatment patterns among patients with MDD initiating antidepressant pharmacotherapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational analysis of IBM MarketScan US commercial claims data. Adults aged 18 years and older with continuous enrollment 12 or more months before and after the patient's first MDD diagnosis from 2017 to 2018 were included in the analysis. HCRU and all-cause medical and pharmacy costs were compared among patients with MDD and a 1:1 exact-matched cohort of non-MDD patients during the same period (Objective 1). Treatment patterns (persistence, discontinuation, switch, combination, and augmentation) were analyzed for patients with MDD starting first-line antidepressant monotherapy for up to 12 months following their antidepressant initiation index date (Objective 2). Time to first treatment change or discontinuation was calculated and treatment patterns were graphically displayed in Sankey diagrams. RESULTS: 625,272 patients with MDD were matched 1:1 to a cohort of non-MDD patients in Objective 1. Patients with MDD had statistically significantly greater all-cause medical (20.4 vs 9.4; P 0.0001), outpatient (19.5 vs 9.0; P 0.0001), emergency department (0.51 vs 0.23; P 0.0001), inpatient (0.35 vs 0.11; P 0.0001), and any mental health-related (7.7 vs 0.58; P 0.0001) visits compared with non-MDD patients. Mean all-cause medical costs were $6,809 ( P 0.0001) higher among patients with MDD than among patients without MDD ($13,183 vs $6,374, respectively). In Objective 2, 44,485 patients with MDD who received antidepressant monotherapy as their first-line MDD treatment were examined. Among the first treatment patterns observed following initiation, 19.3% of patients persisted with their first-line therapy, 56.2% discontinued antidepressant therapy, 24.5% experienced a treatment change (switching, adding a second antidepressant, or augmenting their existing therapy). The median days until first treatment change were 65 days for those discontinuing and 47 days for those switching antidepressants. Among the 24.5% of patients with a treatment change, 50.0% experienced another change in therapy within 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: The HCRU and costs accrued for patients with MDD is significantly greater than those for non-MDD patients. A large proportion of patients with MDD experienced treatment changes shortly after initiating their first-line antidepressant therapy. The results of this study highlight the need for reevaluation of the current MDD treatment paradigm. DISCLOSURES: Drs Zhu and Namjoshi are employees of Biogen Inc. and may hold stock.

It is 4th important cause of disability, poor quality of life, and economic burden. Women are more affected with the depression as compared to men and severe depression can lead to suicide. Most of the antidepressants predominantly work through the modulation on the availability of monoaminergic neurotransmitter (NTs) levels in the synapse. Current antidepressants have limited efficacy and tolerability. Moreover, treatment resistant depression (TRD) is one of the main causes for failure of standard marketed antidepressants. Recently, inflammation has also emerged as a crucial factor in pathological progression of depression. Proinflammatory cytokine levels are increased in depressive patients. Antidepressant treatment may attenuate depression via modulation of pathways of inflammation, transformation in structure of brain, and synaptic plasticity. Hence, targeting inflammation may be emerged as an effective approach for the treatment of depression. The present review article will focus on the preclinical and clinical studies that targets inflammation. In addition, it also concentrates on the therapeutic approaches' that targets depression via influence on the inflammatory signaling pathways.

Routine tests revealed a rare and potentially dangerous cause of her symptoms. Case presentation: The patient had a history of bipolar II disorder, recurrent depressive disorder and hypothyroidism, and presented to the psychiatric emergency department with a one-week history of delusions of persecutory character and increasing insomnia. She had given birth four months prior to admission. Clinical examination was otherwise unremarkable. Bipolar psychosis was considered the most likely diagnosis, and she was started on antipsychotic medication with quetiapine 100 mg × 2. Routine blood tests revealed severe hypothyroidism with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) of 151,00 mIU/L and free T4 (fT4) of 3,0 pmol/L (9,5-22,0), and the patient was treated with a high dose of oral levothyroxine. After a few days the patient's psychiatric symptoms resolved completely, and her fT4 increased to 10,8 pmol/L. Upon further questioning, the patient admitted to increasing fatigue and constantly feeling cold over the previous few months, which she attributed to being a parent.

Following the addition of boxed warnings to benzodiazepine and opioid products about increased respiratory depression risk with simultaneous use, the US Food and Drug Administration evaluated whether other drugs that might be used in place of benzodiazepines may cause similar effects. Objective: To study whether combining paroxetine or quetiapine with oxycodone, compared with oxycodone alone, decreases the ventilatory response to hypercapnia. Design, setting, and participants: Randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial at a clinical pharmacology unit (West Bend, Wisconsin) with 25 healthy participants from January 2021 through May 25, 2021. Interventions: Oxycodone 10 mg on days 1 and 5 and the following in a randomized order for 5 days: paroxetine 40 mg daily, quetiapine twice daily (increasing daily doses from 100 mg to 400 mg), or placebo. Main outcomes and measures: Ventilation at end-tidal carbon dioxide of 55 mm Hg (hypercapnic ventilation) using rebreathing methodology assessed for paroxetine or quetiapine with oxycodone, compared with placebo and oxycodone, on days 1 and 5 (primary) and for paroxetine or quetiapine alone compared with placebo on day 4 (secondary). Results: Among 25 participants (median age, 35 years [IQR, 30-40 years]; 11 female [44%]), 19 (76%) completed the trial. The mean hypercapnic ventilation was significantly decreased with paroxetine plus oxycodone vs placebo plus oxycodone on day 1 (29.2 vs 34.1 L/min; mean difference [MD], -4.9 L/min [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to -0.6]; P = .01) and day 5 (25.1 vs 35.3 L/min; MD, -10.2 L/min [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to -6.3]; P .001) but was not significantly decreased with quetiapine plus oxycodone vs placebo plus oxycodone on day 1 (33.0 vs 34.1 L/min; MD, -1.2 L/min [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 2.8]; P = .28) or on day 5 (34.7 vs 35.3 L/min; MD, -0.6 L/min [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 3.2]; P = .37). As a secondary outcome, mean hypercapnic ventilation was significantly decreased on day 4 with paroxetine alone vs placebo (32.4 vs 41.7 L/min; MD, -9.3 L/min [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to -3.9]; P .001), but not with quetiapine alone vs placebo (42.8 vs 41.7 L/min; MD, 1.1 L/min [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 6.4]; P = .67). No drug-related serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions and relevance: In this preliminary study involving healthy participants, paroxetine combined with oxycodone, compared with oxycodone alone, significantly decreased the ventilatory response to hypercapnia on days 1 and 5, whereas quetiapine combined with oxycodone did not cause such an effect.

6_h,health_belief,36207167,Does antidepressant cause depression?,antidepressant causes depression,1.0,"Purpose: This study aimed to characterize patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) initiating esketamine or conventional therapies. Methods: Adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) were selected from the IBM MarketScan Databases. A claims-based algorithm identified patients with evidence of TRD, defined as initiation of a new antidepressant therapy after 2 different antidepressant trials of adequate dose and duration during the most recent major depressive episode. Patients receiving treatment on/after March 5, 2019 (esketamine approval date for TRD), were classified to the esketamine cohort if they newly initiated esketamine (index date) or to the TRD conventional therapies cohorts if they newly initiated electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), or pharmacologic therapies (index date was the therapy initiation date, prioritizing ECT, then TMS, then pharmacologic antidepressant therapies). Patient characteristics in the 6 months before therapy initiation were described. Findings: The esketamine cohort included 246 patients (mean age, 46.5 years; 63.0% female), and the TRD conventional therapies cohorts included 104,164 patients (mean age, 46.9 years; 74.8% female; 0.4% initiated ECT, 1.2% initiated TMS). During the 6 months preindex, in the esketamine and TRD conventional therapies cohorts, 77.6% and 41.4% received psychotherapy and 82.9% and 34.2% had a psychiatrist visit, respectively. Most patients had outpatient care for MDD in the esketamine (91.9%) and TRD conventional therapies (63.6%) cohorts; 57.3% and 21.0% received care at specialized mental health care settings. MDD was classified as ""severe"" among 81.3% and 35.1% of patients in the esketamine and TRD conventional therapies cohorts . Preindex mental health-related (MHR) inpatient admissions and emergency department visits were identified in 12.2% and 16.3% of the esketamine cohort and in 8.2% and 10.3% of the TRD conventional therapies cohort. Before therapy initiation, 34.6% and 17.6% of the esketamine and TRD conventional therapies cohorts received ≥3 unique antidepressants. Suicidal ideation or behavior was observed in 8.5% and 3.6% of the esketamine and TRD conventional therapies cohorts pretherapy initiation. Mean monthly all-cause health care costs in the esketamine cohort were $2532 (58.2% MHR); in the TRD conventional therapies cohorts, costs were $1873 (32.4% MHR). Implications: Among patients with TRD, those initiating esketamine relative to conventional therapies displayed higher MDD severity, used more MHR inpatient/emergency department services and antidepressant treatments, and incurred higher health care costs 6 months pretherapy initiation. These findings suggest potential benefits of identifying and treating patients with TRD earlier with more effective treatments and should inform payers in consideration of esketamine coverage.

Materials and methods: This retrospective matched cohort study used data collected from the Optum electronic health record de-identified database for patients with diagnosis codes for MDD and acute suicidal ideation or behavior, and a propensity-score matched cohort of patients without MDD or a suicide-related event. The study period was 31/10/2015-30/9/2019. MDD-related treatments and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores, when available, were assessed at the first health care encounter for a suicide-related event (index period), 12 months before (pre-period), and 6 months after (post-period). All-cause and MDD-related HRU were assessed during the post-period. Results: The mean (SD) age of patients with MDSI was 39 (16) years; 55.0% were female. Index events occurred as follows: inpatient stay, 38.9%; observation unit stay, 4.6%; emergency department (ED) visit, 46.5%; and outpatient visit, 10.1%. Antidepressants and psychotherapy were the most common pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments, respectively, prescribed during the pre- (31.3%, 9.5%, respectively) and index (41.2%, 18.7%, respectively) periods. Post-period data (n = 40,261) revealed only 43.4% received an antidepressant and 20.5% had psychotherapy after the suicide-related event. Few patients had PHQ-9 scores recorded during the pre- (4.4%), index (1.3%), and post- (7.6%) periods. During the post-period, 11.8%, 5.0%, and 33.1% of patients had ≥1 all-cause inpatient stay, observation unit stay, and emergency department visit, respectively; 61.0% had ≥1 all-cause, and 33.4% ≥1 MDD-related, outpatient visit. Most patients with MDSI and an inpatient encounter or ED visit were discharged to home or self-care (65.4%). Odds of an all-cause hospital encounter during the post-period were higher for patients with, versus without MDSI (by 30.1, 33.5, and 33.9 times for inpatient stay, ED visit and observation unit stay, respectively).

Men and women have unique cardiovascular risk factors, and sex differences in depression as well as the efficacy of antidepressants are important to consider. We examined whether antidepressant use was associated with risk of having a myocardial infarction (MI), and whether this association was sex-specific. Methods: Data from the HUNT study were used, gathered from a population in Norway (N = 31 765), collected from 1995 to 2008. These data were combined with the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry and the Norwegian Prescription Database. We performed logistic regression models to examine the association of antidepressant use on risk of having a fatal or non-fatal MI, adjusting for depression, anxiety, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, waist-hip ratio, smoking, age, and sex. Results are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals in parentheses. Results: The results indicated that antidepressant use was associated with a reduced risk of having MI at a later date (OR = 0.49 [0.38, 0.64]). Although this association was somewhat stronger for women (OR = 0.46 [0.31, 0.68]) compared to men (OR = 0.53 [0.37, 0.75]), analysis did not identify a sex-specific association of antidepressant use on MI. Follow-up analyses on different sub-types of antidepressants, showed that both SSRI and TCA were associated with reduced risk of MI. Conclusions: In this population study, the use of antidepressants was associated with a reduced risk of MI. This association was stronger for women, though we detected no interaction between sex and antidepressant use in terms of reduced risk of MI. Although limitations apply regarding causality, especially concerning a dose-response relationship, the results suggest that antidepressant use might reduce the risk of MI among both men and women.",0.0004920102073810995

Objective: This study aimed to examine the impact of a telepsychiatric care platform on changes in SI over time and remission, as well as to investigate the relationship between various demographic and medical factors on SI and SI remission. Methods: Participants included 8581 US-based adults (8366 in the treatment group and 215 in the control group) seeking treatment for depression, anxiety, or both. The treatment group included patients who had completed at least 12 weeks of treatment and had received a prescription for at least one psychiatric medication during the study period. Providers prescribed psychiatric medications for each patient during their first session and received regular data on participants. They also received decision support at treatment onset via the digital platform, which leveraged an empirically derived proprietary precision-prescribing algorithm to give providers real-time care guidelines. Participants in the control group consisted of individuals who completed the initial enrollment data and completed surveys at baseline and 12 weeks but did not receive care. Results: Greater feelings of hopelessness, anhedonia, and feeling bad about oneself were most significantly correlated (r=0.24-0.37) with SI at baseline. Sleep issues and feeling tired or having low energy, although significant, had lower correlations with SI (r=0.13-0.14). In terms of demographic variables, advancing age and education were associated with less SI at baseline (r=-0.16) and 12 weeks (r=-0.10) but less improvement over time (r=-0.12 and -0.11, respectively). Although not different at baseline, the SI expression was evident in 34.4% (74/215) of the participants in the control group and 12.32% (1031/8366) of the participants in the treatment group at 12 weeks. Although the participants in the treatment group improved over time regardless of various demographic variables, participants in the control group with less education worsened over time, after controlling for age and depression severity. A model incorporating the treatment group, age, sex, and 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores was 77% accurate in its classification of complete remission. Those in the treatment group were 4.3 times more likely (odds ratio 4.31, 95% CI 2.88-6.44) to have complete SI remission than those in the control group. Female participants and those with advanced education beyond high school were approximately 1.4 times more likely (odds ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.62) to remit than their counterparts.

Both patients stated that they did not want to change the current antidepressant treatment. Modafinil 100 mg/day was prescribed to the patients for daytime sleepiness. One month after the initiation of modafinil 100 mg/day in the 39-yearold patient, there was a marked decrease in the complaints of loss of sexual desire, decreased sexual arousal and orgasm difficulties. In the other patient, 43 years old, a slight improvement in sexual functions was observed after the initiation of modafinil. In this case, after the modafinil dose was increased to 200 mg/day, there was a significant improvement in sexual dysfunctions. In both cases, the improvement in sexual dysfunctions and possible mechanisms as a result of the addition of modafinil to the treatment will be discussed.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the response of patchouli to p-HBA remains unclear. In this study, RNA-sequencing combined with physiological analysis was used to monitor the dynamic transcriptomic and physiological changes in patchouli seedlings 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 h after p-HBA treatment. p-HBA stress inhibited root biomass accumulation, induced excessive hydrogen peroxide accumulation and lipid peroxidation, and activated most antioxidant enzymes. Compared with that of the control, the osmotic adjustment substance content was elevated with treatment. Subsequently, 15,532, 8,217, 8,946, 2,489, and 5,843 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 h after p-HBA treatment, respectively, were identified in patchouli roots. GO functional enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched mainly in plasma membrane, defense response, response to chitin, DNA-binding transcription factor activity and abscisic acid-activated signaling pathway. The upregulated genes were involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and linoleic acid metabolism. Genes associated with MAPK signaling pathway-plant, plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction were downregulated with p-HBA treatment. These pathways are related to root browning and rotting, leading to plant death.",0.9997126460075378

There has been widespread implementation and provision of eHealth interventions in the workplace as an inexpensive and anonymous way of addressing common mental disorders. Objective: This updated review aimed to synthesize the literature on the efficacy of eHealth interventions for anxiety, depression, and stress outcomes in employee samples in organizational settings and evaluate whether their effectiveness has improved over time. Methods: Systematic searches of relevant articles published from 2004 to July 2020 of eHealth intervention trials (app- or web-based) focusing on the mental health of employees were conducted. The quality and bias of all studies were assessed. We extracted means and SDs from publications by comparing the differences in effect sizes (Hedge g) in standardized mental health outcomes. We meta-analyzed these data using a random-effects model. Results: We identified a tripling of the body of evidence, with 75 trials available for meta-analysis from a combined sample of 14,747 articles. eHealth interventions showed small positive effects for anxiety (Hedges g=0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.39; P .001), depression (Hedges g=0.26, 95% CI 0.19-0.34; P .001), and stress (Hedges g=0.25, 95% CI 0.17-0.34; P .001) in employees' after intervention, with similar effects seen at the medium-term follow-up. However, there was evidence of no increase in the effectiveness of these interventions over the past decade. Conclusions: This review and meta-analysis confirmed that eHealth interventions have a small positive impact on reducing mental health symptoms in employees. Disappointingly, we found no evidence that, despite the advances in technology and the enormous resources in time, research, and finance devoted to this area for over a decade, better interventions are being produced. Hopefully, these small effect sizes do not represent optimum outcomes in organizational settings.

They have been shown to be effective in teaching procedural skills, medical knowledge, and clinical decision-making. Recently, virtual and augmented reality simulators are being produced, but there is no research on whether these more realistic experiences cause problematic and greater stress responses as compared to standard manikin simulators. Objective: The purpose of this research is to examine the psychological and physiological effects of augmented reality (AR) in medical simulation training as compared to traditional manikin simulations. Methods: A within-subjects experimental design was used to assess the responses of medical students (N=89) as they completed simulated (using either manikin or AR) pediatric resuscitations. Baseline measures of psychological well-being, salivary cortisol, and galvanic skin response (GSR) were taken before the simulations began. Continuous GSR assessments throughout and after the simulations were captured along with follow-up measures of emotion and cortisol. Participants also wrote freely about their experience with each simulation, and narratives were coded for emotional word use. Results: Of the total 86 medical students who participated, 37 (43%) were male and 49 (57%) were female, with a mean age of 25.2 (SD 2.09, range 22-30) years and 24.7 (SD 2.08, range 23-36) years, respectively. GSR was higher in the manikin group adjusted for day, sex, and medications taken by the participants (AR-manikin: -0.11, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.03; P=.009). The difference in negative affect between simulation types was not statistically significant (AR-manikin: 0.41, 95% CI -0.72 to 1.53; P=.48). There was no statistically significant difference between simulation types in self-reported stress (AR-manikin: 0.53, 95% CI -2.35 to 3.42; P=.71) or simulation stress (AR-manikin: -2.17, 95% CI -6.94 to 2.59; P=.37). The difference in percentage of positive emotion words used to describe the experience was not statistically significant between simulation types, which were adjusted for day of experiment, sex of the participants, and total number of words used (AR-manikin: -4.0, 95% CI -0.91 to 0.10; P=.12). There was no statistically significant difference between simulation types in terms of the percentage of negative emotion words used to describe the experience (AR-manikin: -0.33, 95% CI -1.12 to 0.46; P=.41), simulation sickness (AR-manikin: 0.17, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.62; P=.47), or salivary cortisol (AR-manikin: 0.04, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.13; P=.41). Finally, preexisting levels of posttraumatic stress disorder, perceived stress, and reported depression were not tied to physiological responses to AR. Conclusions: AR simulators elicited similar stress responses to currently used manikin-based simulators, and we did not find any evidence of AR simulators causing excessive stress to participants. Therefore, AR simulators are a promising tool to be used in medical training, which can provide more emotionally realistic scenarios without the risk of additional harm.",0.0018952992977574468

Workplace interventions aimed at supporting employers in the prevention of mental ill-health in the workforce are urgently required. Managing Minds at Work is a digital intervention aimed at supporting line managers in promoting better mental health at work through a preventative approach. This intervention was developed as part of the Mental Health and Productivity Pilot, a wider initiative aimed at supporting employers across the Midlands region of the United Kingdom to improve the future of workplace mental health and wellbeing. The aim of the study is to describe the design and development of the Managing Minds at Work digital training program, prior to feasibility testing. We adopted a collaborative participatory design involving co-design (users as partners) and principles of user-centred design (pilot and usability testing). An agile methodology was used to co-create intervention content with a stakeholder virtual community of practice. Development processes were mapped to core elements of the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions. The program covers five broad areas: (i) promoting self-care techniques among line managers; (ii) designing work to prevent work-related stress; (iii) management competencies to prevent and reduce stress; (iv) having conversations with employees about mental health; (v) building a psychologically safe work environment. It was considered by stakeholders to be appropriate for any type of organization, irrespective of their size or resources. Pilot and usability testing ( n = 37 surveys) aligned with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) demonstrated that the program was perceived to be useful, relevant, and easy to use by managers across sectors, organization types, and sizes.

The aim of this study was to describe the effect of simulated dives on the antioxidant system, HSPs, and nitric oxide synthase response and demonste the relationship between the concentration of HSPs and the intensification of oxidative stress. A total of 20 healthy professional divers took part in training, consisting of simulated dry dives in a hyperbaric chamber and split into experiment I (30 m exposure, 400 kPa) and experiment II (60 m exposure, 700 kPa) over 24 h. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), endothelial (eNOS) and inducible (iNOS) nitric oxide synthase were measured. Increases in the activity of SOD and MDA concentration were demonstrated. The activity of GPx depended on the dive profile. The HSP70 serum level in both experiments was significantly lower after the dives. The mean HSP90 level was significantly higher after the simulated dive at 60 m. A significant relationship between HSP concentration and SOD/GPx activity was demonstrated. eNOS concentration increased after 60 m exposure. No change in iNOS concentration was observed. In conclusions, the simulated dive significantly affected the antioxidant system, heat shock protein expression and nitric oxide synthase; however, the changes depend on the diving conditions.

7_h,health_belief,35484070,Does stress cause sickness?,stress causes sickness,1.0,"Introduction: Repeated exposure to challenging or traumatic situations can lead to a phenomenon called compassion fatigue (CF). This can present as increased stress and anxiety in staff and a reduced patient relationship. If untreated it can lead to sickness and attrition from the profession. This systematic review aims to investigate the evidence of stressors leading to CF in diagnostic radiographers. Method: A review protocol was developed and registered on PROSPERO. Database and grey literature searches were carried out. Studies were selected against pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria for review. No meta-analysis was possible therefore the data were presented as a narrative. Results: Fifteen studies were selected for review published between 1982 and 2020. Evidence demonstrates that diagnostic radiographers suffer from high levels of occupational stress, however, stress is perceived rather than defined. Common causes of occupational stress were identified as poor patient interactions and a lack of time to spend with patients. There is a lack of evidence to show how this stress affects radiographer health or their ability to provide compassionate care. Conclusion: Diagnostic radiographers are prone to suffering from symptoms that can be attributed to CF. This has been present for an extended period, and the main changes have been a decrease in job satisfaction and accomplishment. Patient interaction was identified as a cause, but it is unclear if this affects staff ability to be compassionate. Further work is required to find ways to mitigate these effects and prevent continued deterioration. Implications for practice: This review has highlighted that the issue of CF may be getting worse for some radiographers and that work is required to design and implement workable interventions to try and mitigate these issues.",0.9996223449707031

Methods: The authors examined the direct and indirect costs attributable to low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour in Finland in 2017. Costs related to major non-communicable diseases drawn from Finnish registries covered direct costs (outpatient visits, days of inpatient care, medication and institutional eldercare) and indirect costs (sickness-related absences, disability pensions, unemployment benefits, all-cause mortality and losses of income tax revenue). Prevalences of low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour (≥8 hours per 16 waking hours) were based on self-reports among adolescents or accelerometer data among adults and the elderly from three Finnish population studies: FINFIT 2017, Health 2011 and the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. Cost calculations used adjusted population attributable fractions (PAF) and regression models. Total annual costs were obtained by multiplying PAF by the total costs of the given disease. Results: The total costs of low physical activity in Finland in 2017 came to approximately €3.2 billion, of which direct costs accounted for €683 million and indirect ones for €2.5 billion. Costs attributable to high sedentary behaviour totalled roughly €1.5 billion. Conclusion: The findings suggest that low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour levels create substantial societal costs. Therefore, actions intended to increase physical activity and reduce excessive sedentary behaviour throughout life may yield not only better health but also considerable savings to society.",0.999148964881897

Methods: Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to be raised on the plains (the plains group, n = 20), at an altitude of 4 000 m (the plateau model group Ⅰ, n = 20), or at an altitude of 6 000 m (the plateau model group Ⅱ, n = 20) for a spermatogenic cycle of 14 days. After establishment of the model of high-altitude reproductive system injury, the testis tissues of the rats were harvested for HE staining and observed for histopathological changes under the light microscope, and their epididymedes collected for preparation of sperm suspension and detection of sperm motility, sperm count and the percentage of morphologically abnormal sperm (MAS). The blood gas level and oxidative stress-related indexes in different groups were also measured using the serological test. Results: With the elevation of altitude, the levels of pH and PO2 were decreased, those of PCO2, Hct, K+, Cl－ and Hb increased markedly, while that of Na+ exhibited no significant change. The model rats also showed folded spermatogenic tubule walls, thinned spermatogenic epithelia, disorderly arranged and reduced number of spermatogenic cells, and increased vascuolization in the spermatogenic epithelia, with decreased sperm motility and count, increased percentage of MAS, elevated concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Conclusions: A model of reproductive system injury was successfully established in male rats at a simulated altitude of 4 000 m.

Topical agents and synthetic drugs used for dandruff treatment have specific side effects including burning at the application site, depression, dizziness, headache, itching or skin rash, nausea, stomach pain, vision change, vomiting, discoloration of hair, dryness or oiliness of the scalp and increased loss of hair. Thus, essential oils and extracts from plants could be valuable in the treatment and prevention of dandruff. Aims &amp; objectives: This review aims to highlight current findings in dandruff occurrence, its etiology, promising plant essential oils/extracts, and novel treatment strategies. The main emphasis has been given on the anti-dandruff effect of essential oils and plant extracts to disrupt microbial growth. The proposed mechanism(s) of action, novel approaches used to perk up its biopharmaceutical properties, and topical application have been discussed. Results: The literature survey was done, and bibliographic sources and research papers were retrieved from different search engines and databases, including SciFinder, PubMed, NCBI, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The selection of papers was accomplished based on exclusion and inclusion criteria. The scalp of diverse populations revealed an association of dandruff with microbial symbiosis, including Staphylococcus, Propionibacterium, Malassezia, and Candida as the pathogens responsible for the cause of dandruff. Topical antifungals are considered the first line of treatment for dandruff including azoles, with clotrimazole (1%), ketoconazole (2%), and miconazole (2%). Other commonly used therapies integrate benzoyl peroxide, coal tar, glycerin, zinc pyrithione, lithium succinate/gluconate, salicylic acid, selenium disulfide/sulfide, sodium sulfacetamide, etc. However, these medicaments and chemicals are known to cause specific side effects. Alternative therapies, including tea tree oil, thyme, Aloe vera, Mentha have been reported to demonstrate anti-dandruff activity by disrupting the microbial growth associated with dandruff formation.

Numerous studies have reported impaired health sequelae after COVID-19 recovery, one of which is hair loss. Individuals with hair loss experience a substantial mental burden, which potentially hinders their social life. However, few studies have systematically analyzed the details including hair loss. Therefore, we conducted a narrative review using PubMed on the frequency, associated comorbidities, disease characteristics, and treatment of hair loss after SARS-CoV-2 infection (HLASCI). Two search strings were used to identify 28 articles. Of note, most of the literature identified on COVID-19 sequelae reported an emergence/occurrence of hair loss. HLASCI is speculated to be composed of a heterogeneous population, with the onset or exacerbation of telogen effluvium (TE), anagen effluvium, androgenetic alopecia (AGA), and alopecia areata (AA) reported as possible underlying mechanisms. Among these, acute TE is thought to be the primary cause of HLASCI, with COVID-19 treatment and TE improvement being considered crucial for HLASCI management. An association between COVID-19 and AA exacerbation has also been implicated with still insufficient evidence. Spontaneous recovery of TE can be expected once infection reduces; however, faster improvement in symptoms is expected to reduce the mental and social burden of patients. An additional search string identified 11 articles about TE treatment which suggested that the use of minoxidil may be beneficial.

Common anti-hair loss drugs carry some side effects; therefore, novel, safer approaches targeting milder phenotypes are highly advocated. In this context, we investigated an extract of the alpine plant Edelweiss, Leontopodium alpinum var. Helvetia, for its ability to modulate hair follicle (HF) growth ex vivo and inhibit hair loss while increasing hair regeneration in vivo. Methods: Human amputated HFs were microdissected from three donors, two women and one man, and cultured ex vivo for 6 days. After treatment with 0.001% Edelweiss extract (EWDE), we investigated hair shaft production and anagen/catagen conversion, and measured known parameters associated with hair growth, that is hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis, dermal papilla inductivity, and growth factors, by quantitative (immuno)histomorphometry. To assess the anti-hair loss potential of the alpine plant compound, we performed a randomized, placebo-controlled human study enrolling Caucasian women and men, aged 18 to 65 years, with normal hair loss. After 5 months' daily use of an extract containing leave-on serum, we analysed hair density and anagen-to-catagen/telogen ratio by the Trichogram analysis. Results: Our results revealed a significant prolongation in the anagen phase in HFs treated with 0.001% Edelweiss, as indicated by an increase in HFs remaining in anagen and a significant decrease in hair cycle score. In line with this effect, EWDE significantly stimulated hair matrix (HM) keratinocyte proliferation, and dermal papilla inductivity, as shown by a significant up-regulation of versican expression and alkaline phosphatase activity, and a tendential increase in FGF7 immunoreactivity in the dermal papilla of all HFs or only anagen VI HFs. Corroborating the ex vivo results, we observed a significant increase in growing hair shaft numbers (hair density) after treatment with Edelweiss extract formulation, and a tendential up-regulation in the anagen-to-catagen/telogen ratio. Conclusions: We show here, through several lines of evidence, that the selected extract of the alpine plant Leontopodium alpinum var Helvetia (Edelweiss) inhibits premature catagen induction, possibly by stimulating dermal papilla inductivity. It is therefore worth exploiting this extract clinically as an anti-hair loss agent, both for preventing ageing-associated hair shedding and as an adjuvant therapy for hair loss disorders.",0.7535428404808044

Recent human studies/reports have shown that use of some systemic JAK inhibitors led to hair regrowth, suggesting this medication class as a potential therapy for AA. However, topical treatment is desirable due to potential systemic side effects. To assess the efficacy and safety of topical delgocitinib in AA, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled clinical trial in 31 moderate-to-severe AA patients that were randomized 2:1 to receive delgocitinib ointment 30 mg/g (n = 20) or ointment vehicle (n = 11) for 12 weeks.

Links between AA and common mental health, autoimmune and atopic conditions, and common infections have previously been described but remain incompletely elucidated and contemporary descriptions of the epidemiology of AA in the UK are lacking. Methods and analysis: Retrospective study series using a large population-based cohort (5.2 million) from the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) database, exploring four themes: AA epidemiology, mental health comorbidities, autoimmune/atopic associations and common infections.In the epidemiology theme, we will describe the incidence and point prevalence of AA overall and by age, sex and sociodemographic factors. Healthcare utilisation (primary care visits and secondary care referrals) and treatments for AA will also be assessed. In the mental health theme, we will explore the prevalence and incidence of mental health conditions (anxiety, depressive episodes, recurrent depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, agoraphobia, self-harm and parasuicide) in people with AA compared with matched controls. We will also explore the mental health treatment patterns (medication and psychological interventions), time off work and unemployment rates. Within the autoimmune/atopic associations theme, we will examine the prevalence of atopic (atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma) and autoimmune conditions (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, coeliac disease, type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polymyalgia rheumatica, Sjögren's syndrome, psoriasis, vitiligo, multiple sclerosis, pernicious anaemia) in people with AA compared with matched controls. We will also estimate the incidence of new-onset atopic and autoimmune conditions after AA diagnosis. Within the common infections theme, we will examine the incidence of common infections (respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, acute bronchitis, influenza, skin infection, urinary tract infection, genital infections, gastrointestinal infection, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, meningitis, COVID-19) in people with AA compared with matched controls.

8_h,health_belief,34279913,Does medication cause hair loss?,medication causes hair loss,1.0,"Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is highly prevalent in current society but lacks effective treatments. The dysregulation of the hair follicle niche induced by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and insufficient vascularization in the perifollicular microenvironment is the leading cause of AGA. Herein, we designed a ceria nanozyme (CeNZ)-integrated microneedles patch (Ce-MNs) that can alleviate oxidative stress and promote angiogenesis simultaneously to reshape the perifollicular microenvironment for AGA treatment. On the basis of the excellent mechanical strength of Ce-MNs, the encapsulated CeNZs with catalase- and superoxide-mimic activities can be efficiently delivered into skin to scavenge excessive ROS. Moreover, the mechanical stimulation induced by the administration of MNs can remodel the microvasculature in the balding region. Compared with minoxidil, a widely used clinical drug for AGA treatment, Ce-MNs exhibited accelerated hair regeneration in the AGA mouse model at a lower administration frequency without inducing significant skin damage. Consequently, such a safe and perifollicular microenvironment-shaping MNs patch shows great potential for clinical AGA treatment.",0.0007268302724696696
8_h,health_belief,34125714,Does medication cause hair loss?,medication causes hair loss,1.0,"Topical minoxidil is a common medication prescribed for treating hair loss-related problems. Currently a wide range of minoxidil concentrations (2% to 15%) have been prescribed for the topical treatment of hair loss, but the majority of minoxidil solutions contain potential skin irritating inactive ingredients such as propylene glycol and high amounts of alcohol that may cause undesirable side effects. In order to minimize these side effects, FOAMIL, a propylene glycol-free and alcohol-reduced foam vehicle, was developed to compound minoxidil solutions of varying dosages. Since long-term use of this drug is necessary to maintain the clinical results, the objective of this study was to conduct a 180-day bracketed validated stability-indicating study of four compounded minoxidil solutions (2%, 5.5%, 6%, 15%) in FOAMIL. The samples were prepared by mixing the minoxidil with an appropriate amount of FOAMIL without any heating or filtration process. The obtained preparations were packaged into 100-mL foamer bottles before sending out for physicochemical analyses at pre-determined time points (days; 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180) and antimicrobial effectiveness testing to thirdparty independent analytical laboratories. Our results showed that the strength of all minoxidil solutions remained within the United States Pharmacopeia specification (90% to 110%) for 180 days. There were no significant changes in pH measurements and physical stability (color, odor, precipitation). Antimicrobial effectiveness of the preservative system also met the United States Pharmacopeia requirements at the end of the 180-day stability study for all concentrations. Based on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's guidance on bracketed study design, the findings of this study show that any concentration of minoxidil at or between 2% to 5.5% and 6% to 15% in FOAMIL can be considered stable for at least 180 days when stored at ambient condition.",0.9549716114997864

8_h,health_belief,33622323,Does medication cause hair loss?,medication causes hair loss,1.0,"Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multi-organ inflammatory autoimmune disease; immune complexes are part of the pathogenesis, but not entirely responsible. Trisomy X is the most common female chromosomal abnormality and the role of an additional X chromosome in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus is well recognized. However, the potential complications and optimal management of childhood lupus with trisomy X remain unclear. Herein, we describe a case of childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus associated with severe bone complications presumably secondary to trisomy X. Case presentation: A 16-year-old Japanese girl was diagnosed with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus and trisomy X. A chromosomal abnormality (47, XXX) was incidentally identified on bone marrow examination initially done to determine the cause of pancytopenia. She had a persistent headache, fever for six days, diffuse hair loss, mucosal ulcers, butterfly eruptions, and palmar erythema. Furthermore, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and erythrocyte fragmentation were detected, suggesting secondary thrombotic microangiopathy. She was initially treated with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy and prescribed monthly cyclophosphamide for severe disease activity, prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, and hydroxychloroquine as remission maintenance drugs. She developed generalized extremity pain that had been worsening throughout the disease. Extremity magnetic resonance imaging performed 12 months after the treatment onset revealed multifocal avascular necrosis, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry revealed further decreased bone mineral density. High plasma levels of factor VIII were detected by additional tests for coagulation functions, and we suspected the possibility that factor VIII might cause avascular necrosis due to thrombosis. Currently, she is being treated with prednisolone and MMF for SLE. However, her extremity pain has not been managed effectively even under the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and pregabalin. Conclusions: An additional X chromosome has been reported to be associated with factor VIII and osteoporosis. Additionally, elevated plasma levels of FVIII is the risk factors for thrombosis, which leads to the risk of avascular necrosis. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus complicated by trisomy X might be at a higher risk of avascular necrosis and osteoporosis that can also manifest in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus.",0.9997978806495667

The aim of this study was to document the role of diet, body mass index (BMI), premenstrual flare, and family history of acne as risk factors and cause of severity of AFA. Methods: This was a prospective, cross-sectional, case-control study of 112 women age ≥25 years. The women were clinically evaluated. Sociodemographic data (age, family history of acne, premenstrual flare, weight, and height) and dietary habits were documented. Age, weight, height, and dietary habits of controls were also documented. Data were analyzed using SPSS, version 22. Results: The mean age of the 56 patients with AFA was 33.4 ± 8.2 years (controls: 24.5 ± 4.4 years). Premenstrual flare of acne was noted in 58.9% of patients, a family history of acne was present in 51.8% of patients, and the mean BMI was 25.2 ± 4.9 (32.1%). A risk factor for AFA was a family history of acne ( p ≤ 0.001). Dietary habits (chicken, p = 0.457; beef, p = 0.845; cakes and sweets, p = 0.956; starchy food, p = 0.361; and type of milk, p = 0.919) and BMI ( p = 0.486) were not risk factors for AFA. Premenstrual flare ( p = 0.178), BMI ( p = 0.206), family history of acne ( p = 0.592), and diet did not contribute to the severity of AFA.

The current study aimed to investigate the prevalence of NS use in Chinese college students and its association with inflammatory skin diseases. Methods: This was a university-based epidemiologic investigation that included 20,138 students who underwent dermatological examinations. A questionnaire survey was conducted to inquire about the use of NS along with related information. Skin diseases were diagnosed by dermatologists during the health examination. Logistic regression models were used for analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were presented as the effect size. Results: Survey responses from a total of 20,138 participants were analyzed. Specifically, 18.3% of the participants reported the use of NS in the past year. The use of vitamin C was most frequently reported, accounting for a proportion of 12.9%, followed by vitamin B and mineral supplements. The use of NS was found to be associated with female sex, Han ethnicity, higher annual household income, and a series of healthy lifestyles such as more physical activity, less second-hand smoke exposure, less alcohol consumption, and higher intake of milk and yogurt ( p 0.001). Participants with chronic urticaria (aOR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7), atopic dermatitis (aOR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6), or acne (aOR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.31) were more likely to use NS, especially herbs (aOR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.2-3.7), followed by vitamin B (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0) and mineral supplements (aOR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-2.0).

Recent epidemiological studies associate the intake of cow's milk with an increased risk of diseases, which are associated with overactivated mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. This review presents current epidemiological and translational evidence linking milk consumption to the regulation of mTORC1, the master-switch for eukaryotic cell growth. Epidemiological studies confirm a correlation between cow's milk consumption and birthweight, body mass index, onset of menarche, linear growth during childhood, acne vulgaris, type 2 diabetes mellitus, prostate cancer, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, neurodegenerative diseases, and all-cause mortality. Thus, long-term persistent consumption of cow's milk increases the risk of mTORC1-driven diseases of civilization. Milk is a highly conserved, lactation genome-controlled signaling system that functions as a maternal-neonatal relay for optimized species-specific activation of mTORC1, the nexus for regulation of eukaryotic cell growth, and control of autophagy. A deeper understanding of milk´s impact on mTORC1 signaling is of critical importance for the prevention of common diseases of civilization.",0.9806846976280212

Given that the internet has become a major source of health information, especially among the young, the internet is a powerful tool of communication and has a significant influence on patients. Objective: This study aimed to clarify the features of patients' interest in and evaluate the quality of information about acne vulgaris on the internet. Methods: We compared the search volumes on acne vulgaris with those of other dermatological diseases using Google Trends from January 2004 to August 2019. We also determined the search volumes for relevant keywords of acne vulgaris on Google and Naver and evaluated the quality of answers to the queries in KnowledgeiN. Results: The regression analysis of Google Trends data demonstrated that the patients' interest in acne vulgaris was higher than that for other dermatological diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (β=-20.33, 95% CI -22.27 to -18.39, P .001) and urticaria (β=-27.09, 95% CI -29.03 to -25.15, P .001) and has increased yearly (β=2.38, 95% CI 2.05 to 2.71, P .001). The search volume for acne vulgaris was significantly higher in the summer than in the spring (β=-5.04, 95% CI -9.21 to -0.88, P=.018) and on weekends than on weekdays (β=-6.68, 95% CI -13.18 to -0.18, P=.044). The most frequently searched relevant keywords with ""acne vulgaris"" and ""cause"" were ""stress,"" ""food,"" and ""cosmetics.""

Lesions associated with high-dose vitamin B6 and B12 supplements have been described as monomorphic and although pathogenesis is unknown, a number of hypotheses have been proposed. Iodine-related acne may be related to the use of kelp supplements and has been reported as monomorphic, inflammatory pustules on the face and upper trunk. Whey protein supplements, derived from milk and used for bodybuilding, are associated with papulonodular acne involving the trunk and sometimes the face. Finally, AAS-induced acne has been described as acne fulminans, acne conglobata, and acne papulopustulosa.

For a long time, people have believed that increasing milk intake is beneficial to increasing bone density. Many confounding factors can affect milk consumption, and thus the association described to date may not be causal. We explored the causal relationship between genetically predicted milk consumption and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) of the femoral neck and lumbar spine based on 53,236 individuals from 27 studies of European ancestry using the Mendelian randomization (MR) study. 32,961 individuals of European and East Asian ancestry were used for sensitivity analysis. Methods: A genetic instrument used for evaluating milk consumption is rs4988235, a locus located at 13,910 base pairs upstream of the LCT gene. A Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to study the effect of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and BMD. The summary-level data for BMD of the femoral neck and lumbar spine were obtained from two GWAS meta-analyses ['Data Release 2012' and 'Data Release 2015' in the GEnetic Factors for OSteoporosis Consortium (GEFOS)]. Results: we found that genetically predicted milk consumption was not associated with FN-BMD(OR 1.007; 95% CI 0.991-1.023; P = 0.385), LS-BMD(OR 1.003; 95% CI 0.983-1.024; P = 0.743) by performing a meta-analysis of several different cohort studies. High levels of genetically predicted milk intake were positively associated with increased FN-BMD in Women. The OR for each additional milk intake increasing allele was 1.032 (95%CI 1.005-1.059; P = 0.014).

This review aims to describe changes in mineral metabolism during pregnancy and lactation as well as their clinical impact. Methods: We performed a narrative review of the literature using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases for articles published from 1955 to 2021. Results: Mineral metabolism in the mother must adapt to the demand created by the fetus and the placenta, which together absorb calcium and other minerals from the mother to mineralize the developing fetal skeleton; analyses of iliac bone biopsies at the beginning and end of pregnancy have shown that pregnancy significantly modifies maternal bone status. The greatest demand for calcium for the maternal skeleton occurs during lactation; women who breastfeed have an even greater loss of calcium to produce milk. However, it is controversial whether breastfeeding can increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures, and the possible mechanism is considerably complicated. Osteoporosis in pregnancy is an uncommon disease characterized by the occurrence of fragility fractures, most commonly in the vertebral column, in the third trimester of pregnancy, or early postpartum. The pathogenesis of PLO remains unclear owing to its rarity; DXA provides a sensitive and specific method for diagnosing osteoporosis by measuring BMD, one of the parameters that allow a better understanding of fracture risk. One limitation is the controversy in using radiation in pregnant women and the risk to the embryo/fetus; a safe alternative can be MRI. Conclusion: Pregnancy and lactation alter the maternal bone status; without a balance in metabolism, this may cause an increased risk of fracture due to changes in BMD. There is little information on BMD during pregnancy; more clinical studies are required to elucidate if this represents a risk factor for osteoporosis.",0.12536737322807312

The highest intake of cereals and lowest intake of milk &amp; milk products was observed in rural and tribal subjects whereas, the intake of cereals, milk &amp; milk products were similar in both urban and metropolitan subjects. One of the reasons for lower calcium intake was the proportion of calcium derived from dairy sources. Over the past half a century, the average 30-day consumption of cereals in the rural and urban population has declined by 30%. The Per Capita Cereal Consumption (PCCC)has declined despite sustained raise in Monthly Per capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) in both rural and urban households. The cereal consumption was the highest in the lowest income group, despite spending smaller portion of their income, as cereals were supplied through public distribution system (PDS). About 85% of the Indian population are vitamin D deficient despite abundant sunlight. Dietary calcium deficiency can cause secondary vitamin D deficiency. Though India as a nation is the largest producer of milk, there is profound shortage of calcium intake in the diet with all negative consequences on bone health. There is a decline in dietary calcium in the background of upward revision of RDI/RDA. There is a gap in the production-consumption-supply chain with respect to dietary calcium. To achieve a strong bone health across India, it is imperative to have population based strategies addressing different segments including supplementing dietary/supplemental calcium in ICDS, mid-day-meals scheme, public distribution system, educational strategies. Other measures like mass food fortification, biofortification, bioaddition, leveraging digital technologies, investments from corporate sector are some measures which can address this problem.

To promote bone growth and improve bone health, it is necessary to promote the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts. Although bovine milk is known to exert a beneficial effect on bone formation, the study on the effect of bovine milk extracellular vesicles (EVs) on osteogenesis in osteoblasts is limited. In this study, we demonstrated that bovine milk EVs promoted the proliferation of human osteogenic Saos-2 cells by increasing the expression of cell cycle-related proteins. In addition, bovine milk EVs also induced the differentiation of Saos-2 cells by increasing the expression of RUNX2 and Osterix which are key transcription factors for osteoblast differentiation. Oral administration of milk EVs did not cause toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats. Furthermore, milk EVs promoted longitudinal bone growth and increased the bone mineral density of the tibia. Our findings suggest that milk EVs could be a safe and powerful applicant for enhancing osteogenesis. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Until now, calcium and vitamin D have been prescribed to promote bone formation or to prevent bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Recently, several studies to find bioactive molecules that regulate cellular functions of osteoblasts or osteoclasts are actively underway. Milk basic proteins and lactoferrin present in milk are known to promote bone formation, but they exist in small quantities and the isolation of these proteins is complicated making mass production difficult. Recently, it has been found that milk contains large quantities of EVs, and that they promote bone formation.

The syndrome was first recognized in the early 20th century when Bertram Sippy introduced a treatment regimen for peptic ulcer disease. The ‘Sippy regimen’ consisted of multiple daily doses of milk and cream combined with an absorbable alkali such as magnesium oxide, sodium bicarbonate, or bismuth subcarbonate to protect the gastric ulcer from further erosion by gastric acid. The results were highly favorable, and it soon became a popular therapy. Soon after, various toxic effects, including hypercalcemia and metabolic alkalosis, were reported. Some cases with acute kidney injury were also reported. With the advent of newer drugs for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, such as histamine type-2 receptor blockers in the 1980s, the syndrome virtually vanished from the world. Recently, however, an increased number of cases of the milk-alkali syndrome have been reported. This is likely due to the common use of over-the-counter preparations of calcium for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. Calcium carbonate is also frequently prescribed to patients with chronic kidney disease for the prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Various scholars have also suggested changing the name of the syndrome to calcium-alkali syndrome due to the changing etiopathology. Milk-alkali syndrome now accounts for more than 10% of the cases of hypercalcemia and is the third most common cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients.",0.0015335549833253026

However, subclinical vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent, and it is associated with osteoporosis and higher incidence of falls or fractures. It was reported that 96% children with rickets were breastfed, since breast milk contains inadequate vitamin D. The American Academy of Pediatrics 2008 recommended infants who were exclusively or partially breastfed required 400 international units vitamin D daily from the first few days of life. Furthermore, since vitamin D receptors are present all over the body, insufficient vitamin D status may correlate with several extra-skeletal effects, such as pregnancy-related complications and immune dysfunction. This paper discusses the researches regarding system-based vitamin D effects, the possible risk factors leading to vitamin D deficiency, and the recommendations of vitamin D requirements. It is well-known that vitamin D can be obtained by sun exposure or limited natural dietary sources. The American Academy of Dermatology declared ultraviolet radiation to be a known skin carcinogen, so it may not be safe or efficient to obtain vitamin D via sun exposure or other artificial sources. Therefore, many pediatricians and physicians recommend appropriate vitamin D supplementation to achieve optimal plasma concentration. Trials assessing the effects of vitamin D repletion and establishing its optimum serum level are ongoing. Medical advice for vitamin D supplementation should be individualized accordingly.",0.9986940026283264

During lactation, the monoamine serotonin regulates the synthesis and release of various mammary gland-derived factors, such as parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), to stimulate bone resorption. Recent evidence suggests that bone mineral lost during prolonged lactation is not fully recovered following weaning, possibly putting women at increased risk of fracture or osteoporosis. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants have also been associated with reduced bone mineral density and increased fracture risk. Therefore, SSRI exposure while breastfeeding may exacerbate lactational bone loss, compromising long-term bone health. Through an examination of serotonin and calcium homeostasis during lactation, lactational bone turnover and post-weaning recovery of bone mineral, and the effect of peripartum depression and SSRI on the mammary gland and bone, this review will discuss the hypothesis that peripartum SSRI exposure causes persistent reductions in bone mineral density through mammary-derived PTHrP signaling with bone.",0.0004644600267056376

The problems have arisen due to the direct effect of COVID 19 infection and treatment or as repercussions of administrative efforts being undertaken to check the rapid spread of the epidemic. The management of some of the diseases has been hampered with the implementation of the policies like lockdown and transportation difficulties. This paper presents a series of four patients (6 eyes with vision loss) of an otherwise benign entity, Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AFRS), causing visual deterioration, managed amid the pandemic. AFRS has been known to cause vision loss by pressure over the optic nerve or its blood supply; however, a timely surgical intervention in the form of functional endoscopic sinus surgery to remove the disease and decompress the optic nerve, results in favourable outcomes in most patients. A delay in diagnosis and treatment may result in irreparable damage with the resulting inability to salvage the vision. In our series, we observed that vision recovery could be achieved in 66.7% of the affected eyes (four out of six eyes), while a poor visual outcome was observed in two (33%). The poor visual outcome was observed for the eyes with a prolonged visual impairment (4-6 months) at the time of presentation. We would appeal to the physicians to be cognizant of the adverse outcomes associated with the delayed surgical intervention of AFRS in the current pandemic scenario.",0.9942108392715454

In this review, we present new studies investigating the complex immunology that links these diseases. Advances in new therapies as well as evidence regarding indication and timing of surgery, especially of more complex cases, are highlighted. Recent findings: New studies have endotyped patients in an effort to describe the exact inflammatory profile of each phenotype, whereas described cytokines seem to play a significant role in amplification of T2 inflammation, directly or via innate lymphoid cells. New mAbs that block specific cytokines of these pathways have been developed and seem to show reduced asthma severity as well as improved sinonasal outcomes. Moreover, it has been shown that operating early in the course of disease leads not only to bigger improvements in SNOT-22 outcomes but also to reduced asthma incidence postoperatively in refractory cases. Summary: Applying data from current studies in clinical practice, we could better manage refractory cases with asthma and polyps, both medically and surgically.

11_h,health_belief,12812132,Does nasal polyp cause nasal block?,nasal polyp causes nasal block,1.0,"Nasal polyposis is an invalidating disease which develops through chronic inflammation which leads to tissue oedema and eventually polyps. Treatment is aimed at eliminating polyps, resolving rhinitis symptoms, re-establishing nasal breathing and olfaction and preventing recurrence. The pathogenesis can be explained, in part, by degranulation of mast cells and release of mediators attracting eosinophils which, in turn, can cause tissue damage and oedema. Neurovascular reflexes and factors related to the complex anatomy of ethmoidal labyrinth may be responsible for the onset and persistence of oedema. This would offer a rationale to treatments modifying ethmoid anatomy and blocking neurovascular reflexes in the management of nasal polyposis. The advent of microsurgery and of diagnostic and operative endoscopy has led, over the last twenty years, to earlier detection and to less traumatic and more precise surgical treatment of nasal polyps. With these techniques resection of parasympathetic innervation is also possible, which is in keeping with the proposed rationale and cannot be easily achieved by conventional surgery. To evaluate the impact of this resection on the management of nasal polyposis a review of data has been made in a series of patients with diagnosis of nasal polyposis established by clinical examination, resistant to pharmacological therapy and treated between 1983 and 1998 at the Oto-Neuro-Ophthalmology Department of Florence University (Italy). Patients were treated by conventional surgery (386 cases), by microsurgery without resection of the parasympathetic component of the vidian nerve (97 cases), or by microsurgery with resection of this latter component (94 cases). The rate of recurrence and of major post-operative complications, respectively, were: 39.9% and 4.4% for patients treated by conventional surgery; 37.1% and 6.2% with microsurgery without resection of parasympathetic innervation; and 25.5% and 2.1% with resection of this innervation. The difference in recurrence rate between the three groups was significant (p 0.05). The average disease-free interval was 45.7 months with conventional surgery and 53.5 months with microsurgery (regardless of resection of innervation).

11_h,health_belief,3140703,Does nasal polyp cause nasal block?,nasal polyp causes nasal block,1.0,"Headaches can be of sinugenic origin even if this cause may not be suspected from the case history. Endoscopy of the lateral nasal wall with rigid cold light endoscopes in combination with polytomography or computed tomography usually will reveal the underlying causes hidden from the unaided eye, the operating microscope, and standard x-ray examination. Small lesions in the lesser cells of the ethmoid complex may give rise to headaches, especially when located in the key areas of the ethmoid infundibulum or frontal recess. Many anatomic variations of the structures in the middle meatus can narrow the stenotic clefts even more and thus predispose to more or less intense contact of opposing mucosal surfaces. This may impede or block ventilation and drainage of the ethmoid and surrounding larger sinuses and thus affect those as well. After identification of these underlying causes, functional endoscopic sinus surgery with usually minimal operations often can provide dramatic relief of symptoms that may have been present for months or even years. The neuropeptides recently were newly identified as a group of mediators besides the neurotransmitters noradrenalin and acetylcholine. Substance P (SP) is one of the most important neuropeptides that we can identify in the human nasal mucosa. It mediates pain impulses to the cortex via afferent C fibers. Simultaneously from polymodal receptors in the nasal mucosa, local reflexes are mediated by SP via an axon reflex, causing vasodilatation, plasma extravasation (""neurogenic edema""), and hypersecretion. The receptors can be stimulated by chemical and caloric irritants and also mechanical irritants such as pressure. The pressure exerted on nasal mucosa by polyps or mucosal swelling due to other reasons in the ethmoid clefts, cells, and narrow spaces apparently can be enough to trigger an SP-mediated pain sensation via afferent C fibers. Over the axon reflex an initially small lesion may lead in a vicious circle to quite significant symptoms. The model of ""referred pain"" explains why the pain is not necessarily felt at its origin, but may be projected onto corresponding dermatomes. The pain-mediating function of SP can be blocked selectively by capsaicin, the pungent component of red pepper, which leads to desensitization of the receptors and degeneration of the afferent C fibers without affecting other sensory qualities. In patients with vasomotor rhinitis we were able to block all the patients' symptoms including headaches by topical administration of capsaicin. After identification of underlying causes with endoscopy and CT, lesions and contact areas should be operated upon if medical treatment fails.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0.9997649788856506

The role of placenta-specific virulence factors is particularly important for researchers to understand how it crosses the placental barrier and infects the fetus during LM infection. This review started by describing the listeriosis in pregnant women, followed by summarizing the advances in understanding the LM vertical transplacental infection and the mechanism of LM colonization in the placenta.

In the latter case, the pathology can be the cause of premature birth or spontaneous abortion, especially if the fetus is affected during the first months of gestation. The causative agent of listeriosis, Listeria monocytogenes , is characterized by the innate ability to survive in the environment and in food, even in adverse conditions and for long periods.

While the Macavirus genus contains agents, including alcelaphine gammaherpesvirus 1 (AlGHV1), ovine gammaherpesvirus 2 (OvGHV2), and caprine gammaherpesvirus-2 (CpGHV2), known to cause malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), and are collectively referred to as MCF virus (MCFV) group of organisms, diseases and/or clinical syndromes have not been associated with BoGHV6 and porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus (PLHV). This report investigated the occurrence of BoGHV6 in tissues of aborted dairy fetuses known to be infected by Histophilus somni to identify possible disease patterns associated with infection by this Macavirus. A nested-PCR (nPCR) assay was used to amplify the BoGHV6 polymerase gene from multiple tissues of 13 fetuses and the cow of one of these which were derived from seven dairy herds located in three geographical regions of Brazil. Direct sequencing confirmed the results of the nPCR assays. Additionally, all fetal tissues were previously investigated for the presence of H. somni, Listeria monocytogenes, Neospora caninum, Brucella abortus, Leptospira spp., bovine alphaherpesvirus 1, and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) by PCR and/or RT-PCR assays. The nPCR assay amplified BoGHV6 DNA from fetuses of most dairy herds (85.7%; 6/7) investigated, resulting in the amplification of BoGHV6 from 76.9% (10/13) of all fetuses evaluated from two geographical and important cattle-producing regions of Brazil. Furthermore, only BoGHV6 was identified in the spleen (n = 3), myocardium, and kidney (n = 2) of five fetuses, and BoGHV6 was the only agent associated with myocarditis in one of these. Nevertheless, dual, triple, and quadruple infections (including BVDV, B. abortus, and N. caninum) were identified in fetuses that were concomitantly infected by H. somni. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strain herein identified has 100% nucleotide (nt) sequence identity with wild type strains of BoGHV6 circulating in ruminants from Brazil and 99.8% nt identity with the reference strain of BoGHV6 but was 72.2-73.3% and 67.4-68.2% different from members of the MCFV group and PLHV, respectively. These results demonstrated that 76.9% of the fetuses evaluated were infected by BoGHV6, most likely via vertical infection resulting in transplacental transmission. Considering that most fetuses were concomitantly infected by BoGHV6 and H. somni the real impact of this viral infection cannot be efficiently determined. However, since BoGHV6 was the only pathogen identified in the myocardium of one fetus with myocarditis by histopathology, the possible participation of this Macavirus in the etiopathogenesis of the myocardial disease observed in this fetus cannot be ignored or discarded. However, the mere amplification of BoGHV6 DNA from the myocardium is not enough to establish a definite association between cause and effect, since in situ evaluations and experimental studies would be needed to confirm this agent in the etiopathogenesis of fetal diseases and/or abortions in cattle. Consequently, additional studies are needed to determine the exact role, if any, of BoGHV6 in the development of fetal disease, and possibly fetal mortality.",0.0007884639198891819

Compared with the general population, the risk of being diagnosed with listeriosis increases during pregnancy. Listeriosis can lead to miscarriage, spontaneous preterm labour and preterm birth, stillbirth and congenital neonatal infections. Objectives: We conducted a universal review of listeriosis in pregnancy and in the newborn. Search strategy: The EMBASE, PubMed, Cinahl and Web of Science databases were searched for systematic reviews indexed before 1 December 2020. Selection criteria: Any systematic reviews evaluating the prevalence, treatment, diagnosis and effects of listeriosis during pregnancy and up to 4 weeks postnatally were included. Data collection and analysis: Eligibility assessment, data extraction and quality assessment by the Methodological Quality Assessment of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) were performed in duplicate. Main results: We identified 397 citations of which nine systematic reviews comprising 330 studies and 487 patients' reviews were included. Most systematic reviews (seven of nine) were of moderate to high quality. Prevention in pregnant women was based on adherence to strict dietary recommendations, such as reheating leftovers until steamed and avoiding unpasteurised dairy products. Listeriosis infections were likely to occur in the third trimester (66%) rather than in the first trimester (3%) of pregnancy. Symptoms are mostly fever and other flu-like symptoms, such as fatigue. Diagnosis was primarily made by culture of the pathogen. Intravenous amoxicillin or ampicillin were first-line treatment. Conclusions: Listeriosis, a rare but serious infectious disease in pregnancy, can cause devastating consequences for the fetus and newborn. Appropriate preventative treatment should be initiated during early pregnancy to avoid complications. Tweetable abstract: Listeria is commonly found in processed and prepared food.

Rubella virus was the first infectious disease to be linked to congenital malformations due to an infection in pregnancy, which can include congenital cataracts, microcephaly, hearing impairment and congenital heart disease. Currently, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the leading infectious cause of congenital malformations globally, affecting 1 in every 200 infants. However, our knowledge of teratogenic viruses and pathogens is far from complete. New emerging infectious diseases may induce teratogenesis, similar to Zika virus (ZIKV) that caused a global pandemic in 2016-2017; thousands of neonates were born with congenital microcephaly due to ZIKV exposure in utero , which also included a spectrum of injuries to the brain, eyes and spinal cord. In addition to congenital anomalies, permanent injury to fetal and neonatal organs, preterm birth, stillbirth and spontaneous abortion are known consequences of a broader group of infectious diseases including group B streptococcus (GBS), Listeria monocytogenes , Influenza A virus (IAV), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Animal models are crucial for determining the mechanism of how these various infectious diseases induce teratogenesis or organ injury, as well as testing novel therapeutics for fetal or neonatal protection. Other mammalian models differ in many respects from human pregnancy including placentation, labor physiology, reproductive tract anatomy, timeline of fetal development and reproductive toxicology. In contrast, non-human primates (NHP) most closely resemble human pregnancy and exhibit key similarities that make them ideal for research to discover the mechanisms of injury and for testing vaccines and therapeutics to prevent teratogenesis, fetal and neonatal injury and adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., stillbirth or spontaneous abortion). In this review, we emphasize key contributions of the NHP model pre-clinical research for ZIKV, HCMV, HIV, IAV, L. monocytogenes , Ureaplasma species, and GBS.

To better understand how the unique immunological milieu of pregnancy increases susceptibility to infection, we study listeriosis in cynomolgus macaques, a non-human primate that closely resembles humans in placentation and in the physiology, and immunology of pregnancy. Non-human primates are naturally susceptible to Lm infection, and spontaneous abortions due to listeriosis are known to occur in outdoor macaque colonies, making them ideal models to understand the disease pathogenesis and host-pathogen relationship of listeriosis. We have previously shown that Lm infection in the first trimester has a high rate of miscarriage. This study expands on our previous findings by assessing how the quantity of Lm as well as stage of pregnancy at the time of exposure may influence disease susceptibility. In the current study we inoculated a cohort of macaques with a lower dose of Lm than our previous study and although this did not result in fetal demise, there was evidence of in utero inflammation and fetal distress. Animals that were reinfected with an equivalent or higher dose of the same strain of Lm resulted in approximately half of cases continuing to term and half ending in fetal demise. These cases had inconsistent bacterial colonization of the fetal compartment, suggesting that Lm does not need to directly infect the placenta to cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. Timed surgical collection of tissues following inoculation demonstrated that transmission from mother to fetus can occur as soon as 5 days post-inoculation. Lastly, third trimester inoculation resulted in pregnancy loss in 3 out of 4 macaques, accompanied by characteristic pathology and Lm colonization. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that common laboratory culture tests may not always recover Lm despite known maternal ingestion.
