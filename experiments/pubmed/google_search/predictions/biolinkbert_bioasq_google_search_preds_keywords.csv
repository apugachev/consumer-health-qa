1,2019,19441868,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) refers to the presence of clinical signs and symptoms arising from the genitourinary tract plus the presence of one or more micro-organisms in the urine exceeding a threshold value for significance (ranges from 102 to 103 colony-forming units/mL). Infections are localized to the bladder (cystitis), renal parenchyma (pyelonephritis) or prostate (acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis). Single UTI episodes are very common, especially in adult women where there is a 50-fold predominance compared with adult men. In addition, recurrent UTIs are also common, occurring in up to one-third of women after first-episode UTIs. Recurrences requiring intervention are usually defined as two or more episodes over 6 months or three or more episodes over 1 year (this definition applies only to young women with acute uncomplicated UTIs). A cornerstone of prevention of UTI recurrence has been the use of low-dose once-daily or post-coital antimicrobials; however, much interest has surrounded non-antimicrobial-based approaches undergoing investigation such as use of probiotics, vaccines, oligosaccharide inhibitors of bacterial adherence and colonization, and bacterial interference with immunoreactive extracts of Escherichia coli. Local (intravaginal) estrogen therapy has had mixed results to date. Cranberry products in a variety of formulations have also undergone extensive evaluation over several decades in the management of UTIs. At present, there is no evidence that cranberry can be used to treat UTIs. Hence, the focus has been on its use as a preventative strategy. Cranberry has been effective in vitro and in vivo in animals for the prevention of UTI. Cranberry appears to work by inhibiting the adhesion of type I and P-fimbriated uropathogens (e.g. uropathogenic E. coli) to the uroepithelium, thus impairing colonization and subsequent infection. The isolation of the component(s) of cranberry with this activity has been a daunting task, considering the hundreds of compounds found in the fruit and its juice derivatives. Reasonable evidence suggests that the anthocyanidin/proanthocyanidin moieties are potent antiadhesion compounds. However, problems still exist with standardization of cranberry products, which makes it extremely difficult to compare products or extrapolate results. Unfortunately, most clinical trials have had design deficiencies and none have evaluated specific key cranberry-derived compounds considered likely to be active moieties (e.g. proanthocyanidins). In general, the preventive efficacy of cranberry has been variable and modest at best. Meta-analyses have established that recurrence rates over 1 year are reduced approximately 35% in young to middle-aged women. The efficacy of cranberry in other groups (i.e. elderly, paediatric patients, those with neurogenic bladder, those with chronic indwelling urinary catheters) is questionable. Withdrawal rates have been quite high (up to 55%), suggesting that these products may not be acceptable over long periods. Adverse events include gastrointestinal intolerance, weight gain (due to the excessive calorie load) and drug-cranberry interactions (due to the inhibitory effect of flavonoids on cytochrome P450-mediated drug metabolism). The findings of the Cochrane Collaboration support the potential use of cranberry products in the prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs in young and middle-aged women. However, in light of the heterogeneity of clinical study designs and the lack of consensus regarding the dosage regimen and formulation to use, cranberry products cannot be recommended for the prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs at this time.",0.24287736415863037
1,2019,23076891,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Background: Cranberries have been used widely for several decades for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). This is the third update of our review first published in 1998 and updated in 2004 and 2008. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations. Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library) and the Internet. We contacted companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations and checked reference lists of review articles and relevant studies.Date of search: July 2012 Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry products for the prevention of UTIs. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed and extracted data. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (incidence of symptomatic UTIs, positive culture results, side effects, adherence to therapy). Risk ratios (RR) were calculated where appropriate, otherwise a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Main results: This updated review includes a total of 24 studies (six cross-over studies, 11 parallel group studies with two arms; five with three arms, and two studies with a factorial design) with a total of 4473 participants. Ten studies were included in the 2008 update, and 14 studies have been added to this update. Thirteen studies (2380 participants) evaluated only cranberry juice/concentrate; nine studies (1032 participants) evaluated only cranberry tablets/capsules; one study compared cranberry juice and tablets; and one study compared cranberry capsules and tablets. The comparison/control arms were placebo, no treatment, water, methenamine hippurate, antibiotics, or lactobacillus. Eleven studies were not included in the meta-analyses because either the design was a cross-over study and data were not reported separately for the first phase, or there was a lack of relevant data. Data included in the meta-analyses showed that, compared with placebo, water or not treatment, cranberry products did not significantly reduce the occurrence of symptomatic UTI overall (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.04) or for any the subgroups: women with recurrent UTIs (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.31); older people (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.44); pregnant women (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.17); children with recurrent UTI (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.22); cancer patients (RR 1.15 95% CI 0.75 to 1.77); or people with neuropathic bladder or spinal injury (RR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.20). Overall heterogeneity was moderate (I² = 55%). The effectiveness of cranberry was not significantly different to antibiotics for women (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.85, 2.02) and children (RR 0.69 95% CI 0.32 to 1.51). There was no significant difference between gastrointestinal adverse effects from cranberry product compared to those of placebo/no treatment (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.27). Many studies reported low compliance and high withdrawal/dropout problems which they attributed to palatability/acceptability of the products, primarily the cranberry juice. Most studies of other cranberry products (tablets and capsules) did not report how much of the 'active' ingredient the product contained, and therefore the products may not have had enough potency to be effective. Authors' conclusions: Prior to the current update it appeared there was some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12 month period, particularly for women with recurrent UTIs. The addition of 14 further studies suggests that cranberry juice is less effective than previously indicated. Although some of small studies demonstrated a small benefit for women with recurrent UTIs, there were no statistically significant differences when the results of a much larger study were included. Cranberry products were not significantly different to antibiotics for preventing UTIs in three small studies. Given the large number of dropouts/withdrawals from studies (mainly attributed to the acceptability of consuming cranberry products particularly juice, over long periods), and the evidence that the benefit for preventing UTI is small, cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of UTIs. Other preparations (such as powders) need to be quantified using standardised methods to ensure the potency, and contain enough of the 'active' ingredient, before being evaluated in clinical studies or recommended for use.",0.15170656144618988

The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of cranberries in preventing such infections. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of cranberry juice and other cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations. Search strategy: Electronic databases and the Internet were searched using English and non English language terms; companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations were contacted; reference lists of review articles and relevant trials were searched. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - the Cochrane Library, issue 1, 2003) was searched in February 2003. Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi randomised controlled trials of cranberry juice/products for the prevention of urinary tract infections in susceptible populations. Trials of men, women or children were included. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted information. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (urinary tract infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic), side effects and adherence to therapy). RR were calculated where appropriate, otherwise a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane criteria. Main results: Seven trials met the inclusion criteria (four cross-over, three parallel group). The effectiveness of cranberry juice (or cranberry-lingonberry juice) versus placebo juice or water was evaluated in six trials, and the effectiveness of cranberries tablets versus placebo was evaluated in two trials (one study evaluated both juice and tablets). In two good quality RCTs, cranberry products significantly reduced the incidence of UTIs at twelve months (RR 0.61 95% CI:0.40 to 0.91) compared with placebo/control in women. One trial gave 7.5 g cranberry concentrate daily (in 50 ml), the other gave 1:30 concentrate given either in 250 ml juice or in tablet form. There was no significant difference in the incidence of UTIs between cranberry juice versus cranberry capsules (RR 1.11 95% CI:0.49 to 2.50). Five trials were not included in the meta-analyses due to methodological flaws or lack of available data. However, only one reported a significant result for the outcome of symptomatic UTIs. Side effects were common in all trials, and dropouts/withdrawals in several of the trials were high. Reviewers' conclusions: There is some evidence from two good quality RCTs that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12 month period in women. If it is effective for other groups such as children and elderly men and women is not clear. The large number of dropouts/withdrawals from some of the trials indicates that cranberry juice may not be acceptable over long periods of time. In addition it is not clear what is the optimum dosage or method of administration (e.g. juice or tablets). Further properly designed trials with relevant outcomes are needed.",0.3480490446090698
1,2019,27184277,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Cranberry has been used traditionally to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs), primarily among generally healthy women prone to recurrent UTIs. Results from a number of published clinical studies have supported this benefit; however, meta-analyses on cranberry and UTI prevention have reported conflicting conclusions. This article explores the methodological differences that contributed to these disparate findings. Despite similar research questions, the meta-analyses varied in the studies that were included, as well as the data that were extracted. In the 2 most comprehensive systematic reviews, heterogeneity was handled differently, leading to an I(2) of 65% in one and 43% in the other. Most notably, the populations influencing the conclusions varied. In one analysis, populations with pathological/physiological conditions contributed 75.6% of the total weight to the summary risk estimate (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.04); another weighted the evidence relatively equally across UTI populations (RR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.80); and a third included only women with recurrent UTIs (RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.83). Because women with recurrent UTIs are the group to whom most recommendations regarding cranberry consumption is directed, inclusion of other groups in the efficacy assessment could influence clinical practice quality. Therefore, conclusions on cranberry and UTIs should consider differences in results across various populations studied when interpreting results from meta-analyses.",0.18104441463947296
1,2019,28288837,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Purpose: We sought to clarify the association between cranberry intake and the prevention of urinary tract infections. Materials and methods: This systematic review, which complies with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) statement, was done as a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of clinical trials. Results: The findings clearly showed the potential use of cranberries for the clinical condition of urinary tract infection. Cranberry products significantly reduced the incidence of urinary tract infections as indicated by the weighted risk ratio (0.6750, 95% CI 0.5516-0.7965, p 0.0001). The results of subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients at some risk for urinary tract infections were more susceptible to the effects of cranberry ingestion. Conclusions: The results of the current study could be used by physicians to recommend cranberry ingestion to decrease the incidence of urinary tract infections, particularly in individuals with recurrent urinary tract infections. This would also reduce the administration of antibiotics, which could be beneficial since antibiotics can lead to the worldwide emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms.",0.5424613356590271
1,2019,29046404,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Background: Cranberry ( Vaccinium spp.) has been advocated for treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI); however, its efficacy is controversial. Women have a 50% risk of UTI over their lifetime, and ∼20-30% experience a subsequent UTI recurrence. Objective: We conducted this meta-analysis to assess the effect of cranberry on the risk of UTI recurrence in otherwise healthy women. Methods: Literature published before January 2011 was obtained from 2 published systematic reviews, and we conducted updated searches in EMBASE and MEDLINE (through July 2017). We included randomized controlled trials that were conducted in generally healthy nonpregnant women aged ≥18 y with a history of UTI, compared cranberry intervention to a placebo or control, and reported the outcome as the number of participants experiencing a UTI. Two researchers conducted abstract and full-text screenings, data extractions, and risk of bias assessments independently, and discrepancies were resolved by group consensus. Meta-analyses were performed by using Stata SE software (version 13). We employed a fixed-effect model using the Mantel-Haenszel method to estimate the summary risk if the heterogeneity was low to moderate ( I <sup>2</sup> 50%). Otherwise, we applied a random-effects model using the DerSimonian-Laird method. Results: We identified 7 randomized controlled trials conducted in healthy women at risk of UTI ( n = 1498 participants). Results of the meta-analysis showed that cranberry reduced the risk of UTI by 26% (pooled risk ratio: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.98; I <sup>2</sup> = 54%). Risk of bias indicated that 2 studies had high loss to follow-up or selective outcome reporting. Overall, the studies were relatively small, with only 2 having &gt;300 participants. Conclusion: These results suggest that cranberry may be effective in preventing UTI recurrence in generally healthy women; however, larger high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.

1,2019,21788542,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Background: The increasing prevalence of uropathogens resistant to antimicrobial agents has stimulated interest in cranberries to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Methods: In a double-blind, double-dummy noninferiority trial, 221 premenopausal women with recurrent UTIs were randomized to 12-month prophylaxis use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), 480 mg once daily, or cranberry capsules, 500 mg twice daily. Primary end points were the mean number of symptomatic UTIs over 12 months, the proportion of patients with at least 1 symptomatic UTI, the median time to first UTI, and development of antibiotic resistance in indigenous Escherichia coli. Results: After 12 months, the mean number of patients with at least 1 symptomatic UTI was higher in the cranberry than in the TMP-SMX group (4.0 vs 1.8; P = .02), and the proportion of patients with at least 1 symptomatic UTI was higher in the cranberry than in the TMP-SMX group (78.2% vs 71.1%). Median time to the first symptomatic UTI was 4 months for the cranberry and 8 months for the TMP-SMX group. After 1 month, in the cranberry group, 23.7% of fecal and 28.1% of asymptomatic bacteriuria E coli isolates were TMP-SMX resistant, whereas in the TMP-SMX group, 86.3% of fecal and 90.5% of asymptomatic bacteriuria E coli isolates were TMP-SMX resistant. Similarly, we found increased resistance rates for trimethoprim, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin in these E coli isolates after 1 month in the TMP-SMX group. After discontinuation of TMP-SMX, resistance reached baseline levels after 3 months. Antibiotic resistance did not increase in the cranberry group. Cranberries and TMP-SMX were equally well tolerated. Conclusion: In premenopausal women, TMP-SMX, 480 mg once daily, is more effective than cranberry capsules, 500 mg twice daily, to prevent recurrent UTIs, at the expense of emerging antibiotic resistance.

1,2019,24139545,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections, and over 50% of women will have a UTI during their lifetimes. Antibiotics are used for prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs but can lead to emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Therefore, it is reasonable to investigate nutritional strategies for prevention of UTIs. Cranberry juices and supplements have been used for UTI prophylaxis, but with variable efficacy. Because dried cranberries may contain a different spectrum of polyphenolics than juice, consuming berries may or may not be more beneficial than juice in decreasing the incidence of UTIs in susceptible women. The primary objectives of this study were to determine if consumption of sweetened, dried cranberries (SDC) decreases recurrent UTIs and whether this intervention would alter the heterogeneity, virulence factor (VF) profiles, or numbers of intestinal E. coli. Methods: Twenty women with recurrent UTIs were enrolled in the trial and consumed one serving of SDC daily for two weeks. Clinical efficacy was determined by two criteria, a decrease in the six-month UTI rates pre- and post-consumption and increased time until the first UTI since beginning the study. Strain heterogeneity and virulence factor profiles of intestinal E. coli isolated from rectal swabs were determined by DNA fingerprinting and muliplex PCR, respectively. The numbers of intestinal E. coli eluted from rectal swabs pre- and post-consumption were also quantified. Results: Over one-half of the patients did not experience a UTI within six months of SDC consumption, and the mean UTI rate per six months decreased significantly. Kaplan-Meier analysis of infection incidence in women consuming SDC compared to patients in a previous control group showed a significant reduction in time until first UTI within six months. The heterogeneity, VF profiles, and prevalence of intestinal E. coli strains were not significantly different after cranberry consumption. Conclusions: Results of this study indicate a beneficial effect from consuming SDC to reduce the number of UTIs in susceptible women. Because there were no changes in the heterogeneity or VF profiles of E. coli, additional studies are needed to determine the mechanism of action of SDC for reduction of UTIs.",0.34044983983039856
1,2019,34473789,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"The efficacy of cranberry (Vaccinium spp.) as adjuvant therapy in preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs) remains controversial. This study aims to update and determine cranberry effects as adjuvant therapy on the recurrence rate of UTIs in susceptible groups. According to PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a literature search in Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from their inception dates to June 2021. We included articles with data on the incidence of UTIs in susceptible populations using cranberry-containing products. We then conducted a trial sequential analysis to control the risk of type I and type II errors. This meta-analysis included 23 trials with 3979 participants. We found that cranberry-based products intake can significantly reduce the incidence of UTIs in susceptible populations (risk ratio (RR) = 0.70; 95% confidence interval(CI): 0.59 ~ 0.83; P 0.01). We identified a relative risk reduction of 32%, 45% and 51% in women with recurrent UTIs (RR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.56 ~ 0.81), children (RR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.31 ~ 0.97) and patients using indwelling catheters (RR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.33 ~ 0.73). Meanwhile, a relative risk reduction of 35% in people who use cranberry juice compared with those who use cranberry capsule or tablet was observed in the subgroup analysis (RR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.54 ~ 0.77). The TSA result for the effects of cranberry intake and the decreased risk of UTIs in susceptible groups indicated that the effects were conclusive. In conclusion, our meta-analysis demonstrates that cranberry supplementation significantly reduced the risk of developing UTIs in susceptible populations. Cranberry can be considered as adjuvant therapy for preventing UTIs in susceptible populations. However, given the limitations of the included studies in this meta-analysis, the conclusion should be interpreted with caution.",0.46365123987197876

Ten trials were carried out in China and one in Norway.Two trials found that more children treated with needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs achieved 75% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.05) and 50% or greater reduction in seizure duration (pooled RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.62) compared with Chinese herbs alone. However, after combining the results of four trials that compared the treatment group with a control group that could yield the net effect of needle acupuncture, we found that there was no significant difference between the treatment and the control groups in any reduction of seizure frequency (pooled RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.17). Compared to phenytoin, the pooled results from two trials showed that patients who received needle acupuncture appeared more likely to achieve 75% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (pooled RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.1). Compared to valproate, the pooled results from three trials showed catgut implantation at acupoints appeared more likely to result in 75% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (pooled RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 5.36).

3,2019,34311182,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"Objective: To assess seizure frequency and quality of life (QOL) in a group of adults with temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS) before and after 10 weeks of systemic acupuncture sessions and compare the results with a group of patients with TLE-HS not undergoing acupuncture. Methods: The Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31) and the initial and final seizure frequency of 26 adult patients with TLE-HS who underwent acupuncture sessions for 10 consecutive weeks were assessed. The data were compared to those of 26 patients with TLE-HS not submitted to acupuncture, with p 0.05. Results: There was a clinically significant effect in reducing the mean number of seizures per month in the follow-up period of patients submitted or not to acupuncture (no intervention group and intervention group, effect size: -0.94 and -1.01, respectively). In the last four weeks of follow-up, there was a significant difference between the no intervention and intervention groups (0.5 [0-2] and 0 [0-4]; p = 0.018). When using minimally important change (MIC) threshold data for the QOLIE-31 between the final and initial scores, with the Cantril Ladder Scale as anchoring, it was observed that, in the intervention group, large clinically significant effects were seen for all dimensions, except for cognitive function, medication effect, and social function, which presented medium effects. In the follow-up, the variation of the QOLIE-31 scores was positive for both groups; however, it was higher in all dimensions in the intervention group, indicating a better QOL. Conclusion: There was a reduction in the mean number of seizures per month in all patients during the follow-up period. Acupuncture significantly reduced the number of seizures in the intervention group in the final phase of the study. QOL improvements occurred in all patients, however, more significantly in the intervention group.",0.47750261425971985

While holding promise, they are invasive interventions with serious complications and adverse effects. Moreover, their efficacies are modest with less seizure free. Acupuncture is a simple, safe, and effective traditional healing modality for a wide range of diseases including pain and epilepsy. Thalamus takes critical role in sensory transmission and is highly involved in epilepsy genesis particularly the absence epilepsy. Considering thalamus serves as a convergent structure for both acupuncture and VNS and the thalamic neuronal activities can be modulated by acupuncture, we propose that acupuncture could be a promising therapy or at least a screening tool to select suitable candidates for those invasive modalities in the management of refractory epilepsy.",0.4709051251411438

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: This study was based on Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database that included information on stroke patients hospitalised between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2004. Participants: We identified 42 040 patients hospitalised with newly diagnosed stroke who were aged 20 years and above. Primary and secondary outcome measures: We compared incident epilepsy during the follow-up period until the end of 2009 in stroke patients who were and were not receiving acupuncture. The adjusted HRs and 95% CIs of epilepsy associated with acupuncture were calculated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression. Results: Stroke patients who received acupuncture treatment (9.8 per 1000 person-years) experienced a reduced incidence of epilepsy compared to those who did not receive acupuncture treatment (11.5 per 1000 person-years), with an HR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.80) after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and coexisting medical conditions. Acupuncture treatment was associated with a decreased risk of epilepsy, particularly among stroke patients aged 20-69 years. The log-rank test probability curve indicated that stroke patients receiving acupuncture treatment had a reduced probability of epilepsy compared with individuals who did not receive acupuncture treatment during the follow-up period (p 0.0001). Conclusions: Stroke patients who received acupuncture treatment had a reduced risk of epilepsy compared with those not receiving acupuncture treatment.

There is increasing interest in alternative therapies such as acupuncture; however, it remains unclear whether the existing evidence is rigorous enough to support the use of acupuncture. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people with epilepsy. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (June 2005) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005). We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, TCMLARS, China Biological Medicine Database, Chinese Acupuncture Trials Register, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database from inception to June 2005. Reference lists from relevant trials were reviewed. No language restrictions were imposed. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture involving people of any age with any type of epilepsy were included. Trials included were those comparing acupuncture with placebo, sham or no treatment; or comparing acupuncture plus other treatments with the same other treatments. Trials that only compared different acupuncture methods or compared acupuncture alone with other treatments were excluded. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted trial data and assessed trial quality using the Jadad score. Relative risk (RR) was used for binary data and weighted mean difference for continuous data, and 95% confidence intervals are given. Where possible, analyses were by intention to treat. Main results: Three small trials of varying methodological quality and with short follow up met the inclusion criteria. Two studied children in China and one studied adults in Norway. The two Chinese studies compared acupuncture plus Chinese herbs with Chinese herbs alone while the Norwegian study compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture. The two Chinese studies found that more children treated with acupuncture achieved 75% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.05) and seizure duration (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.13 to 5) with a significant 50% or greater reduction in seizure duration (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.73). However, the two trials were of low quality without adequate description of randomisation method, concealment of randomisation or blinding. On the other hand, the higher quality Norwegian trial found that acupuncture did not improve the mean seizure frequency, seizure-free weeks, or quality of life in adults.

5,2019,27351677,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,"Background: Acupuncture is often used for migraine prevention but its effectiveness is still controversial. We present an update of our Cochrane review from 2009. Objectives: To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than sham (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as prophylactic treatment with drugs in reducing headache frequency in adults with episodic migraine. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL: 2016, issue 1); MEDLINE (via Ovid, 2008 to January 2016); Ovid EMBASE (2008 to January 2016); and Ovid AMED (1985 to January 2016). We checked PubMed for recent publications to April 2016. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform to February 2016 for ongoing and unpublished trials. Selection criteria: We included randomized trials at least eight weeks in duration that compared an acupuncture intervention with a no-acupuncture control (no prophylactic treatment or routine care only), a sham-acupuncture intervention, or prophylactic drug in participants with episodic migraine. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on participants, interventions, methods and results, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the acupuncture intervention. The primary outcome was migraine frequency (preferably migraine days, attacks or headache days if migraine days not measured/reported) after treatment and at follow-up. The secondary outcome was response (at least 50% frequency reduction). Safety outcomes were number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects and number of participants reporting at least one adverse effect. We calculated pooled effect size estimates using a fixed-effect model. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables. Main results: Twenty-two trials including 4985 participants in total (median 71, range 30 to 1715) met our updated selection criteria. We excluded five previously included trials from this update because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months, and included five new trials. Five trials had a no-acupuncture control group (either treatment of attacks only or non-regulated routine care), 15 a sham-acupuncture control group, and five a comparator group receiving prophylactic drug treatment. In comparisons with no-acupuncture control groups and groups receiving prophylactic drug treatment, there was risk of performance and detection bias as blinding was not possible. Overall the quality of the evidence was moderate. Comparison with no acupunctureAcupuncture was associated with a moderate reduction of headache frequency over no acupuncture after treatment (four trials, 2199 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.56; 95% CI -0.65 to -0.48); findings were statistically heterogeneous (I² = 57%; moderate quality evidence). After treatment headache frequency at least halved in 41% of participants receiving acupuncture and 17% receiving no acupuncture (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2.40; 95% CI 2.08 to 2.76; 4 studies, 2519 participants) with a corresponding number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 6); there was no indication of statistical heterogeneity (I² = 7%; moderate quality evidence). The only trial with post-treatment follow-up found a small but significant benefit 12 months after randomisation (RR 2.16; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.45; NNT 7; 95% 4 to 25; 377 participants, low quality evidence). Comparison with sham acupunctureBoth after treatment (12 trials, 1646 participants) and at follow-up (10 trials, 1534 participants), acupuncture was associated with a small but statistically significant frequency reduction over sham (moderate quality evidence). The SMD was -0.18 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.08; I² = 47%) after treatment and -0.19 (95% CI -0.30 to -0.09; I² = 59%) at follow-up. After treatment headache frequency at least halved in 50% of participants receiving true acupuncture and 41% receiving sham acupuncture (pooled RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.36; I² = 48%; 14 trials, 1825 participants) and at follow-up in 53% and 42%, respectively (pooled RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; I² = 61%; 11 trials, 1683 participants; moderate quality evidence). The corresponding NNTBs are 11 (95% CI 7.00 to 20.00) and 10 (95% CI 6.00 to 18.00), respectively. The number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects (odds ratio (OR) 2.84; 95% CI 0.43 to 18.71; 7 trials, 931 participants; low quality evidence) and the number of participants reporting adverse effects (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56; 4 trials, 1414 participants; moderate quality evidence) did not differ significantly between acupuncture and sham groups. Comparison with prophylactic drug treatmentAcupuncture reduced migraine frequency significantly more than drug prophylaxis after treatment ( SMD -0.25; 95% CI -0.39 to -0.10; 3 trials, 739 participants), but the significance was not maintained at follow-up (SMD -0.13; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.01; 3 trials, 744 participants; moderate quality evidence). After three months headache frequency at least halved in 57% of participants receiving acupuncture and 46% receiving prophylactic drugs (pooled RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44) and after six months in 59% and 54%, respectively (pooled RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.26; moderate quality evidence). Findings were consistent among trials with I² being 0% in all analyses. Trial participants receiving acupuncture were less likely to drop out due to adverse effects (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.86; 4 trials, 451 participants) and to report adverse effects (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.62; 5 trials 931 participants) than participants receiving prophylactic drugs (moderate quality evidence). Authors' conclusions: The available evidence suggests that adding acupuncture to symptomatic treatment of attacks reduces the frequency of headaches. Contrary to the previous findings, the updated evidence also suggests that there is an effect over sham, but this effect is small. The available trials also suggest that acupuncture may be at least similarly effective as treatment with prophylactic drugs.

Objective: To investigate the long-term effects of true acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture and being placed in a waiting-list control group for migraine prophylaxis. Design, setting, and participants: This was a 24-week randomized clinical trial (4 weeks of treatment followed by 20 weeks of follow-up). Participants were randomly assigned to true acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or a waiting-list control group. The trial was conducted from October 2012 to September 2014 in outpatient settings at 3 clinical sites in China. A total of 249 participants 18 to 65 years old with migraine without aura based on the criteria of the International Headache Society, with migraine occurring 2 to 8 times per month. Interventions: Participants in the true acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups received treatment 5 days per week for 4 weeks for a total of 20 sessions. Participants in the waiting-list group did not receive acupuncture but were informed that 20 sessions of acupuncture would be provided free of charge at the end of the trial. Main outcomes and measures: Participants used diaries to record migraine attacks. The primary outcome was the change in the frequency of migraine attacks from baseline to week 16. Secondary outcome measures included the migraine days, average headache severity, and medication intake every 4 weeks within 24 weeks. Results: A total of 249 participants 18 to 65 years old were enrolled, and 245 were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. One hundred eighty-nine (77.1%) were women. Baseline characteristics were comparable across the 3 groups. The mean (SD) change in frequency of migraine attacks differed significantly among the 3 groups at 16 weeks after randomization (P .001); the mean (SD) frequency of attacks decreased in the true acupuncture group by 3.2 (2.1), in the sham acupuncture group by 2.1 (2.5), and the waiting-list group by 1.4 (2.5); a greater reduction was observed in the true acupuncture than in the sham acupuncture group (difference of 1.1 attacks; 95% CI, 0.4-1.9; P = .002) and in the true acupuncture vs waiting-list group (difference of 1.8 attacks; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5; P .001). Sham acupuncture was not statistically different from the waiting-list group (difference of 0.7 attacks; 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.4; P = .07).

5,2019,22231691,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,"Background: Acupuncture is commonly used to treat migraine. We assessed the efficacy of acupuncture at migraine-specific acupuncture points compared with other acupuncture points and sham acupuncture. Methods: We performed a multicentre, single-blind randomized controlled trial. In total, 480 patients with migraine were randomly assigned to one of four groups (Shaoyang-specific acupuncture, Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture, Yangming-specific acupuncture or sham acupuncture [control]). All groups received 20 treatments, which included electrical stimulation, over a period of four weeks. The primary outcome was the number of days with a migraine experienced during weeks 5-8 after randomization. Our secondary outcomes included the frequency of migraine attack, migraine intensity and migraine-specific quality of life. Results: Compared with patients in the control group, patients in the acupuncture groups reported fewer days with a migraine during weeks 5-8, however the differences between treatments were not significant (p &gt; 0.05). There was a significant reduction in the number of days with a migraine during weeks 13-16 in all acupuncture groups compared with control (Shaoyang-specific acupuncture v. control: difference -1.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.77 to -0.5], p = 0.003; Shaoyang-nonspecific acupuncture v. control: difference -1.22 [95% CI -1.92 to -0.52], p 0.001; Yangming-specific acupuncture v. control: difference -0.91 [95% CI -1.61 to -0.21], p = 0.011). We found that there was a significant, but not clinically relevant, benefit for almost all secondary outcomes in the three acupuncture groups compared with the control group. We found no relevant differences between the three acupuncture groups.

Search strategy: The Cochrane Pain, Palliative &amp; Supportive Care Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Trials Register were searched to January 2008. Selection criteria: We included randomized trials with a post-randomization observation period of at least 8 weeks that compared the clinical effects of an acupuncture intervention with a control (no prophylactic treatment or routine care only), a sham acupuncture intervention or another intervention in patients with migraine. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on patients, interventions, methods and results; and assessed risk of bias and quality of the acupuncture intervention. Outcomes extracted included response (outcome of primary interest), migraine attacks, migraine days, headache days and analgesic use. Pooled effect size estimates were calculated using a random-effects model. Main results: Twenty-two trials with 4419 participants (mean 201, median 42, range 27 to 1715) met the inclusion criteria. Six trials (including two large trials with 401 and 1715 patients) compared acupuncture to no prophylactic treatment or routine care only. After 3 to 4 months patients receiving acupuncture had higher response rates and fewer headaches. The only study with long-term follow up saw no evidence that effects dissipated up to 9 months after cessation of treatment. Fourteen trials compared a 'true' acupuncture intervention with a variety of sham interventions. Pooled analyses did not show a statistically significant superiority for true acupuncture for any outcome in any of the time windows, but the results of single trials varied considerably. Four trials compared acupuncture to proven prophylactic drug treatment. Overall in these trials acupuncture was associated with slightly better outcomes and fewer adverse effects than prophylactic drug treatment. Two small low-quality trials comparing acupuncture with relaxation (alone or in combination with massage) could not be interpreted reliably. Authors' conclusions: In the previous version of this review, evidence in support of acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis was considered promising but insufficient. Now, with 12 additional trials, there is consistent evidence that acupuncture provides additional benefit to treatment of acute migraine attacks only or to routine care. There is no evidence for an effect of 'true' acupuncture over sham interventions, though this is difficult to interpret, as exact point location could be of limited importance. Available studies suggest that acupuncture is at least as effective as, or possibly more effective than, prophylactic drug treatment, and has fewer adverse effects.

Participants: 150 acupuncture naive patients with episodic migraine without aura. Interventions: 20 sessions of manual acupuncture at true acupuncture points plus usual care, 20 sessions of non-penetrating sham acupuncture at heterosegmental non-acupuncture points plus usual care, or usual care alone over 8 weeks. Main outcome measures: Change in migraine days and migraine attacks per four weeks during weeks 1-20 after randomisation compared with baseline (four weeks before randomisation). Results: Among 150 randomised patients (mean age 36.5 (SD 11.4) years; 123 (82%) women), 147 were included in the full analysis set. Compared with sham acupuncture, manual acupuncture resulted in a significantly greater reduction in migraine days at weeks 13 to 20 and a significantly greater reduction in migraine attacks at weeks 17 to 20. The reduction in mean number of migraine days was 3.5 (SD 2.5) for manual versus 2.4 (3.4) for sham (adjusted difference -1.4, 95% confidence interval -2.4 to -0.3; P=0.005) at weeks 13 to 16 and 3.9 (3.0) for manual versus 2.2 (3.2) for sham (adjusted difference -2.1, -2.9 to -1.2; P 0.001) at weeks 17 to 20.

No severe adverse events were reported. No significant difference was seen in the proportion of patients perceiving needle penetration between manual acupuncture and sham acupuncture (79% v 75%; P=0.891). Conclusions: Twenty sessions of manual acupuncture was superior to sham acupuncture and usual care for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine without aura.

Background: Migraine prevalence is high and affects a relevant rate of adults in the productive phase of their life. Acupuncture has been increasingly advocated and used in Western countries for migraine treatment, but the evidence of its effectiveness still remains weak. A large variability of treatments is present in published studies and no acupoint selection according to TCM has been investigated so far; therefore, the low level of evidence of acupuncture effectiveness might partly depend on inappropriate treatment. Design and methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled study was performed in 160 patients suffering from migraine without aura, assessed according to the ICD-10 classification. The patients were divided into the following 4 groups: (1) group TA, treated with true acupuncture (according to TCM) plus Rizatriptan; (2) group RMA, treated with ritualized mock acupuncture plus Rizatriptan; (3) group SMA, treated with standard mock acupuncture plus Rizatriptan; (4) group R, without prophylactic treatment with relief therapy only (Rizatriptan). The MIDAS Questionnaire was administered before treatment (T0), at 3 (T1) and 6 months (T2) from the beginning of treatment, and the MIDAS Index (MI) was calculated. Rizatriptan intake was also checked in all groups of patients at T0, T1, and T2. Group TA and RMA were evaluated according to TCM as well; then, the former was submitted to true acupuncture and the latter to mock acupuncture treatment resembling the same as TA. The statistical analysis was conducted with factorial ANOVA and multiple tests with a Bonferroni adjustment. Results: A total of 127 patients completed the study (33 dropouts): 32 belonged to group TA, 30 to group RMA, 31 to group SMA, and 34 to group R. Before treatment the MI (T(0)) was moderate to severe with no significant intergroup differences. All groups underwent a decrease of MI at T(1) and T(2), with a significant group difference at both T(1) and T(2) compared to T(0) (P .0001). Only TA provided a significant improvement at both T(1) and T(2) compared to R (P .0001). RMA underwent a transient improvement of MI at T(1). The Rizatriptan intake paralleled the MI in all groups. Conclusions: TA was the only treatment able to provide a steady outcome improvement in comparison to the use of only Rizatriptan, while RMA showed a transient placebo effect at T1.",0.16567276418209076

5,2019,32269669,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,"Background: Migraine is a common neurological disease, which burdens individuals and society all over the world. Acupuncture, an important method in Traditional Chinese Medicine, is widely used in clinical practice as a treatment for migraine. Several systematic reviews (SRs) have investigated the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for migraine. Objective: To summarize and critically assess the quality of relevant SRs and present an objective and comprehensive evidence on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for migraine. Data Sources . MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, PROSPERO database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biological Medicine (CBM), China Science and Technology Journal (SCTJ), and WanFang database (WF) were searched from inception to December 2019 and grey literatures were manually searched. Selection Criteria . SRs which meet the criteria were independently selected by 2 reviewers according to a predetermined protocol. Data Extraction . Characteristics of included SRs were independently extracted by 2 reviewers following a predefined data extraction form. Review Appraisal . The methodological quality, risk of bias, and reporting quality of included SRs were assessed, respectively, by a Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2, the Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews (ROBIS) tool, and the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis-Acupuncture (PRISMA-A) statement. The quality of outcomes was evaluated by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Results: A total of 15 SRs were included. All the SRs were published between 2011-2019. Based on AMSTAR 2, 14 out of 15 SRs were rated critically low quality and 1 was rated low quality. According to ROBIS tool, 9 SRs (60%) were low risk of bias. With the PRISMA-A checklist, we found 11 out of 15 SRs were found adequately reported over 70%. With the GRADE tool, we found high quality of evidence indicated that the effective rate of acupuncture was superior to western medicine in treatment of migraine. Besides, acupuncture reduced more headache days and the times of using painkiller and was more effective in reducing the frequency and degree of headache than western medicine and sham acupuncture. Limitations . There might be some missing information. The accuracy of the conclusions may be decreased reduced since we were unable to synthesis all the evidence. Conclusions: Based on high quality of evidence, we concluded that acupuncture may be an effective and safe therapy for migraine. However, the quality of SRs in acupuncture for migraine still needs more improvement.",0.3454901874065399
5,2019,31872864,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,"Background: Standard pharmacological treatment of migraine has many shortcomings. Acupuncture is becoming a more widely used therapy for the prevention and treatment of migraine, but its effectiveness is still in question when compared to the pharmacological treatments even though very few of these have Class A and B evidence for migraine prevention. This is a systematic review of data from existing randomized trials that compare the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment with conventional migraine preventative medications. Methods: Custom-designed strategy was used for searching Pubmed (includes MEDLINE), Scopus (includes EMBASE). The inclusion criteria were English language and randomized trials. No date restriction was utilized. We included randomized trials and randomized controlled trials in adult patients that compared the clinical effects of acupuncture with a standard migraine preventive medication in patients with a diagnosis of chronic or episodic migraine with or without aura. We excluded letters and studies on acupuncture for headaches other than migraine. Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on patients, interventions, methods, and results; and assessed the quality of the acupuncture intervention based on the American Academy of Neurology Classification of evidence matrix for therapeutic trials. The present review was not registered. Results: Out of the 706 search results, 7 clinical trials, with a total of 1430 participants, met inclusion criteria for trials comparing the effectiveness of acupuncture to standard pharmacologic treatment. Several of the studies showed acupuncture to be more effective than standard pharmacological treatments for migraine prevention; however, methodological heterogeneity precluded aggregation of these data. Conclusions: There is growing evidence that acupuncture is just as effective and has fewer side effects than many of the standard pharmaceutical agents that are currently used. However, the heterogeneity of the existing studies limits the effective comparison and analysis.",0.27896633744239807

Methods: This study was a prospective, randomised, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled, clinical trial, undertaken between April 2002 and July 2005. Patients who had two to six migraine attacks per month were randomly assigned verum acupuncture (n=313), sham acupuncture (n=339), or standard therapy (n=308). Patients received ten sessions of acupuncture treatment in 6 weeks or continuous prophylaxis with drugs. Primary outcome was the difference in migraine days between 4 weeks before randomisation and weeks 23-26 after randomisation. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN52683557. Findings: Of 1295 patients screened, 960 were randomly assigned to a treatment group. Immediately after randomisation, 125 patients (106 from the standard group) withdrew their consent to study participation. 794 patients were analysed in the intention-to-treat popoulation and 443 in the per-protocol population. The primary outcome showed a mean reduction of 2 .3 days (95% CI 1.9-2.7) in the verum acupuncture group, 1.5 days (1.1-2.0) in the sham acupuncture group, and 2.1 days (1.5-2.7) in the standard therapy group. These differences were statistically significant compared with baseline (p 0.0001), but not across the treatment groups (p=0.09). The proportion of responders, defined as patients with a reduction of migraine days by at least 50%, 26 weeks after randomisation, was 47% in the verum group, 39% in the sham acupuncture group, and 40% in the standard group (p=0.133). Interpretation: Treatment outcomes for migraine do not differ between patients treated with sham acupuncture, verum acupuncture, or standard therapy.",0.15967276692390442

Amygdalin does not have the properties of a vitamin. Rats have been reared for several generations on diets devoid of cyanogenic glycosides, without developing neoplasms. Experiments with tumor-bearing rodents have demonstrated no curative properties by amygdalin administration. Amygdalin is not as non-toxic as claimed, particularly when ingested orally, and especially when taken with plant material high in beta-glucosidase. The claims for cure and control of cancers in humans have been refuted by distinguished physicians who specialize in the treatment of cancer patients.

In the 1920s, Dr. Ernst T. Krebs, Sr., formulated a theory that amygdalin could kill cancer cells. His theory was inconsistent with biochemical facts and has since been modified at least twice by his son, Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. Extensive work has been done by cancer scientists to test the claim that Laetrile fights cancer. Many animal experiments in the 1970s showed a complete lack of tumor killing by Laetrile. Reviews of the medical records of patients whose cancers were claimed to be reduced or cured after Laetrile treatment found insufficient medical evidence to judge Laetrile's efficacy. Finally, in a clinical trial in cancer patients reported in 1982, Laetrile neither caused shrinkage of tumors, nor increased survival time, nor alleviated cancer symptoms, nor enhanced well-being. Several reports in the medical literature document instances in which Laetrile has caused serious, life-threatening toxicity when taken in large doses in the manner prescribed by Laetrile advocates.

However, unlike stroke, treatment of hyperlipidemia with statin class drugs or treatment of blood clotting abnormalities with acetylsalicylic acid do not appear to have an effect on VaD incidence or progression. Pharmacological agents for treatment of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) such as memantine or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have small positive effects on cognition in VaD, which are likely due to their action on co-existing AD-related neuropathology. Drug development efforts using novel approaches such as patient stratification by their genotype are needed in order to address the increasing need for effective VaD therapeutics.",0.037761420011520386

Current patterns in the treatment of such dementias have not been studied. Objective: To determine the practice patterns of Canadian specialists for the treatment of subcortical vascular dementia, and to survey their opinions regarding issues which are important in the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in this field. Design: National survey of all specialists certified in Neurology or Geriatric Medicine. Results: Of responding physicians (78%) prescribed antithrombotic therapy for patients with vascular dementia. Most begin treatment with aspirin 325 mg daily (64%). The next three most common initial treatments were; no pharmacotherapy (12%), aspirin 650 mg daily (11%), and aspirin 1300 mg daily (11%). If the dementia continued to progress despite initial therapy, the treatment options were more varied. Most specialists (69%) believed that an RCT to assess the efficacy of aspirin in vascular dementia is warranted. The majority (69%) also felt that serial neuroimaging would be required for participants in such a trial, with magnetic resonance imaging being cited most frequently (41%). The majority of specialists considered three years as the minimum duration for such a trial. Conclusions: Specialist physician practice patterns vary significantly for the treatment of patients with subcortical vascular dementia. Most physicians believe that an RCT testing the efficacy of aspirin in this condition is required. However, before such a trial can be conducted, many methodological difficulties need to be addressed.",0.10055053979158401
7,2019,15224429,Can aspirin improve the lives of people with vascular dementia?,aspirin vascular dementia,0.0,"Vascular dementia is one of the most frequently occurring dementia syndromes. Its prevalence is about 5% among subjects above 85 years of age. Elevated blood pressure and atherosclerosis are the most important risk factors. According to international criteria, vascular dementia usually occurs within three months after having a stroke. However, the diagnosis can be difficult as some strokes are clinically 'silent' and may go unnoticed. Other factors may also contribute to the dementia syndrome, and concomitant depression may mask its clinical picture. In population studies, treatment of vascular risk factors is associated with a relatively low incidence of vascular dementia, but this effect has not been investigated in a randomized clinical trial. The value of acetylsalicylic acid in attenuating cognitive deterioration in patients with vascular dementia is uncertain. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may slow down cognitive decline not only in some patients with Alzheimer's disease but also in patients with vascular dementia.",0.044978752732276917
7,2019,12827329,Can aspirin improve the lives of people with vascular dementia?,aspirin vascular dementia,0.0,"Objective: It has been reported that aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) may protect against dementia of Alzheimer's type and/or vascular dementia. However, co-morbidity and the dose of aspirin may be critical. A major indication for low-dose aspirin is prophylaxis after stroke and transient ischaemic attacks, conditions that may obscure an anti-dementia effect by the drug. Alternatively, low-dose aspirin may be insufficient if the protective effect is due to an anti-inflammatory mechanism. The aim of this study was to assess whether high-dose or low-dose aspirin may protect against Alzheimer's dementia in subjects aged &gt; or =80 years. For comparison, effects of (other) NSAID, paracetamol and D-propoxyphene were studied. Methods: Global, cross-sectional, and longitudinal (1991-2000) epidemiological analyses of clinical, cognitive and drug treatment data on 702 individuals 80 years old or more (351 twin pairs of same sex), all alive at inclusion: mean age 83.9 years (80-99 years). Calculations were made with logistic regression of associations between use of various analgesics and cognitive function, after adjustment for age, gender, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Results: Users of high-dose aspirin had significantly lower prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia and better-maintained cognitive function than non-users. There were numerically similar but not significant associations with use of low-dose aspirin and other NSAID. There were no such associations with use of either paracetamol or D-propoxyphene. Conclusion: Aspirin might protect against Alzheimer's disease, but controlled trials are warranted.",0.04809342697262764
8,2019,12076414,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,"Background: : Jet-lag commonly affects air travellers who cross several time zones. It results from the body's internal rhythms being out of step with the day-night cycle at the destination. Melatonin is a pineal hormone that plays a central part in regulating bodily rhythms and has been used as a drug to re-align them with the outside world. Objectives: : To assess the effectiveness of oral melatonin taken in different dosage regimens for alleviating jet-lag after air travel across several time zones. Search strategy: : We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit and Science Citation Index electronically, and the journals 'Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine' and 'Sleep' by hand. We searched citation lists of relevant studies for other relevant trials. We asked principal authors of relevant studies to tell us about unpublished trials. Reports of adverse events linked to melatonin use outside randomised trials were searched for systematically in 'Side Effects of Drugs' (SED) and SED Annuals, 'Reactions Weekly', MEDLINE, and the adverse drug reactions databases of the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) and the US Food &amp; Drug Administration. Selection criteria: : Randomised trials in airline passengers, airline staff or military personnel given oral melatonin, compared with placebo or other medication. Outcome measures should consist of subjective rating of jet-lag or related components, such as subjective wellbeing, daytime tiredness, onset and quality of sleep, psychological functioning, duration of return to normal, or indicators of circadian rhythms. Data collection and analysis: : Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. All compared melatonin with placebo; one in addition compared it with a hypnotic, zolpidem. Nine of the trials were of adequate quality to contribute to the assessment, one had a design fault and could not be used in the assessment. Reports of adverse events outside trials were found through MEDLINE, 'Reactions Weekly', and in the WHO UMC database. Main results: : Nine of the ten trials found that melatonin, taken close to the target bedtime at the destination (10pm to midnight), decreased jet-lag from flights crossing five or more time zones. Daily doses of melatonin between 0.5 and 5mg are similarly effective, except that people fall asleep faster and sleep better after 5mg than 0.5mg. Doses above 5mg appear to be no more effective. The relative ineffectiveness of 2mg slow-release melatonin suggests that a short-lived higher peak concentration of melatonin works better. Based on the review, the number needed to treat (NNT) is 2. The benefit is likely to be greater the more time zones are crossed, and less for westward flights. The timing of the melatonin dose is important: if it is taken at the wrong time, early in the day, it is liable to cause sleepiness and delay adaptation to local time. The incidence of other side effects is low. Case reports suggest that people with epilepsy, and patients taking warfarin may come to harm from melatonin. Reviewer's conclusions: : Melatonin is remarkably effective in preventing or reducing jet-lag, and occasional short-term use appears to be safe. It should be recommended to adult travellers flying across five or more time zones, particularly in an easterly direction, and especially if they have experienced jet-lag on previous journeys. Travellers crossing 2-4 time zones can also use it if need be. The pharmacology and toxicology of melatonin needs systematic study, and routine pharmaceutical quality control of melatonin products must be established. The effects of melatonin in people with epilepsy, and a possible interaction with warfarin, need investigation.",0.3141407370567322

The objective of the study was to examine the effects of oral melatonin in alleviating jet-lag by investigating its effects on subjects who had flown from London to Eastern Australia, 10 time-zones to the east. Melatonin (5 mg day(-1)) or placebo capsules were administered to 14 experimental (13 males and 1 female) and 17 control subjects (15 males and 2 females), respectively, in a double-blind study; the time of administration was in accord with the current consensus for maximizing its hypnotic effect. Grip strength and intra-aural temperature were measured on alternate days after arrival at the destination, at four different times of day (between the times 07:00 - 08:00 h, 12:00 - 13:00 h, 16:00 - 17:00 h and 19:00 - 20:00 h local time). In addition, for the first 6 - 7 days after arrival in Australia, subjective ratings of jet-lag on a 0 - 10 visual analogue scale and responses to a Jet-lag Questionnaire (incorporating items for tiredness. sleep, meal satisfaction and ability to concentrate) were recorded at the above times and also on retiring (at about midnight). Subjects continued normally with their work schedules between the data collection times. Subjects with complete data (13 melatonin and 13 placebo subjects), in comparison with published data, showed partial adjustment of the diurnal rhythm in intra-aural temperature after 6 days. A time-of-day effect was evident in both right and left grip strength during adjustment to Australian time; there was no difference between the group taking melatonin and that using the placebo. Right and left grip strength profiles on day 6 were adjusted either by advancing or delaying the profiles, independent of whether subjects were taking melatonin or placebo tablets. Subjects reported disturbances with most measures in the Jet-lag Questionnaire but, whereas poorer concentration and some negative effects upon sleep had disappeared after 3 - 5 days, ratings of jet-lag and tiredness had not returned to 'zero' (or normal values), respectively, by the sixth day of the study. Subjects taking melatonin showed no significant differences from the placebo group in perceived irritability, concentration, meal satisfaction, ease in getting to sleep and staying asleep, frequency of bowel motion and consistency of the faeces. These results suggest that, in subjects who, after arrival, followed a busy schedule which resulted in frequent and erratic exposure to daylight, melatonin had no benefit in alleviating jet-lag or the components of jet-lag, and it did not influence the process of phase adjustment.",0.29618561267852783
8,2019,26731279,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,"Jet lag syndrome is an exogenous circadian rhythm sleep disorder, frequently reported in travelers who cross multiple time zones in a short period of time. Oral melatonin -a pineal neurohormone normally produced during darkness and responsible for regulating the body's circadian rhythms- has been used as treatment for this condition. Searching in Epistemonikos database, which is maintained by screening 30 databases, we identified four systematic reviews including 11 randomized trials. We combined the evidence using meta-analysis and generated a summary of findings table following the GRADE approach. We concluded the use of oral melatonin probably reduces symptoms associated with jet lag syndrome.

8,2019,18342269,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,"Each year millions of travelers undertake long distance flights over one or more continents. These multiple time zone flights produce a constellation of symptoms known as jet lag. Familiar to almost every intercontinental traveler is the experience of fatigue upon arrival in a new time zone, but almost as problematic are a number of other jet lag symptoms. These include reduced alertness, nighttime insomnia, loss of appetite, depressed mood, poor psychomotor coordination and reduced cognitive skills, all symptoms which are closely affected by both the length and direction of travel. The most important jet lag symptoms are due to disruptions to the body's sleep/wake cycle. Clinical and pathophysiological studies also indicate that jet lag can exacerbate existing affective disorders. It has been suggested that dysregulation of melatonin secretion and occurrence of circadian rhythm disturbances may be the common links which underlie jet lag and affective disorders. Largely because of its regulatory effects on the circadian system, melatonin has proven to be highly effective for treating the range of symptoms that accompany transmeridian air travel. Additionally, it has been found to be of value in treating mood disorders like seasonal affective disorder. Melatonin acts on MT(1) and MT(2) melatonin receptors located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei, the site of the body's master circadian clock. Melatonin resets disturbed circadian rhythms and promotes sleep in jet lag and other circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including delayed sleep phase syndrome and shift-work disorder. Although post-flight melatonin administration works efficiently in transmeridian flights across less than 7-8 times zones, in the case longer distances, melatonin should be given by 2-3 days in advance to the flight. To deal with the unwanted side effects which usually accompany this pre-departure treatment (acute soporific and sedative effects in times that may not be wanted), the suppression of circadian rhythmicity by covering symmetrically the phase delay and the phase advance portions of the phase response curve for light, together with the administration of melatonin at local bedtime to resynchronize the circadian oscillator, have been proposed. The current view that sleep loss is a major cause of jet lag has focused interest on two recently developed pharmacological agents. Ramelteon and agomelatine are melatonin receptor agonists which, compared to melatonin itself, have a longer half-life and greater affinity for melatonin receptors and consequently are thought to hold promise for treating a variety of circadian disruptions.",0.43286189436912537
8,2019,9406036,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,"Melatonin has chronobiotic properties in humans. It is able to phase shift strongly endogenous rhythms, such as core temperature and its own endogenous rhythm, together with the sleep-wake cycle. Its ability to synchronize free-running rhythms has not been fully investigated in humans. There is evidence for synchronization of the sleep-wake cycle, but the available data suggest that it is less effective with regard to endogenous melatonin and core temperature rhythms. When suitably timed, most studies indicate that fast release preparations are able to hasten adaptation to phase shift in both field and simulation studies of jet lag and shift work. Both subjective and objective measures support this statement. However, not all studies have been successful. Careful evaluation of the effects on work-related performance is required. When used to alleviate the non-24-h sleep-wake disorder in blind subjects, again most studies report a successful outcome using behavioral measures, albeit in a small number of individuals. The present data suggest, however, that although sleep-wake can be stabilized to 24 h, entrainment of other rhythms is exceptionally rare.",0.1944175362586975
8,2019,20827520,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,"Traveling through several time zones results in a constellation of symptoms known as jet lag. These include reduced alertness, daytime fatigue, loss of appetite, reduced cognitive skills, and disruption of the sleep/wake cycle. In susceptible air travel passengers, jet lag may exacerbate affective illness and result in psychiatric morbidity. Dysregulation of circadian rhythms and melatonin secretion represent the common underlying factor in jet lag and other circadian disorders. Recent studies have established the effectiveness of strategically timed administration of melatonin and appropriate timed exposure to environmental schedules including light in counteracting the dysregulation (chronobiologic actions). With the introduction of melatonergic agonists such as ramelteon and tasimelteon, which have both a stronger affinity for MT₁ and MT₂ melatonin receptors and a longer half-life, new therapeutic options now exist for treating the sleep disturbances associated with jet lag. The melatonin analogs are unique inasmuch as they can also enhance daytime alertness. The recently introduced melatonergic antidepressant agomelatine, which has established its supremacy over other antidepressants in having a significant chronobiologic activity, represents a good choice for treating depressive symptoms that are associated with jet lag.",0.5929891467094421
8,2019,10484950,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,"Objective: The goals of this study were to validate a new rating scale for measuring severity of jet lag and to compare the efficacy of contrasting melatonin regimens to alleviate jet lag. Method: This was a randomized, double-blind trial of placebo and three alternative regimens of melatonin (5.0 mg at bedtime, 0.5 mg at bedtime, and 0.5 mg taken on a shifting schedule) for jet lag. The subjects were 257 Norwegian physicians who had visited New York for 5 days. Jet lag ratings were made on the day of travel from New York back to Oslo (6 hours eastward) and for the next 6 days in Norway. The main outcome measures were scale and item scores from a new, syndrome-specific instrument, the Columbia Jet Lag Scale, that identifies prominent daytime symptoms of jet lag distress. Results: There was a marked increase in total jet lag score in all four treatment groups on the first day at home, followed by progressive improvement over the next 5 days. However, there were no significant group differences or group-by-time interactions. In addition, there was no group effect for sleep onset, time of awakening, hours slept, or hours napping. Ratings on a summary jet lag item were highly correlated with total jet lag scores (from a low of r = 0.54 on the day of travel to a high of r = 0.80 on day 3). The internal consistency of the total jet lag score was high on each day of the study. Conclusions: The use of melatonin for preventing jet lag needs further study.",0.0854288712143898

Methods: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study is based on 137 volunteers flying from Switzerland to the American continent and back (6-9 time zones). The participants either received melatonin 5 mg (n = 35), zolpidem 10 mg (n = 34), a combination thereof (n = 29) or placebo (n = 39) on the eastbound flight back to Switzerland and once daily at bedtime on 4 consecutive days after the flight. The test battery included daily sleep logs, symptoms questionnaires, and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Also, on the last treatment day, Visual Analog Scales (VAS) were completed to assess overall jet lag ratings and treatment effectiveness. Baseline data were collected on 4 consecutive days 2 wk after the flight. During post-flight treatment and baseline, motor activity was assessed in a subgroup of 49 subjects using wrist-worn ambulatory monitors. Results: The self-rated sleep quality was significantly improved by zolpidem, especially during the night flight. Subjects taking zolpidem reported significantly less jet lag and zolpidem was rated as the most effective jet lag medication. However, zolpidem and the combination melatonin/zolpidem were less well tolerated than melatonin alone; adverse event reports included nausea, vomiting, amnesia and somnambulia to the point of incapacitation. Confusion, morning sleepiness and nausea were highest in the combination group. Conclusions: All active treatments led to a decrease of jet lag severity with zolpidem being the most effective treatment, particularly in facilitating sleep on night flights.

Daily ratings showed a trend in jet lag, mood, and sleepiness measures toward an improved recovery in the late melatonin group and a worse recovery in the early melatonin group as compared to placebo. Retrospective ratings made 6 days after arrival showed the late melatonin group reported significantly less jet lag and sleep disturbance following the flight compared to placebo.

11,2019,14749199,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,"Background context: Exercise is a widely prescribed treatment for chronic low back pain, with demonstrated effectiveness for improving function and work. Purpose: The goal of this article is to review several key aspects about the safety and efficacy of exercise that may help clinicians understand its utility in treating chronic back pain. Study design/setting: A computerized literature search of MEDLINE was conducted using ""exercise,"" ""fitness,"" ""back pain,"" ""backache"" and ""rehabilitation"" as search words. Identified abstracts were scanned, and useful articles were acquired for further review. Additional references were acquired through the personal collections of research papers possessed by the authors and by reviewing prior review articles on this subject. These final papers were scrutinized for data relevant to the key aspects about exercise covered in this article. Results: For people with acute, subacute or chronic low back pain, there is no evidence that exercise increases the risk of additional back problems or work disability. To the contrary, current medical literature suggests that exercise has either a neutral effect or may slightly reduce risk of future back injuries. Exercise can be prescribed for patients with chronic low back pain with three distinct goals. The first and most obvious goal is to improve or eliminate impairments in back flexibility and strength, and improve performance of endurance activities. There is a large body of evidence confirming that this goal can be accomplished for a majority of patients with chronic low back pain. The second goal of exercise is to reduce the intensity of back pain. Most studies of exercise have noted overall reduction in back pain intensity that ranges from 10% to 50% after exercise treatment. The third goal of exercise is to reduce back pain-related disability through a process of desensitization of fears and concerns, altering pain attitudes and beliefs and improving affect. The mechanisms through which exercise can accomplish this goal have been the subject of substantial research. Conclusions: Exercise is safe for individuals with back pain, because it does not increase the risk of future back injuries or work absence. Substantial evidence exists supporting the use of exercise as a therapeutic tool to improve impairments in back flexibility and strength. Most studies have observed improvements in global pain ratings after exercise programs, and many have observed that exercise can lessen the behavioral, cognitive, affect and disability aspects of back pain syndromes.",0.5116214752197266

Design: Systematic review with network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Participants: Adults with non-specific low back pain for ≥ 12 weeks. Intervention: Exercise treatments prescribed or planned by a health professional that involved conducting specific activities, postures and/or movements with a goal to improve low back pain outcomes. Outcome measures: Pain intensity (eg, visual analogue scale or numerical rating scale) and back-related functional limitations (eg, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire or Oswestry Disability Index), each standardised to range from 0 to 100. Results: This review included 217 randomised controlled trials with 20,969 participants and 507 treatment groups. Most exercise types were more effective than minimal treatment for pain and functional limitation outcomes. Network meta-analysis results were compatible with moderate to clinically important treatment effects for Pilates, McKenzie therapy, and functional restoration (pain only) and flexibility exercises (function only) compared with minimal treatment, other effective treatments and other exercise types. The estimated mean differences for these exercise types compared with minimal treatment ranged from -15 to -19 for pain and from -10 to -12 for functional limitation. Conclusion: This review found evidence that Pilates, McKenzie therapy and functional restoration were more effective than other types of exercise treatment for reducing pain intensity and functional limitations. Nevertheless, people with chronic low back pain should be encouraged to perform the exercise that they enjoy to promote adherence. Registration: DOI:10.1002/14651858.CD009790.",0.4931769073009491
11,2019,25488399,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,"Background: Non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) is a large and costly problem. It has a lifetime prevalence of 80% and results in high levels of healthcare cost. It is a major cause for long term sickness amongst the workforce and is associated with high levels of fear avoidance and kinesiophobia. Stabilisation (or 'core stability') exercises have been suggested to reduce symptoms of pain and disability and form an effective treatment. Despite it being the most commonly used form of physiotherapy treatment within the UK there is a lack of positive evidence to support its use. The aims of this systematic review update is to investigate the effectiveness of stabilisation exercises for the treatment of NSLBP, and compare any effectiveness to other forms of exercise. Methods: A systematic review published in 2008 was updated with a search of PubMed, CINAHL, AMED, Pedro and The Cochrane Library, October 2006 to October 2013. Two authors independently selected studies, and two authors independently extracted the data. Methodological quality was evaluated using the PEDro scale. Meta-analysis was carried out when appropriate. Results: 29 studies were included: 22 studies (n = 2,258) provided post treatment effect on pain and 24 studies (n = 2,359) provided post treatment effect on disability. Pain and disability scores were transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. Meta-analysis showed significant benefit for stabilisation exercises versus any alternative treatment or control for long term pain and disability with mean difference of -6.39 (95% CI -10.14 to -2.65) and -3.92 (95% CI -7.25 to -0.59) respectively. The difference between groups was clinically insignificant. When compared with alternative forms of exercise, there was no statistical or clinically significant difference. Mean difference for pain was -3.06 (95% CI -6.74 to 0.63) and disability -1.89 (95% CI -5.10 to 1.33). Conclusion: There is strong evidence stabilisation exercises are not more effective than any other form of active exercise in the long term. The low levels of heterogeneity and large number of high methodological quality of available studies, at long term follow-up, strengthen our current findings, and further research is unlikely to considerably alter this conclusion.",0.3856794834136963
11,2019,15867409,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,"Background: Exercise therapy is widely used as an intervention in low back pain. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise therapy in adult nonspecific acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain versus no treatment and other conservative treatments. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases to October 2004; citation searches and bibliographic reviews of previous systematic reviews. Study selection: Randomized, controlled trials evaluating exercise therapy for adult nonspecific low back pain and measuring pain, function, return to work or absenteeism, and global improvement outcomes. Data extraction: Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data on study characteristics, quality, and outcomes at short-, intermediate-, and long-term follow-up. Data synthesis: 61 randomized, controlled trials (6390 participants) met inclusion criteria: acute (11 trials), subacute (6 trials), and chronic (43 trials) low back pain (1 trial was unclear). Evidence suggests that exercise therapy is effective in chronic back pain relative to comparisons at all follow-up periods. Pooled mean improvement (of 100 points) was 7.3 points (95% CI, 3.7 to 10.9 points) for pain and 2.5 points (CI, 1.0 to 3.9 points) for function at earliest follow-up. In studies investigating patients (people seeking care for back pain), mean improvement was 13.3 points (CI, 5.5 to 21.1 points) for pain and 6.9 points (CI, 2.2 to 11.7 points) for function, compared with studies where some participants had been recruited from a general population (for example, with advertisements). Some evidence suggests effectiveness of a graded-activity exercise program in subacute low back pain in occupational settings, although the evidence for other types of exercise therapy in other populations is inconsistent. In acute low back pain, exercise therapy and other programs were equally effective (pain, 0.03 point [CI, -1.3 to 1.4 points]). Limitations: Limitations of the literature, including low-quality studies with heterogeneous outcome measures inconsistent and poor reporting, and possibility of publication bias. Conclusions: Exercise therapy seems to be slightly effective at decreasing pain and improving function in adults with chronic low back pain, particularly in health care populations. In subacute low back pain populations, some evidence suggests that a graded-activity program improves absenteeism outcomes, although evidence for other types of exercise is unclear. In acute low back pain populations, exercise therapy is as effective as either no treatment or other conservative treatments.",0.260451078414917
11,2019,26863390,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,"Background: Motor control exercise (MCE) is used by healthcare professionals worldwide as a common treatment for low back pain (LBP). However, the effectiveness of this intervention for acute LBP remains unclear. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of MCE for patients with acute non-specific LBP. Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), four other databases and two trial registers from their inception to April 2015, tracked citations and searched reference lists. We placed no limitations on language nor on publication status. Selection criteria: We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effectiveness of MCE for patients with acute non-specific LBP. We considered trials comparing MCE versus no treatment, versus another type of treatment or added as a supplement to other interventions. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability. Secondary outcomes were function, quality of life and recurrence. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors screened for potentially eligible studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. A third independent review author resolved disagreements. We examined MCE in the following comparisons: (1) MCE versus spinal manipulative therapy; (2) MCE versus other exercises; and (3) MCE as a supplement to medical management. We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to assess the quality of evidence. For missing or unclear information, we contacted study authors. We considered the following follow-up intervals: short term (less than three months after randomisation); intermediate term (at least three months but within 12 months after randomisation); and long term (12 months or longer after randomisation). Main results: We included three trials in this review (n = 197 participants). Study sample sizes ranged from 33 to 123 participants. Low-quality evidence indicates no clinically important differences between MCE and spinal manipulative therapy for pain at short term and for disability at short term and long term. Low-quality evidence also suggests no clinically important differences between MCE and other forms of exercise for pain at short or intermediate term and for disability at intermediate term or long term follow-up. Moderate-quality evidence shows no clinically important differences between MCE and other forms of exercise for disability at short term follow-up. Finally, very low-quality evidence indicates that addition of MCE to medical management does not provide clinically important improvement for pain or disability at short term follow-up. For recurrence at one year, very low-quality evidence suggests that MCE and medical management decrease the risk of recurrence by 64% compared with medical management alone. Authors' conclusions: We identified only three small trials that also evaluated different comparisons; therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the effectiveness of MCE for acute LBP. Evidence of very low to moderate quality indicates that MCE showed no benefit over spinal manipulative therapy, other forms of exercise or medical treatment in decreasing pain and disability among patients with acute and subacute low back pain.

11,2019,25299528,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,"Objective: A meta-analysis of relevant cohort studies was performed to investigate the efficacy of aerobic exercise for the treatment of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Method: A range of electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE (1966-2013), the Cochrane Library Database (issue 12, 2013), EMBASE (1980-2013), CINAHL (1982-2013), Web of Science (1945~2013), and the Chinese Biomedical Database (1982-2013), without language restrictions. The Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, the McGill Pain Questionnaire, visual analog scale, and heart rate, sit-and-reach test, and maximum oxygen consumption were used to evaluate the efficacy of aerobic exercise. Meta-analysis was performed with the use of the STATA statistical software. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Eight clinical cohort studies with a total of 310 CLBP patients were included in the meta-analysis. Results: The results of this meta-analysis indicated that CLBP patients exhibited positive decreases in scores on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (SMD, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.68; P 0.001), Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (SMD, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.67-1.39; P 0.001), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (SMD, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.34-2.37; P = 0.009), and McGill Pain Questionnaire (SMD, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.07-0.56; P = 0.011) after aerobic exercise. It was also observed that aerobic exercise could markedly reduce the visual analog scale score for pain of CLBP patients (SMD, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.48-1.02; P 0.001). Nevertheless, this study's findings showed that aerobic exercise had no effects on heart rate, sit-and-reach test, and maximum oxygen consumption of CLBP patients (all P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: The current meta-analysis provides reliable evidence that aerobic exercise could effectively diminish pain intensity and improve the physical and psychologic functioning of CLBP patients. Thus, aerobic exercise may be a good choice in the treatment for CLBP.",0.4794582724571228
11,2019,27128390,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,"Study design: A systematic review. Objective: The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of motor control exercise (MCE) in patients with nonspecific low back pain (LBP). Summary of background data: MCE is a common form of exercise used for managing LBP. MCE focuses on the activation of the deep trunk muscles and targets the restoration of control and coordination of these muscles, progressing to more complex and functional tasks integrating the activation of deep and global trunk muscles. Methods: We conducted electronic searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, five other databases, and two trials registers from their inception up to April 2015. Two independent review authors screened the search results, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data. A third reviewer resolved any disagreement. We included randomized controlled trials comparing MCE with no treatment, another treatment, or as a supplement to other interventions in patients with nonspecific LBP. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Back and Neck (CBN) Review Group 12-item criteria. We combined results in a meta-analysis expressed as mean difference and 95% confidence interval. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Results: We included 32 trials (n = 2628). Most included trials had a low risk of bias. For acute LBP, low to moderate quality evidence indicates no clinically important differences between MCE and spinal manipulative therapy or other forms of exercise. There is very low-quality evidence that the addition of MCE to medical management does not provide clinically important improvements. For recurrence at one year, there is very low-quality evidence that MCE and medical management decrease the risk of recurrence. For chronic LBP, there is low to moderate quality evidence that MCE is effective for reducing pain compared with minimal intervention. There is low to high-quality evidence that MCE is not clinically more effective than other exercises or manual therapy. There is very low to low quality evidence that MCE is clinically more effective than exercise and electrophysical agents (EPAs) or telerehabilitation for pain and disability. Conclusion: MCE is probably more effective than a minimal intervention for reducing pain, but probably does not have an important effect on disability, in patients with chronic LBP. There was no clinically important difference between MCE and other forms of exercises or manual therapy for acute and chronic LBP. Level of evidence: 1.",0.34236612915992737
11,2019,34580864,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,"Background: Low back pain has been the leading cause of disability globally for at least the past three decades and results in enormous direct healthcare and lost productivity costs. Objectives: The primary objective of this systematic review is to assess the impact of exercise treatment on pain and functional limitations in adults with chronic non-specific low back pain compared to no treatment, usual care, placebo and other conservative treatments. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (which includes the Cochrane Back and Neck trials register), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, and trials registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), and conducted citation searching of relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies. The review includes data for trials identified in searches up to 27 April 2018. All eligible trials have been identified through searches to 7 December 2020, but have not yet been extracted; these trials will be integrated in the next update. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials that assessed exercise treatment compared to no treatment, usual care, placebo or other conservative treatment on the outcomes of pain or functional limitations for a population of adult participants with chronic non-specific low back pain of more than 12 weeks' duration. Data collection and analysis: Two authors screened and assessed studies independently, with consensus. We extracted outcome data using electronic databases; pain and functional limitations outcomes were re-scaled to 0 to 100 points for meta-analyses where 0 is no pain or functional limitations. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool and used GRADE to evaluate the overall certainty of the evidence. When required, we contacted study authors to obtain missing data. To interpret meta-analysis results, we considered a 15-point difference in pain and a 10-point difference in functional limitations outcomes to be clinically important for the primary comparison of exercise versus no treatment, usual care or placebo. Main results: We included 249 trials of exercise treatment, including studies conducted in Europe (122 studies), Asia (38 studies), North America (33 studies), and the Middle East (24 studies). Sixty-one per cent of studies (151 trials) examined the effectiveness of two or more different types of exercise treatment, and 57% (142 trials) compared exercise treatment to a non-exercise comparison treatment. Study participants had a mean age of 43.7 years and, on average, 59% of study populations were female. Most of the trials were judged to be at risk of bias, including 79% at risk of performance bias due to difficulty blinding exercise treatments. We found moderate-certainty evidence that exercise treatment is more effective for treatment of chronic low back pain compared to no treatment, usual care or placebo comparisons for pain outcomes at earliest follow-up (MD -15.2, 95% CI -18.3 to -12.2), a clinically important difference. Certainty of evidence was downgraded mainly due to heterogeneity. For the same comparison, there was moderate-certainty evidence for functional limitations outcomes (MD -6.8 (95% CI -8.3 to -5.3); this finding did not meet our prespecified threshold for minimal clinically important difference. Certainty of evidence was downgraded mainly due to some evidence of publication bias. Compared to all other investigated conservative treatments, exercise treatment was found to have improved pain (MD -9.1, 95% CI -12.6 to -5.6) and functional limitations outcomes (MD -4.1, 95% CI -6.0 to -2.2). These effects did not meet our prespecified threshold for clinically important difference. Subgroup analysis of pain outcomes suggested that exercise treatment is probably more effective than education alone (MD -12.2, 95% CI -19.4 to -5.0) or non-exercise physical therapy (MD -10.4, 95% CI -15.2 to -5.6), but with no differences observed for manual therapy (MD 1.0, 95% CI -3.1 to 5.1). In studies that reported adverse effects (86 studies), one or more adverse effects were reported in 37 of 112 exercise groups (33%) and 12 of 42 comparison groups (29%). Twelve included studies reported measuring adverse effects in a systematic way, with a median of 0.14 (IQR 0.01 to 0.57) per participant in the exercise groups (mostly minor harms, e.g. muscle soreness), and 0.12 (IQR 0.02 to 0.32) in comparison groups. Authors' conclusions: We found moderate-certainty evidence that exercise is probably effective for treatment of chronic low back pain compared to no treatment, usual care or placebo for pain. The observed treatment effect for the exercise compared to no treatment, usual care or placebo comparisons is small for functional limitations, not meeting our threshold for minimal clinically important difference. We also found exercise to have improved pain (low-certainty evidence) and functional limitations outcomes (moderate-certainty evidence) compared to other conservative treatments; however, these effects were small and not clinically important when considering all comparisons together. Subgroup analysis suggested that exercise treatment is probably more effective than advice or education alone, or electrotherapy, but with no differences observed for manual therapy treatments.",0.2872449457645416

Data sources: A search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO and The Cochrane Library was conducted up to October 2014. Review methods: Databases were searched for published reports of randomised trials that investigated the treatment of chronic low back pain of non-specific origin with an exercise intervention. Two authors independently reviewed and selected relevant trials. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Downs and Black tool. Results: Forty-five trials met the inclusion criteria and thirty-nine were included in the meta-analysis. Combined meta-analysis revealed significantly lower chronic low back pain with intervention groups using exercise compared to a control group or other treatment group (Standard Mean Deviation (SMD) =-0.32, CI 95% -0.44 to -0.19, P 0.01). Separate exploratory subgroup analysis showed a significant effect for strength/resistance and coordination/stabilisation programs.

11,2019,29525763,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,"Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-utility of the addition of different doses of Pilates to an advice for non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) from a societal perspective. Design: Randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation. Setting: Physiotherapy clinic in São Paulo, Brazil. Participants: 296 patients with NSCLBP. Interventions: All patients received advice and were randomly allocated to four groups (n=74 per group): booklet group (BG), Pilates once a week (Pilates group 1, PG1), Pilates twice a week (Pilates group 2, PG2) and Pilates three times a week (Pilates group 3, PG3). Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes were pain and disability at 6-week follow-up. Results: Compared with the BG, all Pilates groups showed significant improvements in pain (PG1, mean difference (MD)=-1.2, 95% CI -2.2 to -0.3; PG2, MD=-2.3, 95% CI -3.2 to -1.4; PG3, MD=-2.1, 95% CI -3.0 to -1.1) and disability (PG1, MD=-1.9, 95% CI -3.6 to -0.1; PG2, MD=-4.7, 95% CI -6.4 to -3.0; PG3, MD=-3.3, 95% CI -5.0 to -1.6). Among the different doses, PG2 showed significant improvements in comparison with PG1 for pain (MD=-1.1, 95% CI -2.0 to -0.1) and disability (MD=-2.8, 95% CI -4.5 to -1.1). The cost-utility analysis showed that PG3 had a 0.78 probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Conclusions: Adding two sessions of Pilates exercises to advice provided better outcomes in pain and disability than advice alone for patients with NSCLBP; non-specific elements such as greater attention or expectation might be part of this effect. The cost-utility analysis showed that Pilates three times a week was the preferred option.

Our aim was to determine whether male circumcision had a protective effect against HIV infection, and to assess safety and changes in sexual behaviour related to this intervention. Methods: We did a randomised controlled trial of 2784 men aged 18-24 years in Kisumu, Kenya. Men were randomly assigned to an intervention group (circumcision; n=1391) or a control group (delayed circumcision, 1393), and assessed by HIV testing, medical examinations, and behavioural interviews during follow-ups at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. HIV seroincidence was estimated in an intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, with the number <a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00059371"" title=""See in ClinicalTrials.gov"">NCT00059371</a>. Findings: The trial was stopped early on December 12, 2006, after a third interim analysis reviewed by the data and safety monitoring board. The median length of follow-up was 24 months. Follow-up for HIV status was incomplete for 240 (8.6%) participants. 22 men in the intervention group and 47 in the control group had tested positive for HIV when the study was stopped. The 2-year HIV incidence was 2.1% (95% CI 1.2-3.0) in the circumcision group and 4.2% (3.0-5.4) in the control group (p=0.0065); the relative risk of HIV infection in circumcised men was 0.47 (0.28-0.78), which corresponds to a reduction in the risk of acquiring an HIV infection of 53% (22-72). Adjusting for non-adherence to treatment and excluding four men found to be seropositive at enrollment, the protective effect of circumcision was 60% (32-77). Adverse events related to the intervention (21 events in 1.5% of those circumcised) resolved quickly. No behavioural risk compensation after circumcision was observed. Interpretation: Male circumcision significantly reduces the risk of HIV acquisition in young men in Africa. Where appropriate, voluntary, safe, and affordable circumcision services should be integrated with other HIV preventive interventions and provided as expeditiously as possible.",0.22753411531448364

Men were randomly assigned to receive immediate circumcision (n=2474) or circumcision delayed for 24 months (2522). HIV testing, physical examination, and interviews were repeated at 6, 12, and 24 month follow-up visits. The primary outcome was HIV incidence.

Findings: Baseline characteristics of the men in the intervention and control groups were much the same at enrollment. Retention rates were much the same in the two groups, with 90-92% of participants retained at all time points. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, HIV incidence over 24 months was 0.66 cases per 100 person-years in the intervention group and 1.33 cases per 100 person-years in the control group (estimated efficacy of intervention 51%, 95% CI 16-72; p=0.006). The as-treated efficacy was 55% (95% CI 22-75; p=0.002); efficacy from the Kaplan-Meier time-to-HIV-detection as-treated analysis was 60% (30-77; p=0.003). HIV incidence was lower in the intervention group than it was in the control group in all sociodemographic, behavioural, and sexually transmitted disease symptom subgroups. Moderate or severe adverse events occurred in 84 (3.6%) circumcisions; all resolved with treatment. Behaviours were much the same in both groups during follow-up.

12,2019,19616720,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"Background: Observational studies have reported an association between male circumcision and reduced risk of HIV infection in female partners. We assessed whether circumcision in HIV-infected men would reduce transmission of the virus to female sexual partners. Methods: 922 uncircumcised, HIV-infected, asymptomatic men aged 15-49 years with CD4-cell counts 350 cells per microL or more were enrolled in this unblinded, randomised controlled trial in Rakai District, Uganda. Men were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive immediate circumcision (intervention; n=474) or circumcision delayed for 24 months (control; n=448). HIV-uninfected female partners of the randomised men were concurrently enrolled (intervention, n=93; control, n=70) and followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months, to assess HIV acquisition by male treatment assignment (primary outcome). A modified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, which included all concurrently enrolled couples in which the female partner had at least one follow-up visit over 24 months, assessed female HIV acquisition by use of survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling.

12,2019,16231970,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"Background: Observational studies suggest that male circumcision may provide protection against HIV-1 infection. A randomized, controlled intervention trial was conducted in a general population of South Africa to test this hypothesis. Methods and findings: A total of 3,274 uncircumcised men, aged 18-24 y, were randomized to a control or an intervention group with follow-up visits at months 3, 12, and 21. Male circumcision was offered to the intervention group immediately after randomization and to the control group at the end of the follow-up. The grouped censored data were analyzed in intention-to-treat, univariate and multivariate, analyses, using piecewise exponential, proportional hazards models. Rate ratios (RR) of HIV incidence were determined with 95% CI. Protection against HIV infection was calculated as 1 - RR. The trial was stopped at the interim analysis, and the mean (interquartile range) follow-up was 18.1 mo (13.0-21.0) when the data were analyzed. There were 20 HIV infections (incidence rate = 0.85 per 100 person-years) in the intervention group and 49 (2.1 per 100 person-years) in the control group, corresponding to an RR of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.24%-0.68%; p 0.001). This RR corresponds to a protection of 60% (95% CI: 32%-76%). When controlling for behavioural factors, including sexual behaviour that increased slightly in the intervention group, condom use, and health-seeking behaviour, the protection was of 61% (95% CI: 34%-77%). Conclusion: Male circumcision provides a degree of protection against acquiring HIV infection, equivalent to what a vaccine of high efficacy would have achieved. Male circumcision may provide an important way of reducing the spread of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa.

12,2019,17194197,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"Background: Consistent with observational studies, a randomized controlled intervention trial of adult male circumcision (MC) conducted in the general population in Orange Farm (OF) (Gauteng Province, South Africa) demonstrated a protective effect against HIV acquisition of 60%. The objective of this study is to present the first cost-effectiveness analysis of the use of MC as an intervention to reduce the spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods and findings: Cost-effectiveness was modeled for 1,000 MCs done within a general adult male population. Intervention costs included performing MC and treatment of adverse events. HIV prevalence was estimated from published estimates and incidence among susceptible subjects calculated assuming a steady-state epidemic. Effectiveness was defined as the number of HIV infections averted (HIA), which was estimated by dynamically projecting over 20 years the reduction in HIV incidence observed in the OF trial, including secondary transmission to women. Net savings were calculated with adjustment for the averted lifetime duration cost of HIV treatment. Sensitivity analyses examined the effects of input uncertainty and program coverage. All results were discounted to the present at 3% per year. For Gauteng Province, assuming full coverage of the MC intervention, with a 2005 adult male prevalence of 25.6%, 1,000 circumcisions would avert an estimated 308 (80% CI 189-428) infections over 20 years. The cost is 181 dollars (80% CI 117-306 dollars) per HIA, and net savings are 2.4 million dollars (80% CI 1.3 million to 3.6 million dollars). Cost-effectiveness is sensitive to the costs of MC and of averted HIV treatment, the protective effect of MC, and HIV prevalence. With an HIV prevalence of 8.4%, the cost per HIA is 551 dollars (80% CI 344-1,071 dollars) and net savings are 753,000 (80% CI 0.3 million to 1.2 million dollars). Cost-effectiveness improves by less than 10% when MC intervention coverage is 50% of full coverage. Conclusions: In settings in sub-Saharan Africa with high or moderate HIV prevalence among the general population, adult MC is likely to be a cost-effective HIV prevention strategy, even when it has a low coverage. MC generates large net savings after adjustment for averted HIV medical costs.",0.34190887212753296
12,2019,11089626,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"Background: Male circumcision is associated with reduced HIV acquisition. Methods: HIV acquisition was determined in a cohort of 5507 HIV-negative Ugandan men, and in 187 HIV-negative men in discordant relationships. Transmission was determined in 223 HIV-positive men with HIV-negative partners. HIV incidence per 100 person years (py) and adjusted rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by Poisson regression. HIV-1 serum viral load was determined for the seropositive partners in HIV-discordant couples. Results: The prevalence of circumcision was 16.5% for all men; 99.1% in Muslims and 3.7% in non-Muslims. Circumcision was significantly associated with reduced HIV acquisition in the cohort as a whole (RR 0.53, CI 0.33-0.87), but not among non-Muslim men. Prepubertal circumcision significantly reduced HIV acquisition (RR 0.49, CI 0.26-0.82), but postpubertal circumcision did not. In discordant couples with HIV-negative men, no serconversions occurred in 50 circumcised men, whereas HIV acquisition was 16.7 per 100 py in uncircumcised men (P = 0.004). In couples with HIV-positive men, HIV transmission was significantly reduced in circumcised men with HIV viral loads less than 50000 copies/ml (P = 0.02). Interpretation: Prepubertal circumcision may reduce male HIV acquisition in a general population, but the protective effects are confounded by cultural and behavioral factors in Muslims. In discordant couples, circumcision reduces HIV acquisition and transmission. The assessment of circumcision for HIV prevention is complex and requires randomized trials.",0.26951485872268677

In this article, we review recent data on the association of male circumcision and HIV/sexually transmitted infection in men and women. This includes a summary of data showing some evidence of an effect of male circumcision against genital ulcer disease, HSV-2 infection, human papillomavirus and Trichomonas vaginalis, but not Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoea in men. Longitudinal studies among HIV discordant couples suggest that male circumcision may provide some direct long-term benefit to women, which may start after complete wound healing. Circumcision may also protect against HIV acquisition in men who have sex with men (MSM) and those who practice unprotected anal intercourse (either exclusively or predominantly), although these data are not consistent. To date, there is little evidence from the few studies available of either unsafe practices or reported increases in risky behaviour, or adverse changes in sexual satisfaction and function.

Design: A meta-analysis of observational studies. Methods: A systematic literature review was carried out of studies published up to April 1999 that included circumcision as a risk factor for HIV-1 infection among men in sub-Saharan Africa. A random effects meta-analysis was used to calculate a pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for all studies combined, and stratified by type of study population. Further analyses were conducted among those studies that adjusted for potential confounding factors. Results: Twenty-seven studies were included. Of these, 21 showed a reduced risk of HIV among circumcised men, being approximately half that in uncircumcised men (crude RR = 0.52, CI 0.40-0.68). In 15 studies that adjusted for potential confounding factors, the association was even stronger (adjusted RR = 0.42, CI 0.34-0.54). The association was stronger among men at high risk of HIV (crude RR = 0.27; adjusted RR = 0.29, CI 0.20-0.41) than among men in general populations (crude RR = 0.93; adjusted RR = 0.56, CI 0.44-0.70). Conclusion: Male circumcision is associated with a significantly reduced risk of HIV infection among men in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly those at high risk of HIV. These results suggest that consideration should be given to the acceptability and feasibility of providing safe services for male circumcision as an additional HIV prevention strategy in areas of Africa where men are not traditionally circumcised.",0.41652876138687134
12,2019,16822094,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"Background: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) has shown that male circumcision (MC) reduces sexual transmission of HIV from women to men by 60% (32%-76%; 95% CI) offering an intervention of proven efficacy for reducing the sexual spread of HIV. We explore the implications of this finding for the promotion of MC as a public health intervention to control HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods and findings: Using dynamical simulation models we consider the impact of MC on the relative prevalence of HIV in men and women and in circumcised and uncircumcised men. Using country level data on HIV prevalence and MC, we estimate the impact of increasing MC coverage on HIV incidence, HIV prevalence, and HIV-related deaths over the next ten, twenty, and thirty years in sub-Saharan Africa. Assuming that full coverage of MC is achieved over the next ten years, we consider three scenarios in which the reduction in transmission is given by the best estimate and the upper and lower 95% confidence limits of the reduction in transmission observed in the RCT. MC could avert 2.0 (1.1-3.8) million new HIV infections and 0.3 (0.1-0.5) million deaths over the next ten years in sub-Saharan Africa. In the ten years after that, it could avert a further 3.7 (1.9-7.5) million new HIV infections and 2.7 (1.5-5.3) million deaths, with about one quarter of all the incident cases prevented and the deaths averted occurring in South Africa. We show that a) MC will increase the proportion of infected people who are women from about 52% to 58%; b) where there is homogenous mixing but not all men are circumcised, the prevalence of infection in circumcised men is likely to be about 80% of that in uncircumcised men; c) MC is equivalent to an intervention, such as a vaccine or increased condom use, that reduces transmission in both directions by 37%. Conclusions: This analysis is based on the result of just one RCT, but if the results of that trial are confirmed we suggest that MC could substantially reduce the burden of HIV in Africa, especially in southern Africa where the prevalence of MC is low and the prevalence of HIV is high. While the protective benefit to HIV-negative men will be immediate, the full impact of MC on HIV-related illness and death will only be apparent in ten to twenty years.",0.2046036422252655
12,2019,34551593,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"Purpose: Randomized trials from Africa demonstrate that circumcision reduces the risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among males. However, few studies have examined this association in Western populations. We sought to evaluate the association between circumcision and the risk of acquiring HIV among males from Ontario, Canada. Materials and methods: We conducted a population-based matched cohort study of residents in Ontario, Canada. We identified males born in Ontario who underwent circumcision at any age between 1991 and 2017. The comparison group consisted of age-matched males who did not undergo circumcision. The primary outcome was incident HIV. We used cause-specific hazard models to evaluate the hazard of incident HIV. We performed several sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our results: matching on institution of birth, varying the minimum followup period, and simulating various false-negative and false-positive thresholds. Results: We studied 569,950 males, including 203,588 who underwent circumcision and 366,362 who did not. The vast majority of circumcisions (83%) were performed prior to age 1 year. In the primary analysis, we found no significant difference in the risk of HIV between groups (adjusted hazard ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.35). In none of the sensitivity analyses did we find an association between circumcision and risk of HIV. Conclusions: We found that circumcision was not independently associated with the risk of acquiring HIV among males from Ontario, Canada. Our results are consistent with clinical guidelines that emphasize safe-sex practices and counseling over circumcision as an intervention to reduce the risk of HIV.",0.05388697236776352

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception to 15 November and updated on 12 May 2020. Eligibility criteria for study selection: Randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy or safety, or both of any antidepressant drug with placebo (active or inert) in participants with low back or neck pain, sciatica, or hip or knee osteoarthritis. Data extraction and synthesis: Two independent reviewers extracted data. Pain and disability were primary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). A random effects model was used to calculate weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. Safety (any adverse event, serious adverse events, and proportion of participants who withdrew from trials owing to adverse events) was a secondary outcome. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) framework. Results: 33 trials (5318 participants) were included. Moderate certainty evidence showed that serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) reduced back pain (mean difference -5.30, 95% confidence interval -7.31 to -3.30) at 3-13 weeks and low certainty evidence that SNRIs reduced osteoarthritis pain (-9.72, -12.75 to -6.69) at 3-13 weeks. Very low certainty evidence showed that SNRIs reduced sciatica at two weeks or less (-18.60, -31.87 to -5.33) but not at 3-13 weeks (-17.50, -42.90 to 7.89). Low to very low certainty evidence showed that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) did not reduce sciatica at two weeks or less (-7.55, -18.25 to 3.15) but did at 3-13 weeks (-15.95, -31.52 to -0.39) and 3-12 months (-27.0, -36.11 to -17.89). Moderate certainty evidence showed that SNRIs reduced disability from back pain at 3-13 weeks (-3.55, -5.22 to -1.88) and disability due to osteoarthritis at two weeks or less (-5.10, -7.31 to -2.89), with low certainty evidence at 3-13 weeks (-6.07, -8.13 to -4.02). TCAs and other antidepressants did not reduce pain or disability from back pain. Conclusion: Moderate certainty evidence shows that the effect of SNRIs on pain and disability scores is small and not clinically important for back pain, but a clinically important effect cannot be excluded for osteoarthritis. TCAs and SNRIs might be effective for sciatica, but the certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42020158521.",0.2132541388273239

However, their use is controversial. Objectives: The aim of this review was to determine whether antidepressants are more effective than placebo for the treatment of non-specific low-back pain. Search strategy: Randomised controlled trials were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE (to September 2007), PsycINFO to June 2006, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 2006, issue 2, and previous systematic reviews. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials that compared antidepressant medication and placebo for patients with non-specific low-back pain, and used at least one clinically relevant outcome measure. Data collection and analysis: Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the trials. Meta-analyses were used to examine the effect of antidepressants on pain, depression and function, and the effect of antidepressant type on pain. To account for studies that could not be pooled, additional qualitative analyses were performed using the levels of evidence recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. Main results: Ten trials that compared antidepressants with placebo were included in this review. The pooled analyses showed no difference in pain relief (six trials; standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to 0.16)) or depression (two trials; SMD 0.06 (95% CI -0.29 to 0.40)) between antidepressant and placebo treatments. The qualitative analyses found conflicting evidence on the effect of antidepressants on pain intensity in chronic low-back pain, and no clear evidence that antidepressants reduce depression in chronic low-back pain patients. Two pooled analyses showed no difference in pain relief between different types of antidepressants and placebo. Our findings were not altered by the sensitivity analyses which varied the level of methodological quality required for inclusion in the meta-analyses to allow data from additional trials to be examined. Two additional trials were identified in September 2007 and await assessment. Authors' conclusions: There is no clear evidence that antidepressants are more effective than placebo in the management of patients with chronic low-back pain. These findings do not imply that severely depressed patients with back pain should not be treated with antidepressants; furthermore, there is evidence for their use in other forms of chronic pain.",0.09714542329311371

Of these 74 completed the trial; of the 29 who did not complete, 19 were withdrawn because of adverse effects. The intervention consisted of an 8-week course of maprotiline (up to 150 mg daily) or paroxetine (up to 30 mg daily) or an active placebo, diphenhydramine hydrochloride (up to 37.5 mg daily). Patients were excluded for current major depression. Reduction in pain intensity (Descriptor Differential Scale scores) was significantly greater for study completers randomized to maprotiline compared to placebo (P=0.023), and to paroxetine (P=0.013), with a reduction of pain by 45% compared to 27% on placebo and 26% on paroxetine.

Objectives: To systematically review the efficacy of antidepressants for the treatment of patients with back pain and to determine whether there is evidence that outcomes vary between classes of antidepressants. Materials and methods: Best evidence synthesis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral antidepressive agents in patients with back pain. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry. Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and assessed included studies with a 22-point methodologic quality assessment scale. Effect sizes were calculated if sufficient data were available. Results: Twenty-two trials of antidepressants for the treatment of back pain were identified, of which seven studies of chronic low back pain met inclusion criteria. Among studies using antidepressants that inhibit norepinephrine reuptake (tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants), four of five found significant improvement in at least one relevant outcome measure. Assessment of these agents' impact on functional measures produced mixed results. No benefit in pain relief or functional status was found in three studies of antidepressants that do not inhibit norepinephrine reuptake. Conclusions: Based on a small number of studies, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants appear to produce moderate symptom reductions for patients with chronic low back pain. This benefit appears to be independent of depression status. SSRIs do not appear to be beneficial for patients with chronic low back pain. There is conflicting evidence whether antidepressants improve functional status of patients with chronic low back pain.",0.23027896881103516

The efficacy, acceptability, and safety of antidepressant medicines for low back pain (LBP) are not clear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of antidepressant medicines for LBP. Methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov , the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform from inception to May 2020. We included published and trial registry reports of RCTs that allocated adult participants with LBP to receive an antidepressant medicine or a placebo medicine. Pairs of authors independently extracted data in duplicate. We extracted participant characteristics, study sample size, outcome values, and measures of variance for each outcome. We data using random-effects meta-analysis models and calculated estimates of effects and heterogeneity for each outcome. We formed judgments of confidence in the evidence in accordance with GRADE. We report our findings in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We prespecified all outcomes in a prospectively registered protocol. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and acceptability. We measured pain intensity at end-of-treatment on a 0-100 point scale and considered 10 points the minimal clinically important difference. We defined acceptability as the odds of stopping treatment for any reason. Results: We included 23 RCTs in this review. Data were available for pain in 17 trials and acceptability in 14 trials. Treatment with antidepressants decreased pain intensity by 4.33 points (95% CI - 6.15 to - 2.50) on a 0-100 scale, compared to placebo. Treatment with antidepressants increased the odds of stopping treatment for any reason (OR 1.27 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.56]), compared to placebo. Conclusions: Treatment of LBP with antidepressants is associated with small reductions in pain intensity and increased odds of stopping treatment for any reason, compared to placebo. The effect on pain is not clinically important. The effect on acceptability warrants consideration. These findings provide Level I evidence to guide clinicians in their use of antidepressants to treat LBP.

During this treatment several hypotheses regarding the modes of action of these drugs were examined. A low serotonin hypothesis was supported by the fact that patients who had pain relief following an acute challenge with fenfluramine, a relatively pure releaser of serotonin, were significantly more likely to have pain relief on either antidepressant. The antidepressants did not change cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-endorphin levels, acute pain tolerance, or electromyogram (EMG) levels. The nonsedating antidepressant desipramine was as effective as doxepin; 60% of patients had significant pain relief. Pain relief was associated with depression relief, but several patients had only pain or depression relief.

Methods: In this narrative review, the results of 13 RCTs and 5 systematic reviews examining the analgesic effect of various antidepressants in CLBP were contrasted with those of 3 placebo-controlled duloxetine RCTs. Treatment effects based on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) average score in the duloxetine RCTs were assessed in all completers (by study and overall) and in last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) analyses (extracted from study reports). 30%- and 50%-reduction response rates were compared between duloxetine and placebo. Results: Eleven different antidepressants were examined in 13 individual RCTs. Sample sizes, treatment durations, and analysis methods varied across studies. Reviews each included 5 to 9 of the RCTs and came to different conclusions regarding the analgesic effect of antidepressants: 2 found no evidence while 3 reported some evidence. The completer analysis showed greater improvements in BPI average scores with duloxetine vs. placebo (significant in 2 studies). Overall, the least square mean (standard error) difference between treatments was - 0.7 (0.15) (P 0.0001). Overall response rates were significantly larger with duloxetine than with placebo. Conclusions: Due to the diversity of previous studies and the pooling methods used, the conclusions regarding the analgesic effect of antidepressants in CLBP drawn from systematic reviews must be interpreted with caution. Appropriately designed and powered studies similar to recently published duloxetine studies are recommended to demonstrate the analgesic effect of antidepressants.",0.31970229744911194

The purpose of this study was to describe pain and mood response to venlafaxine among older adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP) and depression relative to opioid exposure. Design: Secondary analyses were collected from a randomized clinical trial testing a stepped-care approach to comorbid pain and depression in older patients: the Addressing Depression and Pain Together study (ADAPT: 2010-2016). Setting: University-based late-life mental health research clinic. Subjects: Two hundred twenty-seven adults aged 65+ years with CLBP and depression. Methods: Participants received six weeks of lower-dose venlafaxine (≤150 mg/d). Pain and depression were measured each week. Response for both pain and depression at the end of six weeks was defined by a ≥30% improvement on a 0-20 numeric rating scale for low back pain and a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≤5. Opioid exposure was analyzed as prescribed (yes or no) and by morphine equivalent dosing (MED). Results: Patients co-prescribed an opioid were less likely to report a pain response to venlafaxine. MED was negatively correlated with pain response. Depression response was not impacted. Conclusions: Opioids are negatively associated with older adults' early analgesic response to lower-dose venlafaxine. These findings suggest that clinicians may wish to consider either nonopioid or alternative antidepressant approaches to pain management in these complex patients. It is reassuring that opioids do not prevent depression response. Future research should examine both longer duration of treatment and a wider range of doses.,0.35815462470054626
13,2019,30285054,Find documents that discuss using antidepressants for helping to manage or relieve lower back pain.,antidepressants low-back pain,0.0,"Importance: Antidepressants at low dose are commonly prescribed for the management of chronic low back pain and their use is recommended in international clinical guidelines. However, there is no evidence for their efficacy. Objective: To examine the efficacy of a low-dose antidepressant compared with an active comparator in reducing pain, disability, and work absence and hindrance in individuals with chronic low back pain. Design, setting, and participants: A double-blind, randomized clinical trial with a 6-month follow-up of adults with chronic, nonspecific, low back pain who were recruited through hospital/medical clinics and advertising was carried out. Intervention: Low-dose amitriptyline (25 mg/d) or an active comparator (benztropine mesylate, 1 mg/d) for 6 months. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was pain intensity measured at 3 and 6 months using the visual analog scale and Descriptor Differential Scale. Secondary outcomes included disability assessed using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire and work absence and hindrance assessed using the Short Form Health and Labour Questionnaire. Results: Of the 146 randomized participants (90 [61.6%] male; mean [SD] age, 54.8 [13.7] years), 118 (81%) completed 6-month follow-up. Treatment with low-dose amitriptyline did not result in greater pain reduction than the comparator at 6 (adjusted difference, -7.81; 95% CI, -15.7 to 0.10) or 3 months (adjusted difference, -1.05; 95% CI, -7.87 to 5.78), independent of baseline pain. There was no statistically significant difference in disability between the groups at 6 months (adjusted difference, -0.98; 95% CI, -2.42 to 0.46); however, there was a statistically significant improvement in disability for the low-dose amitriptyline group at 3 months (adjusted difference, -1.62; 95% CI, -2.88 to -0.36). There were no differences between the groups in work outcomes at 6 months (adjusted difference, absence: 1.51; 95% CI, 0.43-5.38; hindrance: 0.53; 95% CI, 0.19-1.51), or 3 months (adjusted difference, absence: 0.86; 95% CI, 0.32-2.31; hindrance: 0.78; 95% CI, 0.29-2.08), or in the number of participants who withdrew owing to adverse events (9 [12%] in each group; χ2 = 0.004; P = .95). Conclusions and relevance: This trial suggests that amitriptyline may be an effective treatment for chronic low back pain. There were no significant improvements in outcomes at 6 months, but there was a reduction in disability at 3 months, an improvement in pain intensity that was nonsignificant at 6 months, and minimal adverse events reported with a low-dose, modest sample size and active comparator. Although large-scale clinical trials that include dose escalation are needed, it may be worth considering low-dose amitriptyline if the only alternative is an opioid.

New evidence on the effects and safety of paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and antidepressants for LBP warrants an updated overview for musculoskeletal clinicians on this topic. Clinical question: How effective and safe are paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and antidepressants compared with placebo for treating LBP? Key results: For acute LBP ( 12 weeks), muscle relaxants and NSAIDs may be superior to placebo for reducing pain, but the effects of opioids, antibiotics, and antidepressants are unknown. Paracetamol provides no additional benefit for acute LBP. For chronic LBP (&gt;12 weeks), NSAIDs, antidepressants, and opioids may be superior to placebo for reducing pain, but opioids have an established profile of harms. Antibiotics may also reduce pain for people with chronic LBP with Modic type 1 changes, although the risks may outweigh their benefits. The effects of paracetamol and muscle relaxants for chronic LBP were unclear. Clinical application: NSAIDs may have a role in managing acute and chronic LBP, with cautious use in people who may be at greater risk of experiencing adverse events. Paracetamol, opioid analgesics, antibiotics, muscle relaxants, and antidepressants should only be prescribed following a discussion between the treating clinician and the patient, considering the risks and possible benefits, and after or in conjunction with recommended nonpharmacological strategies for improving LBP.

16,2019,32956536,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"Background: Skeletal muscle cramps are common and often occur in association with pregnancy, advanced age, exercise or motor neuron disorders (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Typically, such cramps have no obvious underlying pathology, and so are termed idiopathic. Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps but the efficacy of magnesium for this purpose remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012, and performed to identify and incorporate more recent studies. Objectives: To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation compared to no treatment, placebo control or other cramp therapies in people with skeletal muscle cramps. SEARCH METHODS: On 9 September 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and SPORTDiscus. We also searched WHO-ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov for registered trials that might be ongoing or unpublished, and ISI Web of Science for studies citing the studies included in this review. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of magnesium supplementation (in any form) to prevent skeletal muscle cramps in any patient group (i.e. all clinical presentations of cramp). We considered comparisons of magnesium with no treatment, placebo control, or other therapy. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Two review authors assessed risk of bias. We attempted to contact all study authors when questions arose and obtained participant-level data for four of the included trials, one of which was unpublished. We collected all data on adverse effects from the included RCTs. Main results: We identified 11 trials (nine parallel-group, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 735 individuals, amongst whom 118 cross-over participants additionally served as their own controls. Five trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps (408 participants) and five trials enrolled people with idiopathic cramps (271 participants, with 118 additionally crossed over to control). Another study enrolled 29 people with liver cirrhosis, only some of whom suffered muscle cramps. All trials provided magnesium as an oral supplement, except for one trial which provided magnesium as a series of slow intravenous infusions. Nine trials compared magnesium to placebo, one trial compared magnesium to no treatment, calcium carbonate or vitamin B, and another trial compared magnesium to vitamin E or calcium. We judged the single trial in people with liver cirrhosis and all five trials in participants with pregnancy-associated leg cramps to be at high risk of bias. In contrast, we rated the risk of bias high in only one of five trials in participants with idiopathic rest cramps. For idiopathic cramps, largely in older adults (mean age 61.6 to 69.3 years) presumed to have nocturnal leg cramps (the commonest presentation), differences in measures of cramp frequency when comparing magnesium to placebo were small, not statistically significant, and showed minimal heterogeneity (I² = 0% to 12%). This includes the primary endpoint, percentage change from baseline in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (mean difference (MD) -9.59%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -23.14% to 3.97%; 3 studies, 177 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the difference in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (MD -0.18 cramps/week, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.49; 5 studies, 307 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 3 studies, 177 participants; high-certainty evidence). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found at four weeks in measures of cramp intensity or cramp duration. This includes the number of participants rating their cramps as moderate or severe at four weeks (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.21; 2 studies, 91 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the percentage of participants with the majority of cramp durations of one minute or more at four weeks (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.53, 1 study, 46 participants; low-certainty evidence). We were unable to perform meta-analysis for trials of pregnancy-associated leg cramps. The single study comparing magnesium to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a three-point ordinal scale of overall treatment efficacy. Of the three trials comparing magnesium to placebo, one found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures, another found benefit for both, and a third reported inconsistent results for frequency that could not be reconciled. The single study in people with liver cirrhosis was small and had limited reporting of cramps, but found no difference in terms of cramp frequency or cramp intensity. Our analysis of adverse events pooled all studies, regardless of the setting in which cramps occurred. Major adverse events (occurring in 2 out of 72 magnesium recipients and 3 out of 68 placebo recipients), and withdrawals due to adverse events, were not significantly different from placebo. However, in the four studies for which it could be determined, more participants experienced minor adverse events in the magnesium group than in the placebo group (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.33; 4 studies, 254 participants; low-certainty evidence). Overall, oral magnesium was associated with mostly gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g. diarrhoea), experienced by 11% (10% in control) to 37% (14% in control) of participants. Authors' conclusions: It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this population is needed. We found no RCTs evaluating magnesium for exercise-associated muscle cramps or disease-state-associated muscle cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease) other than a single small (inconclusive) study in people with liver cirrhosis, only some of whom suffered cramps.",0.20854239165782928

The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different, being 8% lower in the magnesium group (95% CI -28% to 12%, moderate quality evidence). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found at four weeks in measures of cramp intensity (moderate quality evidence) or cramp duration (low quality evidence).Meta-analysis was not possible for trials of pregnancy-associated leg cramps. The single study comparing magnesium to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a three-point ordinal scale of overall treatment efficacy. The two trials comparing magnesium to placebo differed in that one trial found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures while the other found benefit for both.Withdrawals due to adverse events were not significantly different than placebo. While we could not determine the number of subjects with minor adverse events, studies of oral magnesium generally described potential side effects as similar in frequency to placebo. Authors' conclusions: It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this patient population is needed. We found no randomized controlled trials evaluating magnesium for exercise-associated muscle cramps or disease state-associated muscle cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease).",0.23141276836395264
16,2019,33149925,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"Purpose of review: Strategies to mitigate muscle cramps are a top research priority for patients receiving hemodialysis. As hypomagnesemia is a possible risk factor for cramping, we reviewed the literature to better understand the physiology of cramping as well as the epidemiology of hypomagnesemia and muscle cramps. We also sought to review the evidence from interventional studies on the effect of oral and dialysate magnesium-based therapies on muscle cramps. Sources of information: Peer-reviewed articles. Methods: We searched for relevant articles in major bibliographic databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE. The methodological quality of interventional studies was assessed using a modified version of the Downs and Blacks criteria checklist. Key findings: The etiology of muscle cramps in patients receiving hemodialysis is poorly understood and there are no clear evidence-based prevention or treatment strategies. Several factors may play a role including a low concentration of serum magnesium. The prevalence of hypomagnesemia (concentration of 0.7 mmol/L) in patients receiving hemodialysis ranges from 10% to 20%. Causes of hypomagnesemia include a low dietary intake of magnesium, use of medications that inhibit magnesium absorption (eg, proton pump inhibitors), increased magnesium excretion (eg, high-dose loop diuretics), and a low concentration of dialysate magnesium. Dialysate magnesium concentrations of ≤0.5 mmol/L may be associated with a decrease in serum magnesium concentration over time. Preliminary evidence from observational and interventional studies suggests a higher dialysate magnesium concentration will raise serum magnesium concentrations and may reduce the frequency and severity of muscle cramps. However, the quality of evidence supporting this benefit is limited, and larger, multicenter clinical trials are needed to further determine if magnesium-based therapy can reduce muscle cramps in patients receiving hemodialysis. In studies conducted to date, increasing the concentration of dialysate magnesium appears to be well-tolerated and is associated with a low risk of symptomatic hypermagnesemia. Limitations: Few interventional studies have examined the effect of magnesium-based therapy on muscle cramps in patients receiving hemodialysis and most were nonrandomized, pre-post study designs.",0.3343214690685272
16,2019,22909270,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"Leg cramps are common in pregnant women. Currently, there is no standard treatment for pregnancy-induced leg cramps. The objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of oral magnesium in pregnant women with leg cramps. This double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial included 86 healthy pregnant women, 14-34 weeks of gestation who had leg cramps at least twice per week. The study period was 4 weeks. Eighty women completed the study. Forty-one women were assigned to magnesium bisglycinate chelate (300 mg per day) and 39 women to placebo. Details of leg cramps were recorded before beginning the treatment and the fourth week of study. Outcome measure was the reduction of cramp frequency after treatment and cramp intensity measured by 100-mm visual analogue scale. Fifty per cent reduction of cramp frequency was significantly higher in the magnesium group than the placebo group (86.0% vs. 60.5%, P=0.007). The 50% reduction of cramp intensity was also significantly higher in the treatment group than in the placebo group (69.8% vs. 48.8%, P=0.048). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of side effects such as nausea and diarrhoea. These results demonstrated that oral magnesium supplement can improve the frequency and intensity of pregnancy-induced leg cramps. Therefore, oral magnesium may be a treatment option for women suffering from pregnancy-induced leg cramps.",0.27588221430778503
16,2019,12011773,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"Background: Nocturnal leg cramps are common and distressing. The only treatment of proven effectiveness is quinine, but this has a number of side effects. Magnesium salts have been shown to reduce leg cramp distress in pregnancy. This study tests whether magnesium citrate is effective in the treatment of leg cramps in non-pregnant individuals by conducting in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over placebo-controlled trial. Material/methods: Volunteers suffering regular leg cramps were recruited. Magnesium citrate equivalent to 300 mg magnesium and matching placebo were given for 6 weeks each. The number of cramps recorded in the cramp diary during the final 4 weeks of magnesium and placebo treatment, severity and duration of cramps and the participants' subjective assessment of effectiveness were analysed. Results: In subjects who started with placebo (n=29) the median (95% CI) number of cramps was 9 (6-17) on placebo and 5 (4-8) on magnesium. For the group starting with magnesium (n=17) the median no of cramps was 9 (5-13) on magnesium and 8 (4-14) on placebo. There was no significant carry-over effect (p=0.88), but a highly significant period effect (p=0.008). There was a trend towards less cramps on magnesium (p=0.07). There was no difference in cramp severity and duration between the groups. Significantly more subjects thought that the treatment had helped after magnesium than after placebo 36 (78%) and 25 (54%) respectively, (p=0.03). Diarrhoea was recorded as a side effect of magnesium. Conclusions: The results suggest that magnesium may be effective in treatment of nocturnal leg cramps.

Design: Case report. Setting: Pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care, university-based children's hospital. Interventions: A continuous infusion of magnesium sulfate. Measurements and main results: We describe a 12-yr-old child with moderate to severe tetanus who was treated with a continuous infusion of magnesium sulfate to control painful muscle spasms and severe generalized rigidity initially refractory to moderate sedation. Muscle spasms and severe generalized rigidity were improved with magnesium sulfate. No adverse effects associated with the use of magnesium sulfate were noted during the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory function, reflexes, and serum magnesium concentrations. Conclusions: An infusion of magnesium sulfate can be utilized to treat muscle spasms and severe generalized rigidity without the need for deep sedation, mechanical ventilation, or neuromuscular blockade. We recommend that magnesium sulfate be considered in the armamentarium of therapeutics utilized to treat muscle spasms and rigidity associated with tetanus, provided the patient's neurologic, cardiovascular, and respiratory status can be closely monitored in the pediatric intensive care unit.",0.15305018424987793

One review author extracted data on the study population, interventions, and final results. The methodological quality and the clinical relevance were independently assessed by two review authors. Because it was not possible to perform a quantitative analysis, we performed a qualitative analysis in which the strength of evidence on the effectiveness of lumbar supports was classified as strong, moderate, limited, conflicting, or no evidence. Main results: Seven preventive studies (14,437 people) and eight treatment studies (1361 people) were included in this updated review. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was rather low. Only five of the fifteen studies met 50% or more of the internal validity items.

Objective: To assess the efficacy of lumbar supports and education in the prevention of low back pain in industry. Design: A randomized controlled trial with a factorial design. Setting: The cargo department of an airline company in the Netherlands. Participants: A total of 312 workers were randomized, of whom 282 were available for the 6-month follow-up. Interventions: Subjects were randomly assigned to 4 groups: (1) education (lifting instructions) and lumbar support, (2) education, (3) lumbar support, and (4) no intervention. Education consisted of 3 group sessions on lifting techniques with a total duration of 5 hours. Lumbar supports were recommended to be used during working hours for 6 months. Main outcome measures: Low back pain incidence and sick leave because of back pain during the 6-month intervention period. Results: Compliance with wearing the lumbar support at least half the time was 43%.

Objective: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of NRLSs in the treatment and prevention of non-specific low back pain. Methods: We searched for reports of randomized controlled trials in PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Science Direct and Pedro databases. Data were analyzed by disease stage (acute, subacute, and chronic) and type of prevention (primary and secondary). The analysis of methodological quality involved the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. Results: Of the 1581 records retrieved, only 4 full-text articles were included, with 777 patients: 378 in the NRLS group, and 348 in the control group. NRLSs conferred greater amelioration of disability (effect size -0.54, 95% CI -0.90; -0.17) and pain (-0.29, -0.46; -0.12) than standard management. Insufficient data prevented a comparison of the efficiency for acute, subacute and recurrent low back pain as well as meta-regression of responder phenotypes (sociodemographic and other patient characteristics).

Secondary analyses from primary preventive studies suggest benefit among workers with previous low back pain, but definitive studies on the effectiveness of supports for the secondary prevention of low back pain are lacking. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of lumbar supports in the secondary prevention of low back pain. Design: Randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Home care organization in the Netherlands. Patients: 360 home care workers with self-reported history of low back pain. Intervention: Short course on healthy working methods, with or without patient-directed use of 1 of 4 types of lumbar support. Measurements: Primary outcomes were the number of days of low back pain and sick leave over 12 months. Secondary outcomes were the average severity of low back pain and function (Quebec Back Pain Disability scale) in the previous week. Results: Over 12 months, participants in the lumbar support group reported an average of -52.7 days (CI, -59.6 to -45.1 days) fewer days with low back pain than participants who received only the short course. However, the total sick days in the lumbar support group did not decrease (-5 days [CI, -21.1 to 6.8 days]). Small but statistically significant differences in pain intensity and function favored lumbar support. Limitations: Study participants were unblinded, and a substantial amount of missing data required imputation. Objective data on sick days due to low back pain were not available.

Only home care workers who had LBP at the start of the study or who had experienced at least two episodes of LBP in the 12 months prior to the study could apply for participation. The study consisted of two phases. In phase I (the first week of the study), workers used the lumbar support each working day. In phase II (the following 6 months), subjects were instructed to use the lumbar support only on those working days when they experienced LBP. Weekly questionnaires were used to measure compliance; monthly questionnaires were used to measure the benefit experienced. Fifty-nine workers participated in the study. Overall, they scored their perceived benefit from the lumbar support as 7 on a scale of 0-10, and 61-81% of the workers were compliant. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the best predictor for experienced benefit is the degree of confidence in expected pain reduction due to the lumbar support, measured after phase I (R(2) = 0.70). Multiple logistic analysis showed that the best predictor for compliance is the extent to which subjects consider they can influence their own health status (R(2) = 0.49). Because both the benefit experienced and the compliance rate were substantial, the use of lumbar supports by home care workers with LBP seems feasible.

Objective: To determine the cost-effectiveness of wearing a lumbar support for home care workers with recurrent low back pain (LBP) (secondary prevention). Summary of background data: LBP is a large medical and economical burden. Evidence on the secondary preventive use of lumbar supports is sparse. Methods: A total of 360 home care workers with a self-reported history of LBP were randomly assigned to usual care or usual care plus wearing a lumbar support on working days with LBP, during a 1-year period. Primary clinical outcome measures were the average number of self-reported days with LBP, number of calendar days sick leave in general, and quality of life. Direct and indirect costs were measured by means of cost diaries. Differences in mean costs between groups, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility ratios were evaluated, and cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves presented by applying nonparametric bootstrapping techniques. Results: During the intervention period, the home care workers using a lumbar support in addition to usual care reported on average 54 fewer days with LBP (95% confidence interval [CI], -85 to -29). The estimated mean difference in sick leave was not statistically significant (-5.0 days per year in favor of the lumbar support group; 95% CI, -21.1 to 6.8). There was no statistically significant difference in quality of life. Direct costs were 235 euros (US$ 266) lower in the lumbar support group (95% CI, -386 to -79). Indirect costs were 255 euros (US$ 288) lower, but this was not statistically significant (95% CI, -879 to 299). Conclusion: Lumbar support seems to be a cost-effective addition to usual care for home care workers with recurrent LBP. For estimating the LBP-related indirect costs, it would be more precise when an objective measure for LBP-related sick leave would have been available.

A sitting device that reduces spinal load and low back muscle activities may help increase sitting comfort and reduce LBP risk. The objective of this study is to investigate the biomechanical effect of sitting with a reduced ischial support and an enhanced lumbar support (Off-Loading) on load, interface pressure and muscle activities. Methods: A laboratory test in low back pain (LBP) and asymptomatic subjects was designed to test the biomechanical effect of using the Off-Loading sitting posture. The load and interface pressure on seat and the backrest, and back muscle activities associated with usual and this Off-Loading posture were recorded and compared between the two postures. Results: Compared with Normal (sitting upright with full support of the seat and flat backrest) posture, sitting in Off-Loading posture significantly shifted the center of the force and the peak pressure on the seat anteriorly towards the thighs. It also significantly decreased the contact area on the seat and increased that on the backrest. It decreased the lumbar muscle activities significantly. These effects are similar in individuals with and without LBP.

The current review focused on electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices for the treatment of urinary incontinence in men. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices for men with stress, urgency or mixed urinary incontinence in comparison with no treatment, placebo treatment, or any other 'single' treatment. Additionally, the effectiveness of electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices in combination with another intervention was compared with the other intervention alone. Finally, the effectiveness of one method of electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices was compared with another method. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 21 January 2012). We also searched other electronic and non-electronic bibliographic databases and the reference lists of the included studies as well as contacting researchers in the field to identify other relevant trials. Selection criteria: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed all the identified trials for eligibility. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for determining bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, and a third review author was involved in the case of no consensus. Data were analysed using Cochrane methods. Main results: Six randomized controlled trials (five full papers and one abstract) were included. There was considerable variation in the interventions used, study protocols, types of electrical stimulation parameters and devices, study populations and outcome measures. In total 544 men were included, of whom 305 received some form of electrical stimulation, and 239 a control or comparator treatment. The trials were mostly small and generally there was not sufficient information to assess risk of bias; only two trials used secure methods of randomization.There was some evidence that electrical stimulation (ES) had a short-term effect in reducing incontinence compared with sham treatment (for example risk ratio (RR) at six months 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.87) but not at 12 months. Four trials evaluated the effect of adding PFMT to ES versus pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) alone or with biofeedback. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the number of men with urinary incontinence at three months (146/239, 61% for combined treatment versus 98/156, 63% with PFMT alone; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.06). However, there were more adverse effects with combined treatment (23/139, 17% versus 2/99, 2% with PFMT alone; RR 7.04, 95% CI 1.51 to 32.94) and quality of life also seemed better with PFMT alone. One small trial did not detect statistically significant differences between two methods of administration of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (anal versus perineal) but the quality of life score was lower (better) in the anal stimulation group.

Patients and methods: Sixty-three men with urinary incontinence &gt;/= 8 weeks after radical prostatectomy were randomized to one of three groups; group 1, standard treatment (control); group 2, intensive pelvic muscle exercises (PME); or group 3, PME plus electrical stimulation (PME+ES). Group 1 received verbal and written instructions about postoperative PME from their urologist and from the nurses at the pre-admission clinic. Groups 2 and 3 were treated by a physiotherapist for 30 min twice a week for 12 weeks and carried out home exercises three times a day on the days when they were not treated. Outcome was assessed using the 24-h pad test, two validated quality-of-life questionnaires and a urine symptom inventory, all obtained at baseline, 12, 16 and 24 weeks after enrolment. The final pad test was carried out approximately 8 months after surgery. Results: Fifty-eight patients completed the study, 21 in group 1, 18 in group 2 and 19 in group 3; five discontinued, three with bladder neck contractures requiring dilatation, one with rectal pain when doing the exercises and one unable to complete therapy while on vacation. The mean (median) time elapsed from surgery to entry into the study was 19 (8) weeks. At 12 weeks from baseline, the mean overall urine loss had decreased from 463 g to 115 g but there were no differences among groups, nor were there significant differences in urine loss at 16 and 24 weeks (F=0. 16, P=0.69). There was a significant impact on quality of life during the early recovery. Despite preoperative instructions, many patients revealed little or no knowledge about catheter care, bladder spasms, rectal pain, incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Little of the preoperative education was retained because of the overwhelming nature of the diagnosis. Conclusions: From the initial assessment to the final pad-test at approximately 8 months after surgery, incontinence improved greatly in all three groups. This rapid improvement may have masked any treatment benefit. Further research should address incontinence in men whose urine loss has stabilized and who underwent surgery &gt;8 months previously. Moreover, a telephone-based follow-up soon after discharge may alleviate many of the concerns expressed.",0.23483505845069885

Materials and methods: A total of 56 men with severe urinary incontinence (more than 200 gm daily), mean ± SD age 66.6 ± 6.2 years, were randomized to an active treatment group (26) or a sham group (30). All patients performed pelvic floor muscle training preoperatively and continued throughout the study. For active stimulation 50 Hz square waves of 300 μs pulse duration and a 5 seconds on, 5 seconds off duty cycle were applied for 15 minutes twice daily with an anal electrode. Sham stimulation was limited to 3 mA with a 2 seconds on, 13 seconds off duty cycle. Results: In the active group 8 (36%), 14 (63%), 18 (81%) and 19 (86%) patients were continent (22) vs 1 (4%), 4 (16%), 11 (44%) and 17 (86%) in the sham group (25) (leakage less than 8 gm daily) after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. There was a significant difference in the number of continent patients between the groups at 1, 3 and 6 months (p = 0.0161, p = 0.0021 and p = 0.0156, respectively). The time to achieve continence was significantly shorter in the active group (2.71 ± 2.6 months) than in the sham group (6.82 ± 3.9 months, p = 0.0006). Changes in the amount of leakage, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form score and the King's Health Questionnaire score were significantly larger in the active group at 1 month but there was no difference at 12 months.

Methods: Sixty-eight patients (29 men, 39 women, 70.0 +/- 11.2 years) were studied. Detrusor overactivity was urodynamically defined as involuntary detrusor contractions of more than 15 cm H(2)O during the filling phase. Ten-hertz square waves of 1-ms pulse duration were used. A vaginal electrode was used in the women and an anal or surface electrode in the men. The stimulation was given for 15 minutes twice daily for 4 weeks. The efficacy was evaluated on the basis of a frequency/volume chart and urodynamic study before and after treatment. Results: Thirty-two patients in the active group and 28 in the sham group completed the study. The patient impressions were very good or good in 59% and 39% of the active and the sham group, respectively (P = 0.0354). On the cystometrogram, the bladder capacity at the first desire to void and the maximum desire to void increased significantly (P = 0.0104 and P = 0.0046, respectively) in the active group, but not in the sham group. Seven patients in the active group and 1 patient in the sham group were cured (P = 0.0324); 26 patients (81.3%) in the active group and 9 (32.1%) in the sham group improved (P = 0.0001). Of 17 patients in the active group, 13 remained cured or improved for an average of 8.4 months after completion of the 4-week treatment; in the sham group, 3 of 6 patients were cured or improved for an average of 4.7 months after completion of the 4-week treatment.

Methods: 37 patients (32 females and 5 males) with urinary incontinence were treated with peripheral electrical stimulation. The urodynamic diagnosis were: detrusor instability (24.3%), stress urinary incontinence (24.3%), mixed urinary incontinence (48.6%), and bladder hyper-reflexia (2.7%). Rectal and vaginal electrodes were utilized. The therapeutic frequencies were 10 Hz, 20 Hz and 50 Hz. Results: Detrusor instability disappeared in the cases treated with the 10 Hz frequency (79%) and in one case treated with the 50 Hz frequency. A significantly increased bladder capacity and decreased first micturition sensation were observed in this patient group. All patients with stress urinary incontinence were treated with high frequency (50 Hz), which achieved positive results in 44%. In the group of patients with mixed urinary incontinence. 45% remained unchanged. Treatment failed to achieve satisfactory results in the single case of detrusor hyperreflexia in this series. Conclusion: Peripheral electrical stimulation is a valid alternative in the treatment of male and female incontinence. Satisfactory results were achieved with the 10 Hz frequency in 89% of the patients with bladder instability and with the 50 Hz frequency in 44% of the patients with stress urinary incontinence.",0.2225722223520279

Materials and methods: We studied 44 patients with stress incontinence (six men and 38 women, age 63 +/- 13), including 9 patients in the investigational study and 35 in the double-blind study. We used 50 Hz. square waves of 1 ms. pulse duration for stimulation. A vaginal electrode was used in women and an anal electrode in men. Urethral pressure profile before, during and after 15-minute stimulation was measured in the investigational study. In the double-blind trial an active device and a dummy device were used, and efficacy was judged from patient impressions, records in frequency/volume chart, results of 1-hour pad test and urodynamic parameters after 4-week treatment. Results: In the investigational study maximum urethral closure pressure (mean plus or minus standard deviation) before, during and after stimulation was 44.4 +/- 17.5, 64.5 +/- 28.8 and 46.8 +/- 25.6 cm. water, respectively. This parameter significantly increased (p = 0.0275) during stimulation. In the double-blind trial patient impressions were good in 60% of the active device group and 8% of the dummy device group (p = 0.0051). For the pad test significant improvement was noted in the active device group (p = 0.0100). Cure rate was 45% in the active device group and 7.7% in the dummy device group.

18,2019,27935011,Can electrical stimulation devices treat male urinary incontinence?,electrical stimulation male urinary incontinence,0.0,"Background: Several options exist for managing overactive bladder (OAB), including electrical stimulation (ES) with non-implanted devices, conservative treatment and drugs. Electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices aims to inhibit contractions of the detrusor muscle, potentially reducing urinary frequency and urgency. Objectives: To assess the effects of ES with non-implanted electrodes for OAB, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, compared with: placebo or any other active treatment; ES added to another intervention compared with the other intervention alone; different methods of ES compared with each other. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 10 December 2015). We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted specialists in the field. We imposed no language restrictions. Selection criteria: We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of ES with non-implanted devices compared with any other treatment for OAB in adults. Eligible trials included adults with OAB with or without urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). Trials whose participants had stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were excluded. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data from eligible trials and assessed risk of bias, using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Main results: We identified 63 eligible trials (4424 randomised participants). Forty-four trials did not report the primary outcomes of perception of cure or improvement in OAB. The majority of trials were deemed to be at low or unclear risk of selection and attrition bias and unclear risk of performance and detection bias. Lack of clarity with regard to risk of bias was largely due to poor reporting.For perception of improvement in OAB symptoms, moderate-quality evidence indicated that ES was better than pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) (risk ratio (RR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 2.14; n = 195), drug treatment (RR 1.20, 95% 1.04 to 1.38; n = 439). and placebo or sham treatment (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.85 to 2.77, n = 677) but it was unclear if ES was more effective than placebo/sham for urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) (RR 5.03, 95% CI 0.28 to 89.88; n = 242). Drug treatments included in the trials were oestrogen cream, oxybutynin, propantheline bromide, probanthine, solifenacin succinate, terodiline, tolterodine and trospium chloride.Low- or very low-quality evidence suggested no evidence of a difference in perception of improvement of UUI when ES was compared to PFMT with or without biofeedback.Low- quality evidence indicated that OAB symptoms were more likely to improve with ES than with no active treatment (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.55; n = 121).Low- quality evidence suggested participants receiving ES plus PFMT, compared to those receiving PFMT only, were more than twice as likely to report improvement in UUI (RR 2.82, 95% CI 1.44 to 5.52; n = 51).There was inconclusive evidence, which was either low- or very low-quality, for OAB-related quality of life when ES was compared to no active treatment, placebo/sham or biofeedback-assisted PFMT, or when ES was added to PFMT compared to PFMT-only. There was very low-quality evidence from a single trial to suggest that ES may be better than PFMT in terms of OAB-related quality of life.There was a lower risk of adverse effects with ES than tolterodine (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.27; n = 200) (moderate-quality evidence) and oxybutynin (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.84; n = 79) (low-quality evidence).Due to the very low-quality evidence available, we could not be certain whether there were fewer adverse effects with ES compared to placebo/sham treatment, magnetic stimulation or solifenacin succinate. We were also very uncertain whether adding ES to PFMT or to drug therapy resulted in fewer adverse effects than PFMT or drug therapy alone Nor could we tell if there was any difference in risk of adverse effects between different types of ES.There was insufficient evidence to determine if one type of ES was more effective than another or if the benefits of ES persisted after the active treatment period stopped. Authors' conclusions: Electrical stimulation shows promise in treating OAB, compared to no active treatment, placebo/sham treatment, PFMT and drug treatment. It is possible that adding ES to other treatments such as PFMT may be beneficial. However, the low quality of the evidence base overall means that we cannot have full confidence in these conclusions until adequately powered trials have been carried out, measuring subjective outcomes and adverse effects.",0.1660826951265335

Cough can impact quality of life, cause anxiety, and affect sleep in children and their parents. Honey has been used to alleviate cough symptoms. This is an update of reviews previously published in 2014, 2012, and 2010. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of honey for acute cough in children in ambulatory settings. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2018, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (2014 to 8 February 2018), Embase (2014 to 8 February 2018), CINAHL (2014 to 8 February 2018), EBSCO (2014 to 8 February 2018), Web of Science (2014 to 8 February 2018), and LILACS (2014 to 8 February 2018). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) on 12 February 2018. The 2014 review included searches of AMED and CAB Abstracts, but these were not searched for this update due to lack of institutional access. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing honey alone, or in combination with antibiotics, versus no treatment, placebo, honey-based cough syrup, or other over-the-counter cough medications for children aged 12 months to 18 years for acute cough in ambulatory settings. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results: We included six randomised controlled trials involving 899 children; we added three studies (331 children) in this update.We assessed two studies as at high risk of performance and detection bias; three studies as at unclear risk of attrition bias; and three studies as at unclear risk of other bias.Studies compared honey with dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, salbutamol, bromelin (an enzyme from the Bromeliaceae (pineapple) family), no treatment, and placebo. Five studies used 7-point Likert scales to measure symptomatic relief of cough; one used an unclear 5-point scale. In all studies, low score indicated better cough symptom relief.Using a 7-point Likert scale, honey probably reduces cough frequency better than no treatment or placebo (no treatment: mean difference (MD) -1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.48 to -0.62; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 154 children; moderate-certainty evidence; placebo: MD -1.62, 95% CI -3.02 to -0.22; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 402 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Honey may have a similar effect as dextromethorphan in reducing cough frequency (MD -0.07, 95% CI -1.07 to 0.94; I² = 87%; 2 studies; 149 children; low-certainty evidence). Honey may be better than diphenhydramine in reducing cough frequency (MD -0.57, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.24; 1 study; 80 children; low-certainty evidence).Giving honey for up to three days is probably more effective in relieving cough symptoms compared with placebo or salbutamol. Beyond three days honey probably had no advantage over salbutamol or placebo in reducing cough severity, bothersome cough, and impact of cough on sleep for parents and children (moderate-certainty evidence). With a 5-point cough scale, there was probably little or no difference between the effects of honey and bromelin mixed with honey in reducing cough frequency and severity.Adverse events included nervousness, insomnia, and hyperactivity, experienced by seven children (9.3%) treated with honey and two children (2.7%) treated with dextromethorphan (risk ratio (RR) 2.94, 95% Cl 0.74 to 11.71; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 149 children; low-certainty evidence). Three children (7.5%) in the diphenhydramine group experienced somnolence (RR 0.14, 95% Cl 0.01 to 2.68; 1 study; 80 children; low-certainty evidence). When honey was compared with placebo, 34 children (12%) in the honey group and 13 (11%) in the placebo group complained of gastrointestinal symptoms (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.24; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 402 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Four children who received salbutamol had rashes compared to one child in the honey group (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.63; 1 study; 100 children; moderate-certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported in the no-treatment group. Authors' conclusions: Honey probably relieves cough symptoms to a greater extent than no treatment, diphenhydramine, and placebo, but may make little or no difference compared to dextromethorphan. Honey probably reduces cough duration better than placebo and salbutamol. There was no strong evidence for or against using honey. Most of the children received treatment for one night, which is a limitation to the results of this review. There was no difference in occurrence of adverse events between the honey and control arms.",0.25604286789894104

Design: A survey was administered to parents on 2 consecutive days, first on the day of presentation when no medication had been given the prior evening and then the next day when honey, honey-flavored DM, or no treatment had been given prior to bedtime according to a partially double-blinded randomization scheme. Setting: A single, outpatient, general pediatric practice. Participants: One hundred five children aged 2 to 18 years with upper respiratory tract infections, nocturnal symptoms, and illness duration of 7 days or less. Intervention: A single dose of buckwheat honey, honey-flavored DM, or no treatment administered 30 minutes prior to bedtime. Main outcome measures: Cough frequency, cough severity, bothersome nature of cough, and child and parent sleep quality. Results: Significant differences in symptom improvement were detected between treatment groups, with honey consistently scoring the best and no treatment scoring the worst. In paired comparisons, honey was significantly superior to no treatment for cough frequency and the combined score, but DM was not better than no treatment for any outcome. Comparison of honey with DM revealed no significant differences. Conclusions: In a comparison of honey, DM, and no treatment, parents rated honey most favorably for symptomatic relief of their child's nocturnal cough and sleep difficulty due to upper respiratory tract infection. Honey may be a preferable treatment for the cough and sleep difficulty associated with childhood upper respiratory tract infection.

Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing honey given alone, or in combination with antibiotics, versus nothing, placebo or other over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications to participants aged from one to 18 years for acute cough in ambulatory settings. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened search results for eligible studies and extracted data on reported outcomes. Main results: We included three RCTs, two at high risk of bias and one at low risk of bias, involving 568 children. The studies compared honey with dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, 'no treatment' and placebo for the effect on symptomatic relief of cough using a seven-point Likert scale. The lower the score, the better the cough symptom being assessed.Moderate quality evidence showed that honey may be better than 'no treatment' in reducing the frequency of cough (mean difference (MD) -1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.48 to -0.62; I(2) statistic 23%; two studies, 154 participants). High quality evidence also suggests that honey may be better than placebo for reduction of cough frequency (MD -1.85; 95% Cl -3.36 to -0.33; one study, 300 participants). Moderate quality evidence suggests that honey does not differ significantly from dextromethorphan in reducing cough frequency (MD -0.07; 95% CI -1.07 to 0.94; two studies, 149 participants). Low quality evidence suggests that honey may be slightly better than diphenhydramine in reducing cough frequency (MD -0.57; 95% CI -0.90 to -0.24; one study, 80 participants).Adverse events included mild reactions (nervousness, insomnia and hyperactivity) experienced by seven children (9.3%) from the honey group and two (2.7%) from the dextromethorphan group; the difference was not significant (risk ratio (RR) 2.94; 95% Cl 0.74 to 11.71; two studies, 149 participants). Three children (7.5%) in the diphenhydramine group experienced somnolence (RR 0.14; 95% Cl 0.01 to 2.68; one study, 80 participants). When honey was compared with placebo, four children (1.8%) in the honey group and one (1.3%) from the placebo group complained of gastrointestinal symptoms (RR 1.33; 95% Cl 0.15 to 11.74). However, there was no significant difference between honey versus dextromethorphan, honey versus diphenhydramine or honey versus placebo. No adverse event was reported in the 'no treatment' group. Authors' conclusions: Honey may be better than 'no treatment', diphenhydramine and placebo for the symptomatic relief of cough, but it is not better than dextromethorphan.

19,2019,20618098,Can honey offer relief from cough symptoms in children?,honey children cough,1.0,"Objectives: Coughing is a prevalent symptom of upper respiratory infections (URIs) that cause disturbance in the sleep of children and their parents. There is as yet no reliable treatment to control URIs and their related cough; however, drugs such as dextromethorphan (DM) and diphenhydramine (DPH) are now mainly used in the world. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of honey, DM, and DPH on the nightly cough and sleep quality of children and their parents. Design: This was a clinical trial study in which 139 children aged 24-60 months suffering from coughing due to URIs were selected and assigned randomly to 4 groups. The first group received honey (HG), the second one DM (DMG), the third DPH (DPHG), but the fourth group or control group (CG) was assigned to a supportive treatment. Outcome measures: After approximately a 24-hour intervention, the 4 groups were reexamined and their cough frequency, cough severity, and sleep quality in children and their parents were recorded by using the questionnaire with Likert-type questions. Results: The mean of cough frequency score HG is 4.09 +/- 0.72 and 1.93 +/- 0.65 before and after the intervention, respectively, while these figures for the CG are 4.11 +/- 0.78 and 3.11 +/- 0.57, respectively. After the intervention, the difference of the mean score of the variables in all groups became statistically significant. The mean score of all variables in HG has stood significantly higher than those in other groups. There is also a significant relationship between the DMG and CG groups, even though there is no statistically difference between DMG and DPHG groups. Conclusions: The result of the study demonstrated that receiving a 2.5-mL dose of honey before sleep has a more alleviating effect on URIs-induced cough compared with DM and DPH doses.",0.3971285820007324

There is almost no day without a child being examined for upper respiratory tract infection and cough. While I understand that no medications are recommended for relief of cough—prescribed or over the counter—is it true that honey might help relieve cough symptoms in children? Answer Most prescribed and over-the-counter preparations for cough in children are not effective and might carry the risk of adverse events. A single dose of honey before bedtime was shown in recent studies to diminish cough and the discomfort experienced by children and their parents. Recent evidence also supports administering a few daily doses, but this practice will need further study to assess its effectiveness and safety.",0.07144080102443695
19,2019,27457790,Can honey offer relief from cough symptoms in children?,honey children cough,1.0,"Background: Available pediatric treatments for acute cough are limited by lack of demonstrated efficacy. The objective of this trial is to compare the effects of a polysaccharide-resin-honey based cough syrup, and carbocysteine syrups on nocturnal and daytime cough associated with childhood upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Methods: Using a single-blind randomization design, the study recruited children from 4 general pediatric community clinics. Participants included 150 children aged 2 to 5 years with an URI, nocturnal and daytime cough and illness duration of ≤7 days. To be eligible, children had to be free of medication on the day before presentation. A survey was administered to parents on 4 consecutive days beginning from the day of presentation in clinic. Children received the study preparation on the first evening and then 3 times per day for 3 further days. Main outcome measures were cough frequency, cough severity, bothersome nature of cough, and quality of sleep for both child and parent. Results: Both preparations were well tolerated and cough improved over the study period. After one night and on all survey days, there was a significantly better result for polysaccharide-resin-honey (P 0.05) for all the main outcome measures. The trend of improvement over the 4 days was steeper for polysaccharide-resin-honey (P 0.05) with regards to all cough parameters. Conclusions: Both polysaccharide-resin-honey and carbocysteine cough syrups were well tolerated in children over 2 years of age. The polysaccharide-resin-honey syrup was associated with a more rapid and greater improvement in all clinical cough symptoms measured, beginning from the first night of therapy. Both nocturnal and daytime cough improved, as did sleep quality for both children and parents.",0.3554403781890869

Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2011) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1950 to December week 4, 2011); EMBASE (1990 to January 2012); CINAHL (1981 to January 2012); Web of Science (2000 to January 2012); AMED (1985 to January 2012); LILACS (1982 to January 2012); and CAB abstracts (2009 to January 2012). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing honey given alone, or in combination with antibiotics, versus nothing, placebo or other over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications to participants aged from two to 18 years for acute cough in ambulatory settings. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened search results for eligible studies and extracted data on reported outcomes. Main results: We included two RCTs of high risk of bias involving 265 children. The studies compared the effect of honey with dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine and 'no treatment' on symptomatic relief of cough using the 7-point Likert scale. Honey was better than 'no treatment' in reducing frequency of cough (mean difference (MD) -1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.53 to -0.60; two studies; 154 participants). Moderate quality evidence suggests honey did not differ significantly from dextromethorphan in reducing cough frequency (MD -0.07; 95% CI -1.07 to 0.94; two studies; 149 participants). Low quality evidence suggests honey may be slightly better than diphenhydramine in reducing cough frequency (MD -0.57; 95% CI -0.90 to -0.24; one study; 80 participants). Adverse events included mild reactions (nervousness, insomnia and hyperactivity) experienced by seven children (9.3%) from the honey group and two (2.7%) from the dextromethorphan group; the difference was not significant (risk ratio (RR) 2.94; 95% Cl 0.74 to 11.71; two studies; 149 participants). Three children (7.5%) in the diphenhydramine group experienced somnolence (RR 0.14; 95% Cl 0.01 to 2.68; one study; 80 participants) but there was no significant difference between honey versus dextromethorphan or honey versus diphenhydramine. No adverse event was reported in the 'no treatment' group. Authors' conclusions: Honey may be better than 'no treatment' and diphenhydramine in the symptomatic relief of cough but not better than dextromethorphan. There is no strong evidence for or against the use of honey.",0.27946463227272034

Methods: A survey was administered to parents on 2 consecutive days, first on the day of presentation, when no medication had been given the previous evening, and the following day, when the study preparation was given before bedtime, based on a double-blind randomization plan. Participants included 300 children aged 1 to 5 years with URIs, nocturnal cough, and illness duration of ≤ 7 days from 6 general pediatric community clinics. Eligible children received a single dose of 10 g of eucalyptus honey, citrus honey, labiatae honey, or placebo administered 30 minutes before bedtime. Main outcome measures were cough frequency, cough severity, bothersome nature of cough, and child and parent sleep quality. Results: In all 3 honey products and the placebo group, there was a significant improvement from the night before treatment to the night of treatment. However, the improvement was greater in the honey groups for all the Conclusions: Parents rated the honey products higher than the silan date extract for symptomatic relief of their children's nocturnal cough and sleep difficulty due to URI.

Current available randomised clinical trials evaluated the effects of a single evening dose of honey, but multiple doses outcomes have never been studied. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of wildflower honey, given for three subsequent evenings, on non-specific acute paediatric cough, compared to dextromethorphan (DM) and levodropropizine (LDP), which are the most prescribed over-the-counter (OTC) antitussives in Italy. Methods: 134 children suffering from non-specific acute cough were randomised to receive for three subsequent evenings a mixture of milk (90ml) and wildflower honey (10ml) or a dose of DM or LDP adjusted for the specific age. The effectiveness was evaluated by a cough questionnaire answered by parents. Primary end-point efficacy was therapeutic success. The latter was defined as a decrease in cough questionnaire score greater than 50% after treatment compared with baseline values. Results: Three children were excluded from the study, as their parents did not complete the questionnaire. Therapeutic success was achieved by 80% in the honey and milk group and 87% in OTC medication group (p=0.25). Conclusions: Milk and honey mixture seems to be at least as effective as DM or LDP in non-specific acute cough in children. These results are in line with previous studies, which reported the health effects of honey on paediatric cough, even if placebo effect cannot be totally excluded.",0.2005641758441925
19,2019,19370690,Can honey offer relief from cough symptoms in children?,honey children cough,1.0,"Background: Chronic non-specific cough is a chronic, dry cough of in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology. Although it is usually not reflective of an underlying severe illness, it does cause significant morbidity, and as such relief from it is often sought. The use of honey and lozenges to soothe upper respiratory tract irritation is common, inexpensive, and potentially more effective in treating the symptoms than pharmacological interventions. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of honey and/or lozenges in the management of children with chronic non-specific cough. Search strategy: The Cochrane Airways Group searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE, and EMBASE databases in October 2008. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials comparing honey or lozenges with a placebo in treating children with chronic non-specific cough. Data collection and analysis: The results of the searches were assessed according to the pre-determined criteria. None of the trials identified by the searches were eligible for inclusion, leaving no data available for analysis in this review. Main results: The search did not provide any applicable randomised controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of honey and lozenges in treating children with non-specific chronic cough. Data from acute studies suggest a potential role for honey in relieving cough, but whether this is applicable to chronic cough is unknown. Authors' conclusions: Clinically, this review was unable to provide any justifiable recommendation for or against honey and/or lozenges due to the lack of evidence. The absence of applicable studies highlights the need for further research into the area of treating children with chronic non-specific coughs with honey and/or lozenges. These treatments are not recommended when managing very young children (as lozenges are a potential choking hazard, and honey may cause infant botulism in children under 1 year of age).",0.11564306914806366

Steroid treatment in the early hours after the injury is aimed at reducing the extent of permanent paralysis during the rest of the patient's life. Objectives: To review randomized trials of steroids for human acute spinal cord injury. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (searched 02 Aug 2011), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 2011, issue 3 (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (Ovid) 1948 to July Week 3 2011, EMBASE (Ovid) 1974 to 2011 week 17, ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) 1970 to Aug 2011, ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (CPCI-S) 1990 to Aug 2011 and PubMed [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/] (searched 04 Aug 2011) for records added to PubMed in the last 90 days). Files of the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) were reviewed (NASCIS was founded in 1977 and has tracked trials in this area since that date). We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and previously published reviews. Selection criteria: All randomized controlled trials of steroid treatment for acute spinal cord injury in any language. Data collection and analysis: One review author extracted data from trial reports. Japanese and French studies were found through NASCIS and additional data (e.g. SDs) were obtained from the original study authors. Main results: Eight trials are included in this review, seven used methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate has been shown to improve neurologic outcome up to one year post-injury if administered within eight hours of injury and in a dose regimen of: bolus 30mg/kg over 15 minutes, with maintenance infusion of 5.4 mg/kg per hour infused for 23 hours. The initial North American trial results were replicated in a Japanese trial but not in the one from France. Data was obtained from the latter studies to permit appropriate meta-analysis of all three trials. This indicated significant recovery in motor function after methylprednisolone therapy, when administration commenced within eight hours of injury. A more recent trial indicates that, if methylprednisolone therapy is given for an additional 24 hours (a total of 48 hours), additional improvement in motor neurologic function and functional status are observed. This is particularly observed if treatment cannot be started until between three to eight hours after injury. The same methylprednisolone therapy has been found effective in whiplash injuries. A modified regimen was found to improve recovery after surgery for lumbar disc disease. The risk of bias was low in the largest methyprednisolne trials. Overall, there was no evidence of significantly increased complications or mortality from the 23 or 48 hour therapy. Authors' conclusions: High-dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy is the only pharmacologic therapy shown to have efficacy in a phase three randomized trial when administered within eight hours of injury. One trial indicates additional benefit by extending the maintenance dose from 24 to 48 hours, if start of treatment must be delayed to between three and eight hours after injury.

20,2019,23454689,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,"Background: Acute spinal cord injury (ASCI) is a catastrophic event that can profoundly affect the trajectory of a patient's life. Debate continues over the pharmacologic management of ASCI, specifically, the widespread but controversial use of the steroid methylprednisolone (MP). Treatment efforts are impeded because of limitations in understanding of the pathobiology of ASCI and the difficulty in proving the efficacy of therapies. Methods: This review presents the pathophysiology of ASCI and the laboratory and clinical findings on the use of MP. Results: The use of MP remains a contentious issue in part because of the catastrophic nature of ASCI, the paucity of treatment options, and the legal ramifications. Although historical data on the use of MP in ASCI have been challenged, more recent studies have been used both to support and to oppose treatment of ASCI with steroids. Conclusions: ASCI is a devastating event with a complex aftermath of secondary damaging processes that worsen the initial injury. Although the results of NASCIS (National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study) II and III trials led to the widespread adoption of a high-dose MP regimen for patients treated within 8 hours of injury, subsequent studies have called into question the validity of NASCIS conclusions. Further evidence of the ineffectiveness of the MP protocol has led to declining confidence in the treatment over the last decade. At the present time, high-dose MP cannot be recommended as a standard of care, but it remains an option until supplanted by future evidence-based therapies.",0.06789791584014893

20,2019,32095652,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,"Introduction: The role for steroids in acute spinal cord injury (ASCI) remains unclear; while some studies have demonstrated the risks of steroids outweigh the benefits,a meta-analyses conducted on heterogeneous patient populations have shown significant motor improvement at short-term but not at long-term follow-up. Given the heterogeneity of the patient population in previous meta-analyses and the publication of a recent trial not included in these meta-analyses, we sought to re-assess and update the safety and short-term and long-term efficacy of steroid treatment following ASCI in a more homogeneous patient population. Materials and methods: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library through June 2019 for studies evaluating the utility of steroids within the first 8 h following ASCI. Neurological and safety outcomes were extracted for patients treated and not treated with steroids. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using the random-effects model. Results: Twelve studies, including five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and seven observational studies (OBSs), were meta-analyzed. Overall, methylprednisolone was not associated with significant short-term or long-term improvements in motor or neurological scores based on RCTs or OBSs. An increased risk of hyperglycemia was shown in both RCTs (RR: 13.7; 95% CI: 1.93, 97.4; 1 study) and OBSs (RR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.55, 5.41; 1 study). Risk for pneumonia was increased with steroids; while this increase was not statistically significant in the RCTs (pooled RR: 1.16; 95% C.I: 0.59, 2.29; 3 studies), it reached statistical significance in the OBSs (pooled RR: 2.00; 95% C.I: 1.32, 3.02; 6 studies). There was no statistically significant increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, decubitus ulcers, surgical site infections, sepsis, atelectasis, venous thromboembolism, urinary tract infections, or mortality among steroid-treated ASCI patients compared to untreated controls in either RCTs or OBSs. Conclusions: Methylprednisolone therapy within the first 8 h following ASCI failed to show a statistically significant short-term or long-term improvement in patients' overall motor or neurological scores compared to controls who were not administered steroids. For the same comparison, there was an increased risk of pneumonia and hyperglycemia compared to controls. Routine use of methylprednisone following ASCI should be carefully considered in the context of these results.",0.1163395568728447
20,2019,33684579,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,"Background: Acute spinal cord injury (ASCI) is a devastating event that can have a profound impact on the lives of patients and their families. While no definitive medical treatment exists, the role of methylprednisolone (MP) in the management of ASCI and other spinal cord pathologies has been investigated in depth; however, its use remains contentious. While MP initially showed promise in the efficacy of ASCI treatment, more recent studies have questioned its use citing numerous systemic adverse effects. Pharmacologic treatments in this area are poorly understood due to the scarcity of knowledge surrounding the pathophysiology and heterogeneity of patients presenting with these conditions. Despite these shortcomings and due to the lack of alternative treatment options, MP is still widely used by physicians. Methods: We review prior and current literature on the use of MP treatment for ASCI patients with a discussion of novel drug delivery systems that have demonstrated the potential to improve MP's bioavailability at the site of injury while minimizing systemic side effects. In addition, current views on the role of MP and dexamethasone in metastatic spinal cord compression and postoperative infection are reviewed. Results: While some data support benefits in the use of steroids on spinal cord pathology, extensive research suggests at best limited effects and an unresolvable risk/benefit problem. Conclusions: At present, evidence regarding use of dexamethasone for MSCC is contentious, especially regarding dose regiments. Ultimately, further investigation into the use of steroids is required to determine its utility in treating patients with spinal cord pathology.",0.31245967745780945

Objectives: The purpose of this article is to review the available literature and formulate evidence-based recommendations for the use of methylprednisone in the setting of acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Summary of background data: Since the early 1990s, methylprednisolone has become widely prescribed for the treatment of acute SCI. Arguably, it has become a standard of care. Methods: Through an electronic database search strategy and by cross-reference with published literature, appropriate clinical studies were identified. They were reviewed in chronologic order with respect to study design, outcome measures, results, and conclusions. Results: Nine studies were identified that attempted to evaluate the role of steroids in nonpenetrating (blunt) spinal cord injury. Five of these were Class I clinical trials, and four were Class II studies. All of the studies failed to demonstrate improvement because of steroid administration in any of the a priori hypotheses testing. Although post hoc analyses were interesting, they failed to demonstrate consistent significant treatment effects. Conclusions: From an evidence-based approach, methylprednisolone cannot be recommended for routine use in acute nonpenetrating SCI. Prolonged administration of high-dose steroids (48 hours) may be harmful to the patient. Until more evidence is forthcoming, methylprednisolone should be considered to have investigational (unproven) status only.",0.08510468155145645

Results: Over a period of 5 years, the prevalence of steroid administration in acute SCI has completely reversed; the proportion of steroid users declined from 73% to 27%. The main rationale for using it was belief in efficacy, rather than fear of litigation. The differences between specialization and age groups were not statistically significant in both administrations.

There are several treatment options available, both non-pharmacological (i.e. cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological. Among the pharmacological interventions, antidepressants, buspirone and benzodiazepines (BDZs) have been studied in GAD. Hydroxyzine is an anti-histamine medication which has been used in the treatment of anxiety. Objectives: 1. To determine the efficacy of hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent in alleviating the acute symptoms of GAD. 2. To review acceptability of treatment with hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent. 3. To investigate the adverse effects of hydroxyzine in comparison with other active agents. Search strategy: The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched on 1 March 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO and checked reference lists of included studies, previous systematic reviews and major textbooks of anxiety disorders. Personal communication with pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field was also undertaken. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with GAD to hydroxyzine versus placebo and/or any other anxiolytic agent. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (such as the number of patients who responded to treatment or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side effect profile). Main results: The search yielded 39 studies. We included five studies in the review with a total of 884 participants. We excluded 31 studies and designated three as awaiting assessment. The data from the included studies provide some evidence that hydroxyzine is more effective than placebo for GAD (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58) and that it is also acceptable/tolerable (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.58) (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.40). Compared to other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability (hydroxyzine vs chloridiazepoxide: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.62; hydroxyzine vs buspirone efficacy OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.42). In terms of side effects, hydroxyzine was associated with a higher rate of sleepiness/drowsiness than the active comparators (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.53). There was, however, a high risk of bias in the included studies. Authors' conclusions: The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol for this review.

Hydroxyzine, an antagonist of histamine receptors, showed both efficacy and safety in previous short-term double-blind studies over placebo in this pathology. The aim of the current study was to confirm those positive results over a 3-month period in adult outpatients. Method: This multicenter, parallel (hydroxyzine [50 mg/day]; bromazepam [6 mg/day]), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 2 weeks of single-blind run-in placebo, 12 weeks of double-blind randomized treatment, and 4 weeks of single-blind run-out placebo. Three hundred thirty-four of 369 selected outpatients with a diagnosis of GAD according to DSM-IV criteria and a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score &gt;/= 20 were randomized before entering the double-blind period. The primary outcome criterion was the change in the HAM-A score from baseline to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with hydroxyzine compared with placebo. Results: In the intent-to-treat analysis, the mean +/- SD change in HAM-A scores from baseline to endpoint was -12.16 +/- 7.74 for hydroxyzine and -9.64 +/- 7.74 for placebo (p =.019). Results at endpoint for percentage of responders (p =.003) and remission rates (p =.028), Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale score (p =.001), maintenance of efficacy (p =.022), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale score on day 84 (p =.008) also confirmed the efficacy of hydroxyzine over placebo. The study showed no statistically significant difference between hydroxyzine and bromazepam.

The statistical superiority for hydroxyzine continued to the end of the 4-weeks study period, and persisted at a further evaluation a week after abrupt discontinuation of active treatment. The tolerance evaluation showed that side effects were reported in 52% of hydroxyzine group versus 35% of placebo group. The most commun side effects were sleepiness (28% vs 14% with placebo), weight gain (12% vs 10%), dry mouth (14% vs 5%), loss of concentration (9% vs 8%) and insomnia (9% vs 6%). Sleepiness in the hydroxyzine group appeared during the first week and progressively disappeared later during treatment. We concluded that hydroxyzine at 50 mg/day produces a statistically and clinically significant anxiolytic effect, commencing during the first week of treatment and maintained throughout the 4-week period and after abrupt discontinuation without rebound of anxiety or withdrawal symptoms. The most commun side effect with hydroxyzine is transient sleepiness.",0.2221362143754959

Emerging data suggest that GAD has a chronic course and a high comorbidity with depression. Successful treatment can be facilitated by first establishing treatment goals, which include managing acute anxiety and following through to remission. Prevention of GAD recurrence should be the ultimate objective. Many treatments exist to aid in the realization of treatment goals, including benzodiazepines, hydroxyzine, buspirone, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Some SSRIs and an SNRI have been demonstrated effective in both acute and long-term trials, establishing them as first-line therapies. Benzodiazepines are helpful because of their rapid onset of action and efficacy in somatic and autonomic symptoms of GAD. Other medications in the pipeline include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulators, which may have lower abuse potential than currently available agents that act at the GABA receptor; corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) antagonists; and pregabalin. The recent realization of the chronic nature of GAD and the recognition of its frequent comorbidity with depression, coupled with data from randomized clinical trials of newer generation agents, should help physicians better diagnose GAD and achieve the goal of bringing patients to full remission.",0.14290183782577515

Antidepressants have long been viewed as promising alternatives to benzodiazepines for the treatment of some types of anxiety. Although they have been shown to be useful in the treatment of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder/social phobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, they have not until recently been regarded as potential therapies for GAD.

The level of relation, mood and sedation was assessed for each item with a visual analog scale (VAS). The patient's and investigator's opinion on the global efficiency of the treatment were also evaluated on VAS.

27,2019,30062732,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,"Background: Cough is a frequent symptom presenting to doctors. The most common cause of childhood chronic (greater than fours weeks' duration) wet cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in some settings, although other more serious causes can also present this way. Timely and effective management of chronic wet or productive cough improves quality of life and clinical outcomes. Current international guidelines suggest a course of antibiotics is the first treatment of choice in the absence of signs or symptoms specific to an alternative diagnosis. This review sought to clarify the current evidence to support this recommendation. Objectives: To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with prolonged wet cough (excluding children with bronchiectasis or other known underlying respiratory illness) and to assess risk of harm due to adverse events. Search methods: We undertook an updated search (from 2008 onwards) using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, trials registries, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest searches were performed in September 2017. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic wet cough. We excluded cluster and cross-over trials. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane. We reviewed results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two independent review authors selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors of eligible studies for further information as needed. We analysed data as 'intention to treat.' Main results: We identified three studies as eligible for inclusion in the review. Two were in the previous review and one new study was included. We considered the older studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias whereas we judged the newly included study at low risk of bias. The studies varied in treatment duration (from 7 to 14 days) and the antibiotic used (two studies used amoxicillin/clavulanate acid and one used erythromycin).We included 190 children (171 completed), mean ages ranged from 21 months to six years, in the meta-analyses. Analysis of all three trials (190 children) found that treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31, using intention-to -treat analysis), which translated to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). We identified no significant heterogeneity (for both fixed-effect and random-effects model the I² statistic was 0%). Two older trials assessed progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics (125 children), which was significantly lower in the antibiotic group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.34; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). All three trials (190 children) reported adverse events, which were not significantly increased in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.69). We assessed the quality of evidence GRADE rating as moderate for all outcome measures, except adverse events which we assessed as low quality. Authors' conclusions: Evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious for the treatment of children with chronic wet cough (greater than four weeks) with an NNTB of three. However, antibiotics have adverse effects and this review reported only uncertainty as to the risk of increased adverse effects when they were used in this setting. The inclusion of a more robust study strengthened the previous Cochrane review and its results.",0.22868560254573822

Methods: All chest multi-detector computerised tomography (MDCT) scans at a single paediatric tertiary hospital from April 2010 to August 2012 were reviewed retrospectively so as to identify those ordered by respiratory physicians for assessment of children with a chronic wet cough. Information regarding age, sex, ethnicity, indication for imaging and the response to at least 4 weeks of antibiotics before having the scan were recorded from their charts. The data were analysed using simple and multiple logistic regression. Results: Of the 144 (87 males) eligible children, 106 (65 males, 30 Indigenous) aged 10-199 months had MDCT scan evidence of bronchiectasis. Antibiotic data were available for 129 children. Among the 105 children with persistent cough despite at least 4 weeks of antibiotics, 88 (83.8%) had bronchiectasis, while of the 24 children whose cough resolved after antibiotics, only six (25.0%) received this diagnosis (adjusted OR 20.9; 95% CI 5.36 to 81.8). Being Indigenous was also independently associated with radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis (adjusted OR 5.86; 95% CI 1.20 to 28.5). Conclusions: Further investigations including a MDCT scan should be considered in a child with a chronic wet cough that persists following 4 weeks of oral antibiotics.

Guidelines recommend treatment with antibiotics as their effectiveness has been proven. However, factors associated with duration of cough in response to antibiotics in children with chronic wet cough have not been prospectively examined. Objective: To determine if demographic, clinical and/or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) factors are associated with ""time to cough resolution"" in children with chronic wet cough treated with antibiotics after bronchoscopy. Methods: Data from children with chronic wet cough treated with antibiotics after bronchoscopy were extracted from a prospective cohort study database. Cough dairies were used to determine when the cough resolved. Associations between various factors with ""time to cough resolution"" were examined using regression. Results: The median age of the 133 children was 2.4 years (interquartile range, 1.4-4.9). Duration of prior cough at bronchoscopy was significantly positively related with ""time to cough resolution"" (β = .010; 95% confidence interval, 0.004-0.017; P = .002). This translated to; for each month of prior cough, it took an extra 1.02 days to achieve cough resolution while on antibiotic treatment. Gender, age, diagnosis, tobacco smoke exposure, pneumonia history, blood cellularity, and BAL cellular and microbiology profiles were not significantly associated with time to cough resolution. Conclusion: In children with chronic wet cough, duration of cough before antibiotic treatment is a small but significant determinant of ""time to cough resolution.""

The majority of children with chronic wet cough have protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), a recognised condition in multiple national guidelines. The authors conducted a parallel 1:1 placebo randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that a 2-week course of amoxycillin clavulanate is efficacious in the treatment of children with chronic wet cough. Methods: 50 children (median age 1.9 years, IQR 0.9-5.1) with chronic (&gt;3 weeks) wet cough were randomised to 2 weeks of twice daily oral amoxycillin clavulanate (22.5 mg/kg/dose) or placebo. The primary outcome was 'cough resolution' defined as a &gt;75% reduction in the validated verbal category descriptive cough score within 14 days of treatment compared with baseline scores, or cessation of cough for &gt;3 days. In selected children, flexible bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were undertaken at baseline. Results: Cough resolution rates (48%) were significantly higher in children who received amoxycillin clavulanate compared with those who received placebo (16%), p=0.016. The observed difference between proportions was 0.32 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.56). Post treatment, median verbal category descriptive score in the amoxycillin clavulanate group of 0.5 (IQR 0.0-2.0) was significantly lower than in the placebo group, 2.25 (IQR 1.15-2.9) (p=0.02). Pre-treatment BAL data were consistent with PBB in the majority of children, with no significant difference between groups. Conclusion: A 2-week course of amoxycillin clavulanate will achieve cough resolution in a significant number of children with chronic wet cough.

We formulated recommendations based on systematic reviews related to the management of chronic wet cough in children (aged ≤ 14 years) based on two key questions: (1) how effective are antibiotics in improving the resolution of cough? If so, what antibiotic should be used and for how long? and (2) when should children be referred for further investigations? Methods: We used the CHEST expert cough panel's protocol for systematic reviews and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and GRADE framework (the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus for the recommendations/suggestions made. Results: Combining data from the systematic reviews, we found high-quality evidence in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (&gt; 4 weeks' duration) wet/productive cough that using appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution, and further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be undertaken when specific cough pointers (eg, digital clubbing) are present. When the wet cough does not improve following 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, there is moderate-quality evidence that further investigations should be considered to look for an underlying disease.

Protracted bacterial bronchitis is a frequent cause of morbidity in childhood, and antibiotic treatment is beneficial. Prompt recognition and early treatment is important both to prevent inappropriate use of asthma medications and also progression to bronchiectasis, but the diagnosis should not be made uncritically, because chronic wet cough is not necessarily due to lower airway disease. Upper Airway Cough Syndrome (UACS) is considered by some to cause chronic cough in childhood. Underlying UACS are many common conditions, including allergic rhinitis, adenoiditis and rhinosinusitis. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical criteria that are relatively sensitive but non-specific. The role of nasal endoscopy in children with chronic cough and signs suggesting UACS is unclear. Nasal saline solution irrigation is commonly used in UACS, but most studies have methodological biases, and efficacy data are scanty. Randomized controlled trials are urgently required. However, if saline washes, rather than oral antibiotics, can effectively treat some children with wet cough associated with upper airway conditions, antibiotic resistance could potentially be reduced. There is a need to further study wet cough and not to assume it to be equivalent to lower airway infection in all children.",0.09142455458641052

In the absence of any community prevalence data, and with the high burden of respiratory disease and the European Respiratory Society task force's recommendation to identify disease burden, we determined the prevalence of chronic wet cough and PBB in young Aboriginal children in four remote communities in north Western Australia. Methods: A whole-population, prospective study was conducted. Aboriginal children aged ≤7 years were clinically assessed for chronic wet cough by paediatric respiratory clinicians between July 2018 and May 2019. Where children had a wet cough but parents reported a short or uncertain cough duration, children were followed up 1 month later.

27,2019,34048716,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,"Background: Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a leading cause of chronic wet cough in children. The current standard treatment in European and American guidelines is 2 weeks of antibiotics, but the optimal duration of therapy is unknown. We describe the first randomised controlled trial to assess the duration of antibiotic treatment in children with chronic wet cough and suspected PBB. We hypothesise that 4 weeks of amoxicillin-clavulanate is superior to 2 weeks for improving clinical outcomes. Methods: Our parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial was completed in four Australian hospitals. Children aged 2 months to 19 years with chronic (&gt;4 weeks duration) wet cough, and suspected PBB were randomly assigned (1:1) using permuted block randomisation (stratified by age and site) to 4 weeks of amoxicillin-clavulanate (25-35 mg/kg twice daily oral suspension; 4-week group) or 2 weeks of amoxicillin-clavulanate followed by 2 weeks of placebo (2-week group). The children, caregivers, all the study coordinators, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment until data analysis was completed. The primary outcome was clinical cure (cough resolution) by day 28. Secondary outcomes were recurrence of PBB at 6 months, time to next exacerbation, change in Parent-proxy Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life (PC-QoL) score from baseline to day 28 and from day 28 to 7 months, adverse events, nasal swab bacteriology, and antimicrobial resistance. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. This trial is complete and registered with Australian/New Zealand Registry, ACTRN12616001725459. Findings: Between March 8, 2017, and Sept 30, 2019, 106 children were randomly assigned (52 in the 4-week group, median age 2·2 years [IQR 1·3-4·1]; 54 in the 2-week group, median age 1·7 years [1·2-3·8]) with 90 children completing the 4-week treatment. By day 28, the primary endpoint of clinical cure in the 4-week group (32 [62%] of 52 patients) was not significantly different to the 2-week group (38 [70%] of 54 patients; adjusted relative risk 0·87 [95% CI 0·60 to 1·28]; p=0·49). Time to next wet cough exacerbation was significantly longer in the 4-week group than the 2-week group (median 150 days [IQR 38-181] vs 36 days [15-181]; adjusted hazard ratio 0·47 [0·25 to 0·90]; p=0·02). The rate of recurrence of PBB at 6 months was 17 (53%) of 32 patients in the 4-week group vs 28 (74%) of 38 patients in the 2-week group, but the difference between the groups was not significant (adjusted odds ratio 0·39 [0·14 to 1·04]; p=0·07). PC-QoL significantly improved from baseline to day 28 in both groups, but there was no significant difference between them (mean difference in change -0·2 [95% CI -1·0 to 0·6]; p=0·64). From day 28 to 7 months, median PC-QoL remained stable in both groups with no difference in change between them. Data on respiratory pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (paired swabs available for 48 children) were similar between groups. Adverse events occurred in 13 (25%) children in the 2-week group and ten (19%) in the 4-week group (p=0·57). Interpretation: A 4-week course of amoxicillin-clavulanate for treating children with chronic wet cough and suspected PBB confers little advantage compared with a 2-week course in achieving clinical cure by 28 days. However, as a 4-week duration led to a longer cough-free period, identifying children who would benefit from a longer antibiotic course is a priority.

The quality of the trials was variable.Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three to five days, or clarithromycin or erythromycin for seven days) were as effective as long-term (erythromycin for 10 to 14 days) in eradicating Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx (relative risk (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05), but had fewer side effects (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for seven days was also effective. Nor were there differences in clinical outcomes or microbiological relapse between short and long-term antibiotics. Contact prophylaxis of contacts older than six months of age with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases developing culture-positive B. pertussis. Authors' conclusions: Although antibiotics were effective in eliminating B. pertussis, they did not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness.

Infants are the population at highest risk of severe disease and death. Erythromycin for 14 days is recommended for treatment and contact prophylaxis but this regime is considered inconvenient and prolonged. The value of contact prophylaxis is uncertain. Objectives: To study the benefits and risks of antibiotic treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough. Search strategy: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2004); EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2003); conference abstracts and reference lists of articles were searched. Study investigators and pharmaceutical companies were approached for additional information (published or unpublished studies). There were no constraints based on language or publication status. Selection criteria: All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough were included in the systematic review. Data collection and analysis: At least three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial. Main results: Twelve trials with 1,720 participants met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials investigated treatment regimens and two investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. Results showed that short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three days, clarithromycin for seven days, or erythromycin estolate for seven days) were equally effective with long-term antibiotic treatment (erythromycin estolate or erythromycin for 14 days) in the microbiological eradication of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx. The relative risk (RR) was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05). Side effects were fewer with short-term treatment (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). There were no differences in clinical improvement or microbiological relapse between short and long-term treatment regimens. Contact prophylaxis (of contacts older than six months of age) with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases that developed culture positive B. pertussis. Authors' conclusions: Antibiotics are effective in eliminating B. pertussis from patients with the disease, rendering them non-infectious, but do not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. Effective regimens include: three days of azithromycin, seven days of clarithromycin, seven or 14 days of erythromycin estolate, and 14 days of erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Considering microbiological clearance and side effects, three days of azithromycin or seven days of clarithromycin are the best regimens. Seven days of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole also appeared to be effective for the eradication of B. pertussis from the nasopharynx and may serve as an alternative antibiotic treatment for patients who cannot tolerate a macrolide.

Little is reported about the antibiotic resistance patterns and mechanism of drug resistance of Bordetella parapertussis. The objective of this study has been to investigate antimicrobial resistance, distribution of integrons and presence of gene cassettes to quinolones (qnr) and sulfonamides (sul) among B. parapertussis strains' isolated from Pakistan. Thirty-five (35) samples were collected from various hospitals of Pakistan from children (median age 3 years) with pertussis-like symptoms, all were tested and confirmed to be B. Parapertussis. Resistance profile of Ampicillin, Cephalexin, Sulphamethoxazole, Chloramphenicol, Ofloxacin, Nalidixic acid, Gentamycin and Erythromycin were investigated through all samples. Majority of the isolates were found to be resistant to the afore-mentioned antibiotics except erythromycin. All isolates were resistant to quinolones phenotypically, but qnr genes were detected in only 25.7% (9/35) of isolates. On the other hand, 71.4% (25/35) isolates were resistant to sulfonamides phenotypically. From these 71% strains showing phenotypical resistance, 96% (24/25) were found to possess sul genes. Only two isolates were carrying class 1 integrons, which also harbored sul gene and qnr gene cassettes. It can be safely concluded that the phenotypic resistance patterns seemed mostly independent of presence of integrons. However, interestingly both integrons harboring strains were resistant to quinolones and sulfonamides and also possessed qnr and sul genes.",0.48310422897338867

Methods: Patients with whooping cough was diagnosed by culture of nasopharynx swabs between January 2016 to December 2018. B. pertussis was identified using specific antisera against pertussis and parapertussis. Drug susceptibility test was carried out using the E-test method. The clearance of B. pertussis in nasopharynx at 7 and 14 days into and posttreatment with macrolides, and β-lactams was compared. Results: A total of 125 B. pertussis samples were collected from patients who received single antibiotic treatment. Among those isolates, 62.4% (78/125) had high resistance with minimum inhibitory concentrations greater than 256 mg/L for erythromycin and azithromycin. The MIC90 of piperacillin, cefoperazone-sulbactam, meropenem, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for these isolates was 0.016, 0.094, 0.094, 0.19, 0.19, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/L, respectively. The clearance rate with β-lactams treatment (68.8%, 44/64) was significantly higher than that with macrolides treatment at 14 days posttreatment (50.8%, 31/61) (χ2 = 4.18, P = 0.04). Macrolides had a better clearance rate at 7 days posttreatment than β-lactams (χ2 = 4.49, P = 0.03) for macrolides-sensitive isolates and a worse clearance rate for macrolides-resistant isolates. Conclusion: B. pertussis isolates had a high-resistant rate for macrolides in our study. Macrolides are the first choice for treating pertussis caused by macrolides-sensitive strains, and some β-lactams such as piperacillin should be considered as alternative antibiotics for treatment of macrolides-resistant B. pertussis infection.",0.30379870533943176

Negative nasopharyngeal cultures were usually associated with either a history of antibiotic therapy with erythromycin or tetracycline (two of three patients), two or more diphtheria and tetanus toxoids with pertussis (DTP) vaccines (six of eight patients), or both (two of three patients). Erythromycin therapy resulted in the elimination of B. pertussis from the nasopharynx in 2 to 7 days (mean, 3.6 days) compared with 7 to 17 or more days (mean, greater than 12 days) in patients treated with no antibiotics, but had no effect on the duration or severity of illness as judged by length of hospitalization. Adenoviruses were recovered from five of 44 patients cultured. Four of these isolates were from throat swabs obtained early in the illness and the remaining isolate was from one of 33 repeated viral cultures obtained two to three weeks later; B. pertussis was also isolated from these five patients. Paired serum samples were obtained from only two of these patients. Neither demonstrated a fourfold rise in adenoviral complement-fixing antibodies.

Methods: We conducted a comparative effectiveness study of children aged ≥6 months hospitalized at The Johns Hopkins Hospital who received short-course (5-7 days) vs prolonged-course (8-14 days) antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated CAP between 2012 and 2018 using an inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis. Inclusion was limited to children with clinical and radiographic criteria consistent with CAP, as adjudicated by 2 infectious diseases physicians. Children with tracheostomies; healthcare-associated, hospital-acquired, or ventilator-associated pneumonia; loculated or moderate to large pleural effusion or pulmonary abscess; intensive care unit stay &gt;48 hours; cystic fibrosis/bronchiectasis; severe immunosuppression; or unusual pathogens were excluded. The primary outcome was treatment failure, a composite of unanticipated emergency department visits, outpatient visits, hospital readmissions, or death (all determined to be likely attributable to bacterial pneumonia) within 30 days after completing antibiotic therapy. Results: Four hundred and thirty-nine patients met eligibility criteria; 168 (38%) patients received short-course therapy (median, 6 days) and 271 (62%) received prolonged-course therapy (median, 10 days). Four percent of children experienced treatment failure, with no differences observed between patients who received short-course vs prolonged-course antibiotic therapy (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, .18-1.30).

29,2019,35040920,Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,antibiotics children pneumonia,1.0,"Importance: Childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is usually treated with 10 days of antibiotics. Shorter courses may be effective with fewer adverse effects and decreased potential for antibiotic resistance. Objective: To compare a short (5-day) vs standard (10-day) antibiotic treatment strategy for CAP in young children. Design, setting, and participants: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in outpatient clinic, urgent care, or emergency settings in 8 US cities. A total of 380 healthy children aged 6 to 71 months with nonsevere CAP demonstrating early clinical improvement were enrolled from December 2, 2016, to December 16, 2019. Data were analyzed from January to September 2020. Intervention: On day 6 of their originally prescribed therapy, participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 5 days of matching placebo or 5 additional days of the same antibiotic. Main outcomes and measures: The primary end point was the end-of-treatment response adjusted for duration of antibiotic risk (RADAR), a composite end point that ranks each child's clinical response, resolution of symptoms, and antibiotic-associated adverse effects in an ordinal desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR). Within each DOOR rank, participants were further ranked by the number of antibiotic days, assuming that shorter antibiotic durations were more desirable. Using RADAR, the probability of a more desirable outcome was estimated for the short- vs standard-course strategy. In a subset of children, throat swabs were collected between study days 19 and 25 to quantify antibiotic resistance genes in oropharyngeal flora. Results: A total of 380 children (189 randomized to short course and 191 randomized to standard course) made up the study population. The mean (SD) age was 35.7 (17.2) months, and 194 participants (51%) were male. Of the included children, 8 were Asian, 99 were Black or African American, 234 were White, 32 were multiracial, and 7 were of unknown or unreported race; 33 were Hispanic or Latino, 344 were not Hispanic or Latino, and 3 were of unknown or unreported ethnicity. There were no differences between strategies in the DOOR or its individual components. Fewer than 10% of children in either strategy had an inadequate clinical response. The short-course strategy had a 69% (95% CI, 63-75) probability of a more desirable RADAR outcome compared with the standard-course strategy. A total of 171 children were included in the resistome analysis. The median (range) number of antibiotic resistance genes per prokaryotic cell (RGPC) was significantly lower in the short-course strategy compared with the standard-course strategy for total RGPC (1.17 [0.35-2.43] vs 1.33 [0.46-11.08]; P = .01) and β-lactamase RGPC (0.55 [0.18-1.24] vs 0.60 [0.21-2.45]; P = .03). Conclusions and relevance: In this study, among children responding to initial treatment for outpatient CAP, a 5-day antibiotic strategy was superior to a 10-day strategy.

Most of our understanding of hospital-acquired pneumonia in children is derived from adult studies. To our knowledge, no systematic review with meta-analysis has assessed the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens in neonates and children with hospital-acquired pneumonia. Objectives: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens for hospital-acquired pneumonia in neonates and children. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trial registers to February 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria: We included randomised clinical trials comparing one antibiotic regimen with any other antibiotic regimen for hospital-acquired pneumonia in neonates and children. Data collection and analysis: Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events; our secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, pneumonia-related mortality, non-serious adverse events, and treatment failure. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow-up. Main results: We included four randomised clinical trials (84 participants). We assessed all trials as having high risk of bias. We did not conduct any meta-analyses, as the included trials did not compare similar antibiotic regimens. Each of the four trials assessed a different comparison, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. Only one trial reported our primary outcomes of all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Three trials reported our secondary outcome of treatment failure. Two trials primarily included community-acquired pneumonia and hospitalised children with bacterial infections, hence the children with hospital-acquired pneumonia constituted subgroups of the total sample sizes. Where outcomes were reported, the certainty of the evidence was very low for each of the comparisons. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. None of the included trials assessed health-related quality of life, pneumonia-related mortality, or non-serious adverse events. Authors' conclusions: The relative beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the very low certainty of the available evidence. The current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another.

Objective: To determine whether lower-dose amoxicillin is noninferior to higher dose and whether 3-day treatment is noninferior to 7 days. Design, setting, and participants: Multicenter, randomized, 2 × 2 factorial noninferiority trial enrolling 824 children, aged 6 months and older, with clinically diagnosed CAP, treated with amoxicillin on discharge from emergency departments and inpatient wards of 28 hospitals in the UK and 1 in Ireland between February 2017 and April 2019, with last trial visit on May 21, 2019. Interventions: Children were randomized 1:1 to receive oral amoxicillin at a lower dose (35-50 mg/kg/d; n = 410) or higher dose (70-90 mg/kg/d; n = 404), for a shorter duration (3 days; n = 413) or a longer duration (7 days; n = 401). Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory infection within 28 days after randomization. The noninferiority margin was 8%. Secondary outcomes included severity/duration of 9 parent-reported CAP symptoms, 3 antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. Results: Of 824 participants randomized into 1 of the 4 groups, 814 received at least 1 dose of trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6-2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females), and the primary outcome was available for 789 (97%). For lower vs higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% with lower dose vs 12.4% with higher dose (difference, 0.2% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 4.0%]), and in 12.5% with 3-day treatment vs 12.5% with 7-day treatment (difference, 0.1% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 3.9]). Both groups demonstrated noninferiority with no significant interaction between dose and duration (P = .63). Of the 14 prespecified secondary end points, the only significant differences were 3-day vs 7-day treatment for cough duration (median 12 days vs 10 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = .04) and sleep disturbed by cough (median, 4 days vs 4 days; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = .03). Among the subgroup of children with severe CAP, the primary end point occurred in 17.3% of lower-dose recipients vs 13.5% of higher-dose recipients (difference, 3.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to10%]; P value for interaction = .18) and in 16.0% with 3-day treatment vs 14.8% with 7-day treatment (difference, 1.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 7.4%]; P value for interaction = .73). Conclusions and relevance: Among children with CAP discharged from an emergency department or hospital ward (within 48 hours), lower-dose outpatient oral amoxicillin was noninferior to higher dose, and 3-day duration was noninferior to 7 days, with regard to need for antibiotic re-treatment. However, disease severity, treatment setting, prior antibiotics received, and acceptability of the noninferiority margin require consideration when interpreting the findings.

Outcomes were measured during the 14 days following the end of the dispensed antibiotic course. Results: The most commonly prescribed duration of antibiotics was 10 days (82.8% of prescriptions), and 10.5% of patients received short-duration therapy. During the follow-up period, 0.2% of patients were hospitalized, 6.2% filled a new antibiotic prescription, and 5.1% had an acute care visit.

While previous reviews, including the most recent review by Lodha et al, have focused either on single modality of antibiotic therapy (such as choice of antibiotic) or children under the age of 16 years, the current review updates evidence on the choice of drug, duration, route and combination of antibiotics in children specifically between 2 and 59 months of age. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that assessed the route, dose, combination and duration of antibiotics in the management of WHO-defined very severe/severe/non-severe CAP. Study participants included children between 2 and 59 months of age with CAP. All available titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion by two review authors independently. All data was entered and analysed using Review Manager 5 software. The review identified 8122 studies on initial search, of which 22 studies which enrolled 20,593 children were included in meta-analyses. Evidence from these trials showed a combination of penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin to be effective for managing very severe pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age, and oral amoxicillin to be equally efficacious, as other parenteral antibiotics for managing severe pneumonia in children of this particular age group. Oral amoxicillin was also found to be effective in non-severe pneumonia as well. The review further found a short 3 day course of antibiotics to be equally beneficial as 5 day course for managing non-severe pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age. This review updates evidence on the general spectrum of antibiotic recommendation for CAP in children between 2 and 59 months of age, which is an age group that warrants special focus owing to its high disease and mortality burden. Evidence derived from the review found oral amoxicillin to be equally effective as parenteral antibiotics for severe pneumonia in the 2-59 month age group, which holds important implications for LMICs where parenteral drug administration is an issue. Also, the review's finding that 3 day course of antibiotic is equally effective as 5 day course for non-severe pneumonia for 2-59 months of age is again beneficial for LMICs, as a shorter therapy will be associated with a lower cost. The review addresses some research gaps in antibiotic treatment for CAP as well, and this crucial information is presented with the aim of providing a targeted cure for the middle and low income setting.",0.5476064085960388

We compared clinical and laboratory outcomes of a 3-day or a 5-day to a 10-day treatment in young children with community-acquired alveolar pneumonia. Methods: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 2 stages: (1) 3 days versus 10 days and (2) 5 days versus 10 days. Amoxicillin (80 mg/kg/d; divided into 3 daily doses) was used for all arms. Case definition was: age 6-59 months; radiologically confirmed community-acquired alveolar pneumonia; temperature ≥38.5°C; peripheral white blood cell count ≥15,000/mm³; status permitting outpatient treatment. Scheduled visits were on days 4-5 and 10-14 with daily telephone interviews for 30 days. Treatment failure was defined by the need for a rescue treatment or hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were: duration of fever and symptoms and white blood cell and C-reactive protein responses. Results: During Stage 1, 4/10 (40%) and 0/12 (0%) evaluable patients failed in the 3-day and 10-day arms, respectively (P = 0.16). Therefore, the 3-day arm was replaced by a 5-day arm (Stage 2). No failures occurred in the 5-day (n = 56) and 10-day (n = 59) arms. Overall, 4/10 (0%), 0/56 and 0/42 (0%) children failed in the 3-day, 5-day and 10-day arms, respectively (P 0.001, 3-day versus 5-day or 10-day). Secondary outcomes were similar in the 5-day and 10-day arms. Conclusion: In 6- to 59-month-old outpatients with community-acquired alveolar pneumonia, a 5-day course with high-dose oral amoxicillin was not inferior to a 10-day course. The 3-day regimen may be associated with an unacceptable failure rate.",0.1120554506778717

Antimicrobial resistance due to the inappropriate use poses a threat worldwide. Our objective is to analyze and optimize the trends of antibiotics used for pediatric inpatients with CAP in a claims database provided by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Methods: Our database randomly sampled 10% of the hospitalized patients every October from 2011 to 2014. Patients aged 15 years in whom antibiotic therapy was initiated within two days of admission were listed. Subsequently, we investigated the antibiotics administered on the first day of prescription. Results: A total of 4,831 antibiotics were prescribed for 3,909 patients. Many patients aged ≤ five years were treated with β-lactams alone whereas many patients aged ≥ six years were treated with a single antibiotic, such as a macrolide, tetracycline, and quinolone, which covers atypical bacteria. Combination therapy was primarily used in children aged ≥ six years (nearly 30%); the main combination was a β-lactam and non-β-lactam covering atypical bacteria. Ampicillin-sulbactam was the most frequently prescribed β-lactam in children of all ages other than infants. Ampicillin, however, was most often prescribed in infants, but its usage rate was low at other ages. Conclusions: Antibiotics were appropriately prescribed and were similar to that recommended in the 2011 guidelines for pediatric inpatients with CAP. However, combination therapy was frequently prescribed in children aged ≥ six years. According to the revised guidelines in 2017, ampicillin should be used more frequently for patients hospitalized with CAP.",0.4289955794811249

Data collection and analysis: Both original authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. For the 2012 update two authors determined trial eligibility, extracted data, analysed data and updated the contents of the review. Main results: Four trials with a total of 1543 participants were included in the review; we assessed all the included studies as having a low risk of bias. Three trials (1143 participants) included patients with a primary complaint of tinnitus and one (400 participants) included patients with mild to moderate dementia, some of whom had tinnitus.There was no evidence that Gingko biloba was effective in patients with a primary complaint of tinnitus. In the study of patients with dementia, mean baseline levels of tinnitus were low (1.7 to 2.5 on a 10-point subjective symptom rating scale). A small but statistically significant reduction of 1.5 and 0.7 points was seen in patients taking Gingko biloba with vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease respectively.

One of the known mechanisms in the tinnitus area with unknown reason is oxidative events. Based on the prevalence and economic costs and physical- psychological side effects caused by tinnitus and the importance of finding a suitable solution for its prevention and treatment, the need for further studies becomes more obvious in this context. This review article aimed to review studies on the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba as a medicinal plant on patients with tinnitus. Evidence acquisitions: Google Scholar, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), PubMed, LISTA (EBSCO) and Web of Science have been searched. Results: There are many studies on the therapeutic effect of Ginkgo biloba on patients with tinnitus. Most findings are in contrast with each other so that some of studies reported that Ginkgo biloba is effective in the treatment of tinnitus and other studies referred to it as ineffective herbal medicine. Generally, according to the previous studies and the present study, it can mention that the Ginkgo biloba may somewhat improve tinnitus. Conclusion: Since tinnitus is multifactorial, it is recommended to evaluate patients individually based on the cause of tinnitus, treatment formulas, and different doses of Ginkgo biloba at the more extensive level in future studies.",0.6897606253623962

It has been the subject of a great number of studies, especially considering its consequences on patient's quality of life. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of hearing aids and/or Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 on tinnitus in patients with hearing loss. Methods: This is a trial randomized-controlled treatment, parallel, double-blind, with three-arm. Thirty-three adults subjects were divided into three groups: group 1 - subjects undergoing drug therapy with Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761; group 2 - individuals fitted with digital hearing aids; group 3 - individuals submitted to drug therapy with Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 and using hearing aids. The tinnitus handicap inventory and visual analogue scale were used to evaluate self-perception of tinnitus loudness and severity before treatment and 90 days after treatment. Results: This study demonstrated a significant correlation between tinnitus handicap inventory and visual analogue scale, before and after treatment. We observed a significant improvement in self-perception of tinnitus loudness and severity after 90 days of treatment with Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 and/or hearing aids. No correlation was found between tinnitus onset time and self-perception of tinnitus loudness and severity. Hearing aids were more effective in patients with a shorter tinnitus onset time and Ginkgo biloba extract was effective regardless of tinnitus duration.

33,2019,24559809,Does hypnotherapy help people quit smoking?,hypnotherapy quit smoking,0.0,"Background: The efficacy of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is well documented. However, due to relapse rates and side effects, hypnotherapy is gaining attention as an alternative treatment option. The aim of this one-center randomized study was to compare the efficacy of hypnotherapy alone, as well as hypnotherapy with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), to conventional NRT in patients hospitalized with a cardiac or pulmonary illness. Methods: We evaluated self-reported and biochemically verified 7-day prevalence smoking abstinence rates at 12 and 26 weeks post-hospitalization. Patients (n=164) were randomized into one of three counseling-based treatment groups: NRT for 30 days (NRT; n=41), a 90-min hypnotherapy session (H; n=39), and NRT with hypnotherapy (HNRT; n=37). Treatment groups were compared to a ""self-quit"" group of 35 patients who refused intervention. Results: Hypnotherapy patients were more likely than NRT patients to be nonsmokers at 12 weeks (43.9% vs. 28.2%; p=0.14) and 26 weeks after hospitalization (36.6% vs. 18.0%; p=0.06). Smoking abstinence rates in the HNRT group were similar to the H group. There was no difference in smoking abstinence rates at 26 weeks between ""self quit"" and participants in any of the treatment groups. In multivariable regression analysis adjusting for diagnosis and demographic characteristics, H and HNRT were over three times more likely than NRT participants to abstain at 26-weeks post-discharge (RR=3.6; p=0.03 and RR=3.2; p=0.04, respectively). Conclusion: Hypnotherapy is more effective than NRT in improving smoking abstinence in patients hospitalized for a smoking-related illness, and could be an asset to post-discharge smoking cessation programs.",0.29941973090171814
33,2019,31198991,Does hypnotherapy help people quit smoking?,hypnotherapy quit smoking,0.0,"Background: Hypnotherapy is widely promoted as a method for aiding smoking cessation. It is intended to act on underlying impulses to weaken the desire to smoke, or strengthen the will to stop. Objectives: To evaluate the effect and safety of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation. Search methods: For this update we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, and trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), using the terms ""smoking cessation"" and ""hypnotherapy"" or ""hypnosis"", with no restrictions on language or publication date. The most recent search was performed on 18 July 2018. Selection criteria: We considered randomized controlled trials that recruited people who smoked and implemented a hypnotherapy intervention for smoking cessation compared with no treatment, or with any other therapeutic interventions. Trials were required to report smoking cessation rates at least six months after the beginning of treatment. Study eligibility was determined by at least two review authors, independently. Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors independently extracted data on participant characteristics, the type and duration of hypnotherapy, the nature of the control group, smoking status, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. These authors also independently assessed the quality of the included studies. In undertaking this work, we used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months' follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated abstinence rates where available. Those lost to follow-up were considered to still be smoking. We summarized effects as risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. We also noted any adverse events reported. Main results: We included three new trials in this update, which brings the total to 14 included studies that compared hypnotherapy with 22 different control interventions. The studies included a total of 1926 participants. Studies were diverse and a single meta-analysis was not possible. We judged only one study to be at low risk of bias overall; we judged 10 studies to be at high risk of bias and three at unclear risk. Studies did not provide reliable evidence of a greater benefit from hypnotherapy compared with other interventions or no treatment for smoking cessation. Most individual studies did not find statistically significant differences in quit rates after six months or longer, and studies that did detect differences typically had methodological limitations.Pooling small groups of relatively comparable studies did not provide reliable evidence for a specific effect of hypnotherapy relative to controls. There was low certainty evidence, limited by imprecision and risk of bias, that showed no statistically significant difference between hypnotherapy and attention-matched behavioural treatments (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.61; I<sup>2</sup> = 36%; 6 studies, 957 participants). Results were similarly imprecise, and also limited by risk of bias, when comparing hypnotherapy to intensive behavioural interventions (not matched for contact time) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.82; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 211 participants; very low certainty evidence). Results from one small study (40 participants) detected a statistically significant benefit of hypnotherapy compared to no intervention (RR 19.00, 95% CI 1.18 to 305.88), but this evidence was judged to be of very low certainty due to high risk of bias and imprecision. No significant differences were detected in comparisons of hypnotherapy with brief behavioural interventions (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.69; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 269 participants), rapid/focused smoking (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.33; I<sup>2</sup> = 65%; 2 studies, 54 participants), and pharmacotherapies (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.20; I<sup>2</sup> = 5%; 2 studies, 197 participants). When hypnotherapy was evaluated as an adjunct to other treatments, the pooled result from five studies showed a statistically significant benefit in favour of hypnotherapy (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.35; I² = 62%; 224 participants); however, this result should be interpreted with caution due to the high risk of bias across studies (four had a high risk or bias, one had an unclear risk), and substantial statistical heterogeneity.Most studies did not provide information on whether data specifically relating to adverse events were collected, and whether or not any adverse events occurred. One study that did collect such data did not find a statistically significant difference in the adverse event 'index' between hypnotherapy and relaxation. Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to determine whether hypnotherapy is more effective for smoking cessation than other forms of behavioural support or unassisted quitting. If a benefit is present, current evidence suggests the benefit is small at most. There is very little evidence on whether hypnotherapy causes adverse effects, but the existing data show no evidence that it does. Further large, high-quality randomized controlled trials, and more comprehensive assessments of safety, are needed on this topic.",0.18550623953342438

A total of 286 current smokers were enrolled in a randomized controlled smoking cessation trial at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Participants in both treatment conditions were seen for two 60-min sessions, and received three follow-up phone calls and 2 months of NP. At 6 months, 29% of the hypnosis group reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence compared with 23% of the behavioral counseling group (relative risk [RR] = 1.27; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.84-1.92). Based on biochemical or proxy confirmation, 26% of the participants in the hypnosis group were abstinent at 6 months compared with 18% of the behavioral group (RR = 1.44; 95% CI 0.91-2.30). At 12 months, the self-reported 7-day point-prevalence quit rate was 24% for the hypnosis group and 16% for the behavioral group (RR = 1.47; 95% CI 0.90-2.40). Based on biochemical or proxy confirmation, 20% of the participants in the hypnosis group were abstinent at 12 months compared with 14% of the behavioral group (RR = 1.40; 95% CI 0.81-2.42).

It is proposed to act on underlying impulses to weaken the desire to smoke or strengthen the will to stop. Objectives: The objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register. Selection criteria: We considered randomised trials of hypnotherapy which reported smoking cessation rates at least six months after the beginning of treatment. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers extracted data on the type of subjects, the type and duration of the hypnotherapy, the nature of the control group,the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. Subjects lost to follow-up were counted as smokers. Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model. Main results: Nine studies compared hypnotherapy with 14 different control interventions. There was significant heterogeneity between the results of the individual studies, with conflicting results for the effectiveness of hypnotherapy compared to no treatment or to advice. We therefore did not attempt to calculate pooled odds ratios for the overall effect of hypnotherapy. There was no evidence of an effect of hypnotherapy compared to rapid smoking or psychological treatment. Reviewer's conclusions: We have not shown that hypnotherapy has a greater effect on six month quit rates than other interventions or no treatment. The effects of hypnotherapy on smoking cessation claimed by uncontrolled studies were not confirmed by analysis of randomised controlled trials.",0.16130061447620392
33,2019,22475087,Does hypnotherapy help people quit smoking?,hypnotherapy quit smoking,0.0,"Background: A significant number of smokers would like to stop smoking. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of pharmacological smoking cessation treatments, many smokers are unwilling to use them; however, they are inclined to try alternative methods. Hypnosis has a long-standing reputation in smoking cessation therapy, but its efficacy has not been scientifically proven. We designed this randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of group hypnosis as a method for smoking cessation, and we will compare the results of group hypnosis with group relaxation. Methods/design: This is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy of a single session of hypnosis with that of relaxation performed in groups of 8-15 smokers. We intend to include at least 220 participants in our trial. The inclusion criteria include smoking at least 5 cigarettes per day, not using other cessation methods and being willing to quit smoking. The intervention is performed by a trained hypnotist/relaxation therapist. Both groups first receive 40 min of mental preparation that is based on motivational interviewing. Then, a state of deep relaxation is induced in the hypnosis condition, and superficial relaxation is induced in the control condition. Suggestions are made in the hypnosis condition that aim to switch the mental self-image of the participants from that of smokers to that of non-smokers. Each intervention lasts for 40 min. The participants also complete questionnaires that assess their smoking status and symptoms of depression and anxiety at baseline, 2 weeks and 6 months post-intervention. In addition, saliva samples are collected to assess cotinine levels at baseline and at 6 months post-intervention. We also assess nicotine withdrawal symptoms at 2 weeks post-intervention. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, this RCT is the first to test the efficacy of group hypnosis versus group relaxation. Issues requiring discussion in the outcome paper include the lack of standardisation of hypnotic interventions in smoking cessation, the debriefing of the participants, the effects of group dynamics and the reasons for dropouts.

We aimed to investigate the efficacy of a single-session of group hypnotherapy for smoking cessation compared to relaxation in Swiss adult smokers. Methods: This was a cluster-randomised, parallel-group, controlled trial. A single session of hypnosis or relaxation for smoking cessation was delivered to groups of smokers (median size = 11). Participants were 223 smokers consuming ≥ 5 cigarettes per day, willing to quit and not using cessation aids (47.1% females, M = 37.5 years [SD = 11.8], 86.1% Swiss). Nicotine withdrawal, smoking abstinence self-efficacy, and adverse reactions were assessed at a 2-week follow-up. The main outcome, self-reported 30-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence, was assessed at a 6-month follow up. Abstinence was validated through salivary analysis. Secondary outcomes included number of cigarettes smoked per day, smoking abstinence self-efficacy, and nicotine withdrawal. Results: At the 6-month follow up, 14.7% in the hypnosis group and 17.8% in the relaxation group were abstinent. The intervention had no effect on smoking status (p = .73) or on the number of cigarettes smoked per day (p = .56). Smoking abstinence self-efficacy did not differ between the interventions (p = .14) at the 2-week follow-up, but non-smokers in the hypnosis group experienced reduced withdrawal (p = .02). Both interventions produced few adverse reactions (p = .81). Conclusions: A single session of group hypnotherapy does not appear to be more effective for smoking cessation than a group relaxation session.

Methods: This prospective, randomized study included 40 female patients diagnosed with SUI. Patients were randomly divided into two groups as the group receiving pelvic floor muscle exercise (PFME) with a vaginal cone at home (n = 20) and the group receiving PFME with EMG biofeedback in the hospital (n = 20). The measurement of urinary incontinence severity with a 1-h pad test, assessment of social activity with the social activity index (SAI), assessment of incontinence-specific quality of life, manual measurement of pelvic floor muscle strength, and the assessment of treatment satisfaction were performed in the pre-treatment period and post-treatment at 3 and 6 months. Results: In intragroup analyses, an improvement was observed in both groups in the pad test, muscle strength, SAI, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction measurement compared with the pre-treatment period (p 0.05).

Our review confirms that pelvic floor muscle exercise is particularly beneficial in the treatment of urinary stress incontinence in females. Studies have shown up to 70% improvement in symptoms of stress incontinence following appropriately performed pelvic floor exercise. This improvement is evident across all age groups. There is evidence that women perform better with exercise regimes supervised by specialist physiotherapists or continence nurses, as opposed to unsupervised or leaflet-based care. There is evidence for the widespread recommendation that pelvic floor muscle exercise helps women with all types of urinary incontinence.

Aim: To evaluate the predictors of sexual function improvement after participating in three physical therapy sessions and performing home-based pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFME) for the treatment of female UI. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized trial with a 3-month follow-up in which the sexual function of 54 women with UI was evaluated. These women joined three supervised physiotherapy sessions that included PFME and health education during 1 month, with a 15-day interval between each session, and kept practicing home-based PFME for a further 2 months. Main outcome measure: Sexual function was assessed using the Female Sexual Quotient, the pelvic floor muscle strength was measured using the modified Oxford scale, and UI was assessed using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire. Results: The mean of sexual quotient score improved after treatment (P = 0.001). With respect to specific domains of sexual function, improvement was observed only in the questions about sexual desire, arousal/excitement, and orgasm. Before treatment, 18 women (33.3%) were classified as having sexual dysfunction, and after treatment, eight remained with sexual dysfunction and two other joined this category (total of 18.5%). Those women who had sexual dysfunction at baseline experienced a higher level of improvement of the sexual quotient compared with those without sexual dysfunction (P = 0.001, 95% CI = 9.1-31.9). A multivariate linear regression with backward elimination revealed the following predictors of improvement of the sexual quotient: higher parity, higher adherence to PFME, improvement in the strength of PFM, and a decrease in the frequency of urine leakage (R(2) = 0.497). Conclusion: PFME was more beneficial with regard to sexual function in those women who presented with sexual dysfunction at baseline.",0.5296334624290466

The other aim aim was to compare changes in voiding diaries and scores on quality of life questionnaire against baseline values and between the groups. Women in the BF group (n = 18) participated in pelvic floor muscle training with sEMG biofeedback; the P group (n = 13) participated in basic level Pilates workouts. Both protocols were continued for eight weeks. Voiding diary, quality of life and electromyographic characteristics of the pelvic floor muscles were assessed at the three-time points: at baseline, after eight weeks' training, and at month six post-training. The sEMG activity of the pelvic floor muscles was tested during five trials in two positions. There was no marked improvement in bioelectrical activity of the pelvic floor muscles during contraction following training with sEMG biofeedback or Pilates exercises. Following eight weeks of sEMG biofeedback training, a decrease was noted in resting bioelectrical activity of pelvic floor muscles and during relaxation after sustained contraction but only in supine-lying. No such effect was observed in the Pilates group. In the BF group, the number of incontinence episodes after end of treatment (timpepoints: 1vs. 2) and at six month follow-up (timpepoints: 1vs. 3) decreased by 68.5% and 89.3%, respectively. The respective values in the P group were 78.6%, and 86.4%. The intergroup differences did not reach the level of statistical significance. As regards the quality of life, the questionnaire demonstrated that Pilates exercises had significantly better effects compared to biofeedback training both at the end of the eight-week exercise program and (p = 0.003) and at six month follow-up (p = 0.0009). The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ- SF) showed comparable efficacy of Pilates exercises and training with sEMG biofeedback. Intragroup improvements in micturition frequency, incontinence (leakage) episodes, and nocturia frequency were comparable.

36,2019,18310731,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,"Background: Concern about inadvertently sealing over caries often prevents dentists from providing dental sealants. The objective of the authors' review was to examine the effects of sealants on bacteria levels within caries lesions under dental sealants. Methods: The authors searched electronic databases for comparative studies examining bacteria levels in sealed permanent teeth. To measure the effect of sealants on bacteria levels, they used the log(10) reduction in mean total viable bacteria counts (VBC) between sealed and not-sealed caries and the percentage reduction in the proportion of samples with viable bacteria. Results: Six studies--three randomized controlled trials, two controlled trials and one before-and-after study-were included in the analysis. Although studies varied considerably, there were no findings of significant increases in bacteria under sealants. Sealing caries was associated with a 100-fold reduction in mean total VBC (four studies, 138 samples). Sealants reduced the probability of viable bacteria by about 50.0 percent (four studies, 117 samples). Conclusions: The authors found that sealants reduced bacteria in carious lesions, but that in some studies, low levels of bacteria persisted. These findings do not support reported concerns about poorer outcomes associated with inadvertently sealing caries. Clinical implications: Practitioners should not be reluctant to provide sealants-an intervention proven to be highly effective in preventing caries-because of concerns about inadvertently sealing over caries.",0.1850440949201584
36,2019,28759120,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,"Background: Dental sealants were introduced in the 1960s to help prevent dental caries, mainly in the pits and fissures of occlusal tooth surfaces. Sealants act to prevent bacteria growth that can lead to dental decay. Evidence suggests that fissure sealants are effective in preventing caries in children and adolescents compared to no sealants. Effectiveness may, however, be related to caries incidence level of the population. This is an update of a review published in 2004, 2008 and 2013. Objectives: To compare the effects of different types of fissure sealants in preventing caries in occlusal surfaces of permanent teeth in children and adolescents. Search methods: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 3 August 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 3 August 2016), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 3 August 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials to 3 August 2016. No restrictions were placed on language or date of publication. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sealants with no sealant or a different type of sealant material for preventing caries of occlusal surfaces of premolar or molar teeth in children and adolescents aged up to 20 years. Studies required at least 12 months follow-up. We excluded studies that compared compomers to resins/composites. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We presented outcomes for caries or no caries on occlusal surfaces of permanent molar teeth as odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR). We used mean difference (MD) for mean caries increment. All measures were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model for comparisons where there were more than three trials; otherwise we used the fixed-effect model. We used GRADE methods to assess evidence quality. Main results: We included 38 trials that involved a total of 7924 children; seven trials were new for this update (1693 participants). Fifteen trials evaluated the effects of resin-based sealant versus no sealant (3620 participants in 14 studies plus 575 tooth pairs in one study); three trials with evaluated glass ionomer sealant versus no sealant (905 participants); and 24 trials evaluated one type of sealant versus another (4146 participants). Children were aged from 5 to 16 years. Trials rarely reported background exposure to fluoride of trial participants or baseline caries prevalence. Resin-based sealant versus no sealant: second-, third- and fourth-generation resin-based sealants prevented caries in first permanent molars in children aged 5 to 10 years (at 24 months follow-up: OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.19, 7 trials (5 published in the 1970s; 2 in the 2010s), 1548 children randomised, 1322 children evaluated; moderate-quality evidence). If we were to assume that 16% of the control tooth surfaces were decayed during 24 months of follow-up (160 carious teeth per 1000), then applying a resin-based sealant would reduce the proportion of carious surfaces to 5.2% (95% CI 3.13% to 7.37%). Similarly, assuming that 40% of control tooth surfaces were decayed (400 carious teeth per 1000), then applying a resin-based sealant would reduce the proportion of carious surfaces to 6.25% (95% CI 3.84% to 9.63%). If 70% of control tooth surfaces were decayed, there would be 19% decayed surfaces in the sealant group (95% CI 12.3% to 27.2%). This caries-preventive effect was maintained at longer follow-up but evidence quality and quantity was reduced (e.g. at 48 to 54 months of follow-up: OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.28, 4 trials, 482 children evaluated; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.45, 203 children evaluated). Although studies were generally well conducted, we assessed blinding of outcome assessment for caries at high risk of bias for all trials (blinding of outcome assessment is not possible in sealant studies because outcome assessors can see and identify sealant). Glass ionomer sealant versus no sealant: was evaluated by three studies. Results at 24 months were inconclusive (very low-quality evidence). One sealant versus another sealant: the relative effectiveness of different types of sealants is unknown (very low-quality evidence). We included 24 trials that directly compared two different sealant materials. Comparisons varied in terms of types of sealant assessed, outcome measures chosen and duration of follow-up. Adverse events: only four trials assessed adverse events. No adverse events were reported. Authors' conclusions: Resin-based sealants applied on occlusal surfaces of permanent molars are effective for preventing caries in children and adolescents. Our review found moderate-quality evidence that resin-based sealants reduced caries by between 11% and 51% compared to no sealant, when measured at 24 months. Similar benefit was seen at timepoints up to 48 months; after longer follow-up, the quantity and quality of evidence was reduced. There was insufficient evidence to judge the effectiveness of glass ionomer sealant or the relative effectiveness of different types of sealants. Information on adverse effects was limited but none occurred where this was reported. Further research with long follow-up is needed.",0.34643620252609253

36,2019,16121123,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,"Problem/condition: Dental caries is a common chronic disease that causes pain and disability across all age groups. If left untreated, dental caries can lead to pain and infection, tooth loss, and edentulism (total tooth loss). Dental sealants are effective in preventing dental caries in the occlusal (chewing) and other pitted and fissured surfaces of the teeth. Enamel fluorosis is a hypomineralization of enamel related to fluoride exposure during tooth formation (first 6 years for most permanent teeth). Exposure to fluoride throughout life is effective in preventing dental caries. This is the first CDC Surveillance Summary that addresses these conditions and practices. Reporting period: 1988-1994 and 1999-2002. System description: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is an ongoing survey of representative samples of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population aged &gt;/=2 months in NHANES 1988-1994 and all ages during 1999-2002. The dental component gathered information on persons aged &gt;/=2 years. Results: During 1999-2002, among children aged 2-11 years, 41% had dental caries in their primary teeth. Forty-two percent of children and adolescents aged 6-19 years and approximately 90% of adults had dental caries in their permanent teeth. Among children aged 6-19 years, 32% had received dental sealants. Adults aged &gt;/=20 years retained a mean of 24 of 28 natural teeth and 8% were edentulous. Among persons aged 6-39 years, 23% had very mild or greater enamel fluorosis. Disparities were noticed across all age groups, among racial/ethnic groups, persons with lower education and income, and by smoking status. From 1988-1994 to 1999-2002, four trends were observed: 1) no change in the prevalence of dental caries in primary teeth among children aged 2-11 years, 2) a reduction in prevalence of caries in permanent teeth of up to 10 percentage points among persons aged 6-19 years and up to six percentage points among dentate adults aged &gt;/=20 years, 3) an increase of 13 percentage points in dental sealants among persons aged 6-19 years, and 4) a six percentage point reduction in total tooth loss (edentulism) among persons aged &gt;/=60 years. Interpretation: The findings of this report indicate that the dental caries status of permanent teeth has improved since the 1988-1994 survey. Despite the decrease in caries prevalence and severity in the permanent dentition and the increase in the proportion of children and adolescents who benefit from dental sealants, disparities remain. Public health action: These data provide information for public health professionals in designing interventions to improve oral health and to reduce disparities in oral health, for researchers in assessing factors associated with disparities and dental caries in primary teeth, and in designing timely surveillance tools to monitor total fluoride exposure.",0.32656630873680115
36,2019,28876472,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,"Objectives: To systematically review the literature on economic evaluations of dental sealants and examine the costs and effectiveness of caries prevention using sealants. Methods: Of 21 full-text articles examined, a total of 13 were included in this study. These studies are grouped by the type of intervention as follows: (i) sealants compared with no sealants; (ii) sealants compared with other forms of caries prevention; (iii) resin-based sealants compared with glass-ionomer sealants; (iv) different sealing strategies in primary teeth; (v) different sealing strategies in permanent teeth; and (vi) sealants based on school- or clinic-based setting of delivery. All currency is reported in constant 2010 US$. Results: Cost-effectiveness analyses differed due to varying study designs, assumptions, sealant delivery settings, outcomes, caries risk assessment and study durations. Findings varied on the cost-effectiveness of sealants compared with other caries-preventive strategies. Under the assumption of equal caries risk, always sealing primary molars appeared to be the most effective strategy, whereas risk-based sealing was the optimal strategy with differing caries risk. Studies that assessed sealing strategies in permanent teeth reported that risk-based sealing was more cost-effective than not sealing, but they differed on the cost-effectiveness of risk-based seal compared with non-risk-based seal. Sealants delivered in school settings had mixed results on costs but were as equally effective as sealants delivered in private practices. Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness of sealants is dependent on the conditions of delivery. The list of cost-effectiveness ratios for each intervention can support policy makers to estimate expected returns on their investments in dental sealants.",0.5287830233573914

Methods: We assessed the dental experience of the cohort of 15 438 children from 1985 to 1992 on the basis of enrollment and claims files. We conducted regression analyses for outcomes (caries-related services involving the occlusal surface [CRSOs] of permanent first molars) and cumulative expenditures, controlling for characteristics of the child, the treating dentist, and the child's county of residence. Results: Overall, 23% of children received at least 1 sealant and 33% at least 1 CRSO. Sealants were effective in preventing CRSOs, although the degree of effectiveness was highest for children with the greater levels of CRSOs before sealant placement. Estimated cumulative Medicaid expenditures indicated expenditure savings from sealants within 2 years of application for children with 2 or more prior CRSOs. Conclusions: Sealant placement was associated with expenditure savings to Medicaid for certain high-risk children, so Medicaid and, more broadly, society will benefit by providing for sealant placement in these children.",0.3308251202106476

Since some monomers may remain unpolymerized in the application of dental resin, they dissolve in the saliva. (2) Methods: The literature search was carried out in Pubmed, Cochrane and Embase databases. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies and case-control studies that evaluated BPA levels in human urine, saliva and/or blood were included. (3) Results: The initial search had 5111 results. A total of 20 studies were included in the systematic review. Most studies showed an increase of the levels of bisphenol A 1 h after treatments with composite resins and dental sealants. One week after treatments the levels were decreased. (4) Conclusions: Some clinical precautions should be taken to decrease the release of BPA, namely the use of rubber dam, the immediate polishing of all resins used, or the use of glycerin gel to avoid non-polymerization of the last resin layer, and mouthwash after treatment. Another preventive measure in addition to the above-mentioned is the use of the smallest possible number of restorations or sealants, a maximum of four per appointment.

36,2019,32432287,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,"Dental caries in children is a leading worldwide oral health concern. Combining antibacterial and remineralizing additives within dental sealants is a promising approach for caries prevention. Saliva contains oral bacteria that are indicative of the whole oral microbiome and may have the ability to reflect the dysbiosis present in patients with dental caries. Here, we used the saliva of children at a low and high risk of caries to culture microcosm biofilms resembling caries-associated microbial communities and investigated the changes in the biofilms promoted by the formulated dental sealants containing dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM), a quaternary ammonium monomer, and nanoparticles of amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP). Ten volunteers were selected from each caries-risk condition for saliva collection. Biofilms were grown on the tested sealant samples using a 48 h-microcosm biofilm model. The biofilm growth, metabolic behavior, and bacterial acid production were combined with 16S rRNA sequencing analysis for the assessment of the biofilm grown over the material. The DMAHDM-NACP dental sealant formulations promoted a significant reduction in the population of mutans streptococci, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total microorganisms in the biofilms regardless of the risk status of the donor child's saliva (p 0.05). Metabolic and lactic acid production was greatly reduced when in contact with the DMAHDM-NACP sealants in both the sources of inoculum. The relative abundance of the Streptococcus genera derived from patients at a high risk of caries was reduced on contact with the antibacterial sealant. The dental sealant formulations were effective in modulating the growth of the biofilm derived from the saliva of children at a low and high risk of caries. The sealants formulated herein with dual functions and purpose for biointeractivity to prevent biofilm formation and mineral loss can be a reliable complementary strategy to decrease the incidence of carious lesions in children at a high risk of caries.",0.5404894948005676
36,2019,16570469,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,"Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a common component of composites and dental sealants. The potential exists for human exposure after sealant placement. Methods: The authors prospectively enrolled 15 men in an exposure assessment study; 14 completed the study. After placement of clinically appropriate amounts of one of two sealants, the authors measured BPA in saliva and urine samples collected at prescribed intervals after the sealants were placed. They used selective and sensitive isotope-dilution mass-spectrometry-based methods for BPA measurements, thus providing the most reliable results. Results: Helioseal F (Ivoclar Vivadent, Amherst, N.Y.) leached negligible amounts of BPA. Urinary and salivary BPA levels in subjects who received these sealants were similar to baseline levels. Delton Light Cure (LC) Opaque pit-and-fissure sealant (Dentsply/Ash, York, Pa.) leached more BPA, resulting in low-level BPA exposures similar to those used in laboratory animal testing. BPA exposure after Delton LC sealant placement was significantly higher than exposure after placement of Helioseal F. Patients treated with Delton LC had significantly higher doses of BPA (110 microg) than did those treated with Helioseal F (5.5 microg) (P .0001). Conclusions: Placement of clinically relevant amounts of Delton LC sealant resulted in low-level BPA exposure; however, exposure was negligible after placement of Helioseal F. Saliva collection after sealant placement likely reduced systemic absorption of BPA from dental sealants. Sealants should remain a useful part of routine preventive dental practice, especially those that leach negligible amounts of BPA. Clinical implications: Dental sealants may be a point source for low-level BPA exposure at levels that show health effects in rodents. Further research is required to determine whether human exposure to BPA at these levels causes adverse effects.",0.1675025075674057

Although the evidence appears to be inconclusive, narrative reviews and clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of laxatives (and fiber) for the treatment of hemorrhoids and relief of symptoms. This is due to their safety and low cost. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of laxatives on a wide range of symptoms in people with symptomatic hemorrhoids. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1980 to 2005), CINAHL (1982 to 2005), BIOSIS, and AMED (Allied and Alternative Medicine Database), for eligible trials (including conference proceedings). We sought missing and additional information from authors, industry, and experts in the field. Selection criteria: We selected all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials that compared any type of laxative to placebo or no therapy in any patient population. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion and retrieved all potentially relevant studies. Data were extracted from studies that met our selection criteria on study population, intervention used, pre-specified outcomes, and methodology. We extracted methodological information for the assessment of internal validity: existence and method of generation of the randomization schedule, and method of allocation concealment; blinding of caregivers and outcomes assessors; numbers of and reasons for participants lost to follow up; and use of validated outcome measures. Main results: Seven randomised trials enrolling a total of 378 participants to fiber or a non-fiber control were identified. Meta-analyses using random-effects models showed that laxatives in the form of fiber had a beneficial effect in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids. The risk of not improving hemorrhoids and having persisting symptoms decreased by 53% in the fiber group (risk reduction (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.68). These results are compatible with large treatment effects regarding prolapse, pain, itching, although the pooled analyses showed a tendency toward no-effect for these parametres. The effect on bleeding showed a significant difference in favour of the fiber (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89). Studies including data on multiple follow ups (usually after six weeks and three months) showed consistent results over time. However, we have to stress two possible limitations of this review: the risk of publication bias, and only moderate study quality.

We present a short report of these recommendations. Briefly, medical treatment, including dietary fiber, should always be proposed in first intention and instrumental treatment only if medical treatment fails, except in grade ≥III prolapse. Surgery should be the last resort, and the patient well informed of the surgical alternatives, including the possibility of elective ambulatory surgery, if appropriate.

They may co-exist with more serious pathology, and correct evaluation is important. In most cases a one-off colonoscopy in patients aged 50 or above with flexible sigmoidoscopy in younger patients is reasonable. Many people with haemorrhoids do not require treatment. Topical remedies provide no more than symptomatic relief-and even evidence for this is poor. Bulk laxatives alone may improve symptoms of both bleeding and prolapse and seem as effective as injection sclerotherapy. Rubber band ligation is effective in 75% of patients in the short term, but does not treat prolapsed haemorrhoids or those with a significant external component. Conventional haemorrhoidectomy remains the most effective treatment in the long term, the main limitation being post-operative pain. Metronidazole, topical sphincter relaxants and operative technique have all been shown to reduce pain. Stapled haemorrhoidectomy and haemorrhoidal artery ligation techniques are probably less effective but less painful. Long-term data are poor for all procedures, with many studies reporting only 1-3 years of follow-up data. Haemorrhoids are common in pregnancy, occurring in 40% of women. They can usually be treated conservatively during pregnancy, with any treatment delayed until after delivery. Acutely strangulated haemorrhoids may be treated either conservatively or operatively. There is an increased risk of anal stenosis after acute surgery, but the risks of sepsis and sphincter damage are less significant than previously thought.

Abnormal electroneuromyographs were found in four patients. In two additional patients with normal electromyographs, the spinal evoked potentials were asymmetrically slowed suggesting chronic lumbar root compromise. The onset of lumbar radiculopathy after intermittent cervical traction suggests that axial tension induced in the spinal cord's dural coverings can be transmitted to lumbar nerve roots.

38,2019,30961554,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,"Background: Lumbar traction is a traditional treatment modality for chronic low back pain (CLBP) in many countries. However, its effectiveness has not been demonstrated in clinical practice because of the following: (1) the lack of in vivo biomechanical confirmation of the mechanism of lumbar traction that occurs at the lumbar spine; (2) the lack of a precise delivery system for traction force and, subsequently, the lack of reproducibility; and (3) few randomized controlled trials proving its effectiveness and utility. Methods: This study was planned as a preparatory experiment for a randomized clinical trial, and it aimed (1) to examine the biomechanical change at the lumbar area under lumbar traction and confirm its reproducibility and accuracy as a mechanical intervention, and (2) to reconfirm our clinical impression of the immediate effect of lumbar traction. One hundred thirty-three patients with non-specific CLBP were recruited from 28 orthopaedic clinics to undergo a biomechanical experiment and to assess and determine traction conditions for the next clinical trial. We used two types of traction devices, which are commercially available, and incorporated other measuring tools, such as an infrared range-finder and large extension strain gauge. The finite element method was used to analyze the real data of pelvic girdle movement at the lumbar spine level. Self-report assessments with representative two conditions were analyzed according to the qualitative coding method. Results: Thirty-eight participants provided available biomechanical data. We could not measure directly what happened in the body, but we confirmed that the distraction force lineally correlated with the movement of traction unit at the pelvic girdle. After applying vibration force to preloading, the strain gauge showed proportional vibration of the shifting distance without a phase lag qualitatively. FEM simulation provided at least 3.0-mm shifting distance at the lumbar spine under 100 mm of body traction. Ninety-five participants provided a treatment diary and were classified as no pain, improved, unchanged, and worsened. Approximately 83.2% of participants reported a positive response. Conclusion: Lumbar traction can provide a distractive force at the lumbar spine, and patients who experience the application of such force show an immediate response after traction.

The aim of this study was to examine its efficacy in this disorder. Forty-two patients with at least 6 weeks of nonspecific LBP were selected. Demographic data were obtained. All patients completed the Oswestry disability index (ODI) to assess disability and the 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) for evaluation of pain. Subjects were randomly assigned into group 1, receiving only standard physical therapy, or group 2, receiving standard physical therapy with conventional lumbar traction. Standard physical therapy consisted of local heat, ultrasound for the lumbar region, and an active exercise program, given for ten sessions in all. The subjects received instruction on correct posture and recommended therapeutic exercises. They were reevaluated at the end of treatment and at 3-month follow-up. The mean outcome measures were global improvement and satisfaction with the therapy, as well as disability by ODI and pain by VAS. There were no group differences in terms of demographic and baseline clinical characteristics. There was a significant reduction in pain intensity and disability at the end of treatment in both groups. There was complete or mild improvement in 47.6% of group 1 and 40% of group 2.

The aim of this study will be to examine the effectiveness of treatment that includes traction for patients with low back pain and signs of nerve root irritation, and within the pre-defined sub-group. Methods/design: The study will recruit 120 patients with low back pain and signs of nerve root irritation. Patients will be randomized to receive an extension-oriented treatment approach, with or without the addition of mechanical traction. Randomization will be stratified based on the presence of the pre-defined sub-grouping criteria. All patients will receive 12 physical therapy treatment sessions over 6 weeks. Follow-up assessments will occur after 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. The primary outcome will be disability measured with a modified Oswestry questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will include self-reports of low back and leg pain intensity, quality of life, global rating of improvement, additional healthcare utilization, and work absence.

The efficacy of traction is also unclear because of generally poor design of the clinical trials to date, and because subgroups of patients most likely to benefit have not been specifically studied. These observations prompted this review, the purposes of which are to evaluate the mechanisms by which traction may provide benefit and to provide rational guidelines for the clinical application of traction. Traction has been shown to separate the vertebrae and it appears that large forces are not required. Vertebral separation could provide relief from radicular symptoms by removing direct pressure or contact forces from sensitised neural tissue. Other mechanisms proposed to explain the effects of traction (e.g. reduction of disc protrusion or altered intradiscal pressure) have been shown not to occur. We conclude that traction is most likely to benefit patients with acute (less than 6 weeks' duration) radicular pain with concomitant neurological deficit. The apparent lack of a dose-response relationship suggests that low doses are probably sufficient to achieve benefit.",0.11542125046253204
38,2019,24964511,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,"Pain of the lower back is one of the most common ailments in modem society. Such frequent occurrence of back pain syndromes is a serious medical and social problem. Despite numerous attempts, there have not been comprehensive or decisive publications on the therapeutic standard for back pain syndromes that would cover all the aspects of the ailment. Partial report can change the attitude and shed new light on the treatment of these syndromes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of Saunders lumbar tractions in patients with chronic lower back pain in comparison with the group of patients undergoing pharmacological treatment. Material and methods: The study included 140 patients with chronic lower back pain who were divided into two groups. Each group consisted of 70 persons of mixed gender (the age mean value was 45). Group I were treated with the use of Saunders lumbar traction and Group II (control group) were treated pharmacologically. The following scales were used to assess pain and mobility of the lumbar part of the vertebral column (before treatment, in-treatment, right after treatment and 30 days after treatment): Laitinen, VAS, Rolland-Morris questionnaire and Schober functional test. The statistical analysis was performed with Greenhouse-Geisser test of within-subjects effects. Results: In both the groups, a significant analgesic action and an improvement to spinal mobility were observed. Significantly better results were obtained in Group I where the patients had been treated with the use of Saunders lumbar traction. Conclusions: The pharmacological treatment applied in Group II showed an analgesic action and influenced positively the functional parameters of the patients. The effects, however, were much worse than in Group 1 where axial Saunders traction was applied to the lumbar part of the vertebral column.",0.49490609765052795
38,2019,26813755,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,"Study design: Randomized clinical trial. Background The recommended initial management strategy for patients with low back pain and signs of nerve root compression is conservative treatment, but there is little evidence to guide the most appropriate management strategy. Preliminary research suggests that a treatment protocol of mechanical traction and extension-oriented exercises may be effective, particularly in a specific subgroup of patients. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of mechanical traction in patients with lumbar nerve root compression and within a predefined subgroup. Methods: One hundred twenty patients with low back pain with nerve root compression were recruited from physical therapy clinics. Using predefined subgrouping criteria, patients were stratified at baseline and randomized to receive an extension-oriented treatment approach with or without the addition of mechanical traction. During a 6-week period, patients received up to 12 treatment visits. Primary outcomes of pain and disability were collected at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year by assessors blinded to group allocation. Outcomes were examined using linear mixed-model analyses examining change over time by treatment and the interaction between treatment and subgrouping status. Results: The mean ± SD age of participants was 41.1 ± 11.3 years, median duration of symptoms was 62 days, and 57% were male. No significant differences in disability or pain outcomes were noted between treatment groups at any time point, nor was any interaction found between subgroup status and treatment. Conclusion: Patients with lumbar nerve root compression presenting for physical therapy can expect significant changes in disability and pain over a 6-week treatment period. There is no evidence that mechanical lumbar traction in combination with an extension-oriented treatment is superior to extension-oriented exercises alone in the management of these patients or within a predefined subgroup of patients.

Objective: To determine if traction is more effective than reference treatments, placebo/sham traction, or no treatment for low back pain (LBP). Summary of background data: Various types of traction are used in the treatment of LBP, often in conjunction with other treatments. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to November 2004, and screened the latest issue of the Cochrane Library (2004, issue 4) and references in relevant reviews and our personal files. We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving any type of traction for the treatment of acute (less than 4 weeks duration), subacute (4-12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks) nonspecific LBP with or without sciatica. Sets of 2 reviewers independently performed study selection, methodological quality assessment, and data extraction. Because available studies did not provide sufficient data for statistical pooling, we performed a qualitative ""levels of evidence"" analysis, systematically estimating the strength of the cumulative evidence on the difference/lack of difference observed in trial outcomes. Results: A total of 24 RCTs (2177 patients) were included. There were 5 trials considered high quality. For mixed groups of patients with LBP with and without sciatica, we found: (1) strong evidence that there is no statistically significant difference in short or long-term outcomes between traction as a single treatment, (continuous or intermittent) and placebo, sham, or no treatment; (2) moderate evidence that traction as a single treatment is no more effective than other treatments; and (3) limited evidence that adding traction to a standard physiotherapy program does not result in significantly different outcomes. For LBP with sciatica, we found conflicting evidence in several of the comparisons: autotraction compared to placebo, sham, or no treatment; other forms of traction compared to other treatments; and different forms of traction. In the remaining comparisons, there were no statistically significant differences; level of evidence is moderate regarding continuous or intermittent traction compared to placebo, sham, or no treatment, and is limited regarding different forms of traction. Conclusion: Based on the current evidence, intermittent or continuous traction as a single treatment for LBP cannot be recommended for mixed groups of patients with LBP with and without sciatica. Neither can traction be recommended for patients with sciatica because of inconsistent results and methodological problems in most of the studies involved. However, because high-quality studies within the field are scarce, because many are underpowered, and because traction often is supplied in combination with other treatment modalities, the literature allows no firm negative conclusion that traction, in a generalized sense, is not an effective treatment for patients with LBP.",0.14406195282936096

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Data sources: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, clinicialtrialsregister.eu, and WHO ICTRP from inception to 23 February 2021. Eligibility criteria for study selection: Randomised controlled trials of muscle relaxants compared with placebo, usual care, waiting list, or no treatment in adults (≥18 years) reporting non-specific low back pain. Data extraction and synthesis: Two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and certainty of the evidence using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations, respectively. Random effects meta-analytical models through restricted maximum likelihood estimation were used to estimate pooled effects and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Outcomes included pain intensity (measured on a 0-100 point scale), disability (0-100 point scale), acceptability (discontinuation of the drug for any reason during treatment), and safety (adverse events, serious adverse events, and number of participants who withdrew from the trial because of an adverse event). Results: 49 trials were included in the review, of which 31, sampling 6505 participants, were quantitatively analysed. For acute low back pain, very low certainty evidence showed that at two weeks or less non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics were associated with a reduction in pain intensity compared with control (mean difference -7.7, 95% confidence interval-12.1 to-3.3) but not a reduction in disability (-3.3, -7.3 to 0.7). Low and very low certainty evidence showed that non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics might increase the risk of an adverse event (relative risk 1.6, 1.2 to 2.0) and might have little to no effect on acceptability (0.8, 0.6 to 1.1) compared with control for acute low back pain, respectively. The number of trials investigating other muscle relaxants and different durations of low back pain were small and the certainty of evidence was reduced because most trials were at high risk of bias. Conclusions: Considerable uncertainty exists about the clinical efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants. Very low and low certainty evidence shows that non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics might provide small but not clinically important reductions in pain intensity at or before two weeks and might increase the risk of an adverse event in acute low back pain, respectively.

This review evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of muscle relaxants in people with LBP. We searched online databases including Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL and PsycINFO (inception to end October 2015) and performed citation tracking for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of randomized controlled trials of muscle relaxants. Pain outcomes were converted to a common 0-100 scale. Data were pooled using a random effects model with strength of evidence assessed using GRADE. Fifteen trials (3362 participants) were evaluated in this review. A total of five trials (496 participants) provide high quality evidence that muscle relaxants provide clinically significant pain relief in the short term for acute LBP; MD -21.3, [-29.0, -13.5]. There was no information on long-term outcomes. The median adverse event rate in clinical trials for muscle relaxants was similar to placebo 14.1% IQR (7.0-28.7%) and 16.0% (4.1-31.2%); p = 0.5, respectively. There is no evidence for the efficacy of benzodiazepines in LBP. For people with acute LBP, muscle relaxants provide clinically significant short-term pain relief. For chronic LBP, the efficacy of muscle relaxants is largely unknown. There was no eligible RCT evidence to support the efficacy of benzodiazepines in LBP.

Investigating appropriate care has proven difficult, since, in general, acute pain subsides spontaneously and chronic pain is resistant to intervention. Subacute back pain has been rarely studied. Objective: To compare the relative efficacy of chiropractic adjustments with muscle relaxants and placebo/sham for subacute low back pain. Design: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Methods: Subjects (N = 192) experiencing low back pain of 2 to 6 weeks' duration were randomly allocated to 3 groups with interventions applied over 2 weeks. Interventions were either chiropractic adjustments with placebo medicine, muscle relaxants with sham adjustments, or placebo medicine with sham adjustments. Visual Analog Scale for Pain, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and Modified Zung Depression Scale were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks. Schober's flexibility test, acetaminophen usage, and Global Impression of Severity Scale (GIS), a physician's clinical impression used as a secondary outcome, were assessed at baseline and 2 weeks. Results: Baseline values, except GIS, were similar for all groups. When all subjects completing the protocol were combined (N = 146), the data revealed pain, disability, depression, and GIS decreased significantly (P .0001); lumbar flexibility did not change. Statistical differences across groups were seen for pain, a primary outcome, (chiropractic group improved more than control group) and GIS (chiropractic group improved more than other groups). No significant differences were seen for disability, depression, flexibility, or acetaminophen usage across groups. Conclusion: Chiropractic was more beneficial than placebo in reducing pain and more beneficial than either placebo or muscle relaxants in reducing GIS.",0.26321375370025635

The indications for use and outcomes are not clear. Methods: We performed a secondary data analysis of a cohort of 1633 patients who sought care from a variety of practitioners (primary care, physician of chiropractic, orthopedic surgeon, Health Maintenance Organization) for low back pain. Patients were enrolled in the physician's office and interviewed at baseline, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. Pain, functional status, medication use, health care utilization, and satisfaction with care were assessed. Results: Muscle relaxants were used by 49% of patients; among those who sought care from doctors, 64% used muscle relaxants. Muscle relaxant users were more impaired at baseline. Over time, among patients with greater functional status impairment (Roland disability score &gt; 12) at baseline, muscle relaxant users had somewhat slower recovery from the episode of back pain.

Low back pain is often associated with muscle spasm. We investigated the combined effect of muscle relaxants and pain killers for low back pain. Methods: In this open-label, prospective, multicenter study, patients with acute low back pain received a single tablet of either the fixed dose combination of chlorzoxazone 500 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg (manufacturer: Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, India) (C + I group) or ibuprofen 400 mg (I group) thrice daily for up to 7 days. Primary outcomes were improvement in pain by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) at 3 and 7 days post-treatment. Results: A total of 406 patients were included in this study. When compared to baseline, the absolute mean change in VAS scores on Day 7 was 62.39 ± 18.78 and 57.34 ± 16.29 in the C + I and I groups, respectively (P = 0.0001). In the C + I and I groups, the mean SPID at Days 3 and 7 were 51.27 ± 24.44 and 47.80 ± 22.91, and 300.82 ± 92.40 and 277.16 ± 81.83, respectively. No deaths or serious adverse events were reported. Common adverse events included gastritis, stomach pain, fever, cold, and headache. At the end of the study, excellent to good response was reported in 94.08% and 77.33% of patients in the C + I and I groups, respectively.

Many treatment options are available, but some lack scientific support. Objective: The aim of this review was to discuss the etiology of low back pain and the relative risks and benefits of muscle relaxants commonly prescribed for the management of back pain. Methods: We searched Intercontinental Marketing Services data for January 2003 through January 2004 to determine the most commonly prescribed agents for the management of musculoskeletal pain. Carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride, and metaxalone represented &gt;45% of all such prescriptions.

Results: Three trials of carisoprodol (N = 197) were located in the Cochrane Library database. Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (N = 1405) were identified in the literature. Three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were identified for metaxalone (N = 428) in 2 reports. The types of adverse events seen with these agents involved the central nervous system, including drowsiness/sedation, fatigue, and dizziness. However, the efficacy of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride was shown to be independent of its sedative effects, which were dose related. The potential for abuse with carisoprodol is of growing concern. Conclusions: Analgesic pain management for low back pain due to muscle spasm may be combined with a muscle relaxant. Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride has the most recent and largest clinical trials demonstrating its benefit, but carisoprodol and metaxalone also appear to be effective. However, carisoprodol's usefulness is mitigated by its potential for abuse.",0.37448814511299133

Improvements in glycaemic control may help to reduce the risk of these complications. Several animal studies show that cinnamon may be effective in improving glycaemic control. While these effects have been explored in humans also, findings from these studies have not yet been systematically reviewed. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of cinnamon in patients with diabetes mellitus. Search methods: Pertinent randomised controlled trials were identified through AARP Ageline, AMED, AMI, BioMed Central gateway, CAM on PubMed, CINAHL, Dissertations Abstracts International, EMBASE, Health Source Nursing/Academic edition, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, Natural medicines comprehensive database, The Cochrane Library and TRIP database. Clinical trial registers and the reference lists of included trials were searched also (all up to January 2012). Content experts and manufacturers of cinnamon extracts were also contacted. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of orally administered monopreparations of cinnamon (Cinnamomum spp.) to placebo, active medication or no treatment in persons with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and trial quality, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing information. Main results: Ten prospective, parallel-group design, randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 577 participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, were identified. Risk of bias was high or unclear in all but two trials, which were assessed as having moderate risk of bias. Risk of bias in some domains was high in 50% of trials. Oral monopreparations of cinnamon (predominantly Cinnamomum cassia) were administered at a mean dose of 2 g daily, for a period ranging from 4 to 16 weeks. The effect of cinnamon on fasting blood glucose level was inconclusive. No statistically significant difference in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum insulin or postprandial glucose was found between cinnamon and control groups. There were insufficient data to pool results for insulin sensitivity. No trials reported health-related quality of life, morbidity, mortality or costs. Adverse reactions to oral cinnamon were infrequent and generally mild in nature. Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cinnamon for type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Further trials, which address the issues of allocation concealment and blinding, are now required.

Patients received cinnamon bark powder or placebo in 500 mg capsules twice daily for 3 months. Anthropometric, glycemic and lipid outcomes were measured before and after the intervention. Result: Cinnamon supplementation led to improvement of all anthropometric (BMI, body fat, and visceral fat), glycemic (FPG, 2hpp, Hb A1C , Fasting Insulin, and Insulin Resistance), and lipids (Cholesterol Total, LDL-c and HDL-c) outcomes (except for triglycerides level). All observed changes (except for Cholesterol Total and LDL-c) were significantly more prominent in patients with higher baseline BMI (BMI ≥ 27). Conclusion: Based on the study findings, cinnamon may improve anthropometric parameters, glycemic indices and lipid profile of patients with type II diabetes. These benefits are significantly more prominent in patients with higher baseline BMI (BMI ≥ 27). The trial protocol was registered in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials database (registration ID: IRCT2017031133015N1).",0.6979761123657227
40,2019,16549460,Can cinnamon help people with diabetes?,cinnamon diabetes,0.0,"In vitro and in vivo animal studies have reported strong insulin-like or insulin-potentiating effects after cinnamon administration. Recently, a human intervention study showed that cinnamon supplementation (1 g/d) strongly reduced fasting blood glucose concentration (30%) and improved the blood lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of cinnamon supplementation on insulin sensitivity and/or glucose tolerance and blood lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, a total of 25 postmenopausal patients with type 2 diabetes (aged 62.9 +/- 1.5 y, BMI 30.4 +/- 0.9 kg/m2) participated in a 6-wk intervention during which they were supplemented with either cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia, 1.5 g/d) or a placebo. Before and after 2 and 6 wk of supplementation, arterialized blood samples were obtained and oral glucose tolerance tests were performed. Blood lipid profiles and multiple indices of whole-body insulin sensitivity were determined. There were no time x treatment interactions for whole-body insulin sensitivity or oral glucose tolerance. The blood lipid profile of fasting subjects did not change after cinnamon supplementation. We conclude that cinnamon supplementation (1.5 g/d) does not improve whole-body insulin sensitivity or oral glucose tolerance and does not modulate blood lipid profile in postmenopausal patients with type 2 diabetes. More research on the proposed health benefits of cinnamon supplementation is warranted before health claims should be made.",0.11047933250665665

This study systematically reviewed and synthesized evidence on the efficacy of cinnamon for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and pre-diabetes patients. Methods: Databases of Web of Sciences, the Cochrane library, PubMed, CINAHL and SCOPUS were searched. Stata version 13 (College Station, Texas 77845 USA) and RevMan var. 5.3 software were used for meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using Chi-square and I<sup>2</sup> tests. Results: Sixteen randomized controlled studies were included in the meta-analysis. Cinnamon significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) level compared to placebo with weighted mean difference (WMD) of -0.545 (95% CI: -0.910, -0.18) mmol/L, I<sup>2</sup> = 83.6% and -0.714(-1.388, -0.04), I<sup>2</sup> = 84.4% respectively. There was no significant change in weighted mean difference of glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) % and lipid profiles (mmol/L). Meta-regression did not show any factor significantly affecting the treatment response. Conclusion: Cinnamon reduced FBG and HOMA-IR, level in T2DM and pre-diabetes patients compared to placebo. High heterogeneity observed among included studies warrants further clinical trials after standardization of cinnamon formulation.",0.6702613830566406

Cinnamon or Dalchini is popularly use as a spice for its fragrance and flavour in wide variety of traditional foods. Among various types of cinnamon, C. zeylanicum is well known as effective substitute for diabetes. Cinnamaldehyde is one of the major constituents (65-80%) of bark oil extracted from C. Zeylonicum which seems to reduce plasma blood glucose concentration more effectively when it is compared with metformin.

However, there are no studies to date that investigate whether cinnamon supplements are able to aid in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Chinese subjects. We hypothesized cinnamon should be effective in improving blood glucose control in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. To address this hypothesis, we performed a randomized, double-blinded clinical study to analyze the effect of cinnamon extract on glycosylated hemoglobin A(1c) and fasting blood glucose levels in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 66 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited and randomly divided into 3 groups: placebo and low-dose and high-dose supplementation with cinnamon extract at 120 and 360 mg/d, respectively. Patients in all 3 groups took gliclazide during the entire 3 months of the study. Both hemoglobin A(1c) and fasting blood glucose levels were significantly reduced in patients in the low- and high-dose groups, whereas they were not changed in the placebo group. The blood triglyceride levels were also significantly reduced in the low-dose group. The blood levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and liver transaminase remained unchanged in the 3 groups.

40,2019,17381386,Can cinnamon help people with diabetes?,cinnamon diabetes,0.0,"Diabetes mellitus is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and most patients with the disease have type 2 diabetes. The effectiveness of cinnamon supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes has received a great deal of media attention after a study was published in 2003. Although the efficacy of cinnamon in patients with diabetes has not been established, many patients seek other therapies and supplement their prescribed pharmacologic therapy with cinnamon. We conducted a literature search, limited to English-language human studies, using MEDLINE (1966-August 2006), EMBASE (1980-August 2006), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-August 2006), and Iowa Drug Information Service (1966-August 2006). References from articles and clinical trials were reviewed for additional sources; no abstracts were reviewed. We found two prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, peer-reviewed clinical trials and one prospective, placebo-controlled, peer-reviewed clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of cinnamon supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes; a total of 164 patients were involved in these trials. Two of the studies reported modest improvements in lowering blood glucose levels with cinnamon supplementation in small patient samples. One trial showed no significant difference between cinnamon and placebo in lowering blood glucose levels. Overall, cinnamon was well tolerated. These data suggest that cinnamon has a possible modest effect in lowering plasma glucose levels in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. However, clinicians are strongly urged to refrain from recommending cinnamon supplementation in place of the proven standard of care, which includes lifestyle modifications, oral antidiabetic agents, and insulin therapy.",0.13780246675014496

A prior meta-analysis did not show significant results, but several RCTs have been published since then. We conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating cinnamon's effect on glycemia and lipid levels. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched through February 2012. Included RCTs evaluated cinnamon compared with control in patients with type 2 diabetes and reported at least one of the following: glycated hemoglobin (A1c), fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or triglycerides. Weighted mean differences (with 95% confidence intervals) for endpoints were calculated using random-effects models. Results: In a meta-analysis of 10 RCTs (n = 543 patients), cinnamon doses of 120 mg/d to 6 g/d for 4 to 18 weeks reduced levels of fasting plasma glucose (-24.59 mg/dL; 95% CI, -40.52 to -8.67 mg/dL), total cholesterol (-15.60 mg/dL; 95% CI, -29.76 to -1.44 mg/dL), LDL-C (-9.42 mg/dL; 95% CI, -17.21 to -1.63 mg/dL), and triglycerides (-29.59 mg/dL; 95% CI, -48.27 to -10.91 mg/dL). Cinnamon also increased levels of HDL-C (1.66 mg/dL; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.24 mg/dL). No significant effect on hemoglobin A1c levels (-0.16%; 95%, CI -0.39% to 0.02%) was seen. High degrees of heterogeneity were present for all analyses except HDL-C (I(2) ranging from 66.5% to 94.72%). Conclusions: The consumption of cinnamon is associated with a statistically significant decrease in levels of fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels, and an increase in HDL-C levels; however, no significant effect on hemoglobin A1c was found. The high degree of heterogeneity may limit the ability to apply these results to patient care, because the preferred dose and duration of therapy are unclear.",0.1954178363084793

In addition to its culinary uses, cinnamon possesses a rising popularity due to many stated health benefits. Out of the large number of cinnamon species available, Cinnamomum aromaticum (Cassia) and Cinnamomum zeylanicum have been subjected to extensive research. Available in vitro and in vivo evidence indicates that cinnamon may have multiple health benefits, mainly in relation to hypoglycaemic activity. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of cinnamon is stated also to be brought about by its anti-microbial, anti-fungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-tumour, blood pressure-lowering, cholesterol and lipid-lowering and gastro-protective properties. This article provides a summary of the scientific literature available on both C. aromaticum and C. zeylanicum. All studies reported here have used cinnamon bark and its products. Although almost all the animal models have indicated a pronounced anti-diabetic activity of both cinnamon species, conflicting results were observed with regard to the few clinical trials available. Therefore, the necessity of evaluating the effects of cinnamon for its therapeutic potential through well-defined and adequately powered randomized controlled clinical trials is emphasized, before recommendations are made for the use of cinnamon as an effective treatment for humans.",0.6044915914535522

Parallel searches on web sites of health technology assessment and related agencies, and their databases. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials examining effectiveness, safety and risk-benefit of benzodiazepines in comparison with placebo or other pharmacological treatment and between themselves. All patients were included regardless of age, gender, nationality, and outpatient or inpatient therapy. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies. Main results: Sixty four studies, 4309 participants, met the inclusion criteria.- Comparing benzodiazepines versus placebo, benzodiazepines performed better for seizures, 3 studies, 324 participants, RR 0.16 (0.04 to 0.69), no statistically significant difference for the other outcomes considered.- Comparing benzodiazepines versus other drugs, there is a trend in favour of benzodiazepines for seizure and delirium control, severe life threatening side effect, dropouts, dropouts due to side effects and patient's global assessment score.

This systematic review focuses on the evidence of benzodiazepines' use in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2004) and EU-PSI PSI-Tri database with no language and publication restrictions. We also screened references of retrieved articles. Selection criteria: All randomized controlled trials examining the effectiveness and safety of a benzodiazepine in comparison with a placebo or other pharmacological intervention or other benzodiazepine were considered. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results: Fifty-seven trials, with a total of 4,051 people were included. Despite the considerable number of randomized controlled trials, there was a very large variety of outcomes and of different rating scales and relatively limited quantitative synthesis of data was feasible. Benzodiazepines offered a large benefit against alcohol withdrawal seizures compared to placebo (relative risk [RR] 0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04 to 0.69; p = 0.01). Benzodiazepines had similar success rates as other drugs (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12) or anticonvulsants in particular (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16) and offered a significant benefit for seizure control against non-anticonvulsants (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.75; p = 0.02), but not against anticonvulsants (RR 1.99; 95% CI 0.46 to 8.65). Changes in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) scores at the end of treatment were similar with benzodiazepines versus other drugs, although some small studies showed isolated significant differences for other, less commonly, used scales. Data on other comparisons were very limited, thus making quantitative synthesis for various outcomes not very informative. Authors' conclusions: Benzodiazepines are effective against alcohol withdrawal symptoms, in particular seizures, when compared to placebo. It is not possible to draw definite conclusions about the relative effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines against other drugs in alcohol withdrawal, because of the large heterogeneity of the trials both in interventions and assessment of outcomes but the available data do not show prominent differences between benzodiazepines and other drugs in success rates.",0.2019810676574707

This study determines the benefits of an individualized treatment regimen on the quantity of benzodiazepine administered and the duration of its use during alcohol withdrawal treatment. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial including 117 consecutive patients with alcohol dependence, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, entering an alcohol treatment program at both the Lausanne and Geneva university hospitals, Switzerland. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: (1) 56 were treated with oxazepam in response to the development of signs of alcohol withdrawal (symptom-triggered); and (2) 61 were treated with oxazepam every 6 hours with additional doses as needed (fixed-schedule). The administration of oxazepam in group 1 and additional oxazepam in group 2 was determined using a standardized measure of alcohol withdrawal. The main outcome measures were the total amount and duration of treatment with oxazepam, the incidence of complications, and the comfort level. Results: A total of 22 patients (39%) in the symptom-triggered group were treated with oxazepam vs 100% in the fixed-schedule group (P .001). The mean oxazepam dose administered in the symptom-triggered group was 37.5 mg compared with 231.4 mg in the fixed-schedule group (P .001). The mean duration of oxazepam treatment was 20.0 hours in the symptom-triggered group vs 62.7 hours in the fixed-schedule group (P .001). Withdrawal complications were limited to a single episode of seizures in the symptom-triggered group. There were no differences in the measures of comfort between the 2 groups.

Benzodiazepine-resistant alcohol withdrawal (RAW) is a subset of severe alcohol withdrawal defined by the requirement of ≥40mg of diazepam administered within one hour. Use of adjunct agents, such as propofol, may be beneficial to minimize BZD adverse effects and improve symptom control. While limited evidence suggests propofol as an effective adjunct in AWS through improved sedation, evidence is currently lacking for the addition of only propofol to BZDs for management of RAW. Methods: Retrospective review of adult patients from January, 2009 to March, 2012 with RAW. Patients were categorized into BZD dose-escalation only or BZD plus propofol. The primary endpoint was time to resolution of AWS. Secondary endpoints included safety outcomes associated with medication use. Results: Of 1083 patients with severe AWS, 66 RAW patients (n=33 BZD only, n=33 BZD plus propofol) met inclusion. Median time to AWS resolution was 5.0 and 7.0 days for BZD only vs. BZD plus propofol (p=0.025). Duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay were significantly higher with propofol (p=0.017, 0.001 and 0.001, respectively). Ten patients required intervention for management of propofol-induced adverse reactions. Conclusions: The addition of propofol for RAW treatment is associated with significant increases in clinical care. While randomized, prospective evaluations are necessary to determine the cause of this association, our data suggests use of adjunctive propofol therapy in RAW is associated with longer and more complicated hospital admissions.",0.3284258246421814

Benzodiazepines are cross-tolerant with ethanol and are considered first-line therapy for treating AWS. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are first metabolized by hepatic oxidation, then glucuronidation. Lorazepam and oxazepam undergo only hepatic glucuronidation. Benzodiazepine oxidation is decreased in persons with liver disease and the elderly. Accumulation with resultant excessive sedation and respiratory depression may be significant when administering chlordiazepoxide or diazepam to patients with impaired oxidative metabolism. Lorazepam and oxazepam metabolism is minimally affected by age and liver disease. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are erratically absorbed by the intramuscular route. Lorazepam is predictably absorbed by the intramuscular route. Oxazepam is not available in parenteral form.

Treatment with BZDs can be administered on an out-patient basis for subjects experiencing mild to moderate withdrawal and on an in-patient basis for the most severe forms of withdrawal. The efficacy of BZDs for long-term treatment of alcoholism has been more controversial. Controlled studies indicate that BZD treatment does not improve abstinence rate. Most reviews of drug treatment of alcoholism conclude that routine use of BZDs is not indicated on a long-term basis. However, the clinical reality is that many alcoholics are treated by BZDs during detoxification and then continue to receive them for the treatment of anxiety disorders or insomnia, often secondary to alcohol dependence. After a review of the biological properties of BZDs related to their therapeutic issues, this review discusses the major indications for BZD treatment of alcoholism. BZDs are first prescribed to prevent and treat symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Indication of BZD administration during alcohol withdrawal and criteria of choice of an agent according to its half-life or its route of administration are discussed. The different protocols of BZD treatment during withdrawal are considered (e.g. loading techniques, symptom-triggered therapy).

Results: From 294 nonduplicative articles, 4 controlled trials and 5 observational studies (n = 720) for AWS of any severity were included. Studies were of good quality (n = 2), fair (n = 4), and poor (n = 3). In 6 studies describing phenobarbital without concomitant benzodiazepine therapy, phenobarbital decreased AWS symptoms ( P .00001) and displayed similar rates of treatment failure versus comparator therapies (38% vs 29%).

These drugs are known for their abuse liability and might increase alcohol consumption among problem drinkers. Phenobarbital could be an alternative treatment option, possibly with the drawback of a more pronounced acute toxicity. We evaluated if phenobarbital compared to chlordiazepoxide decreased the risk of subsequent use of benzodiazepines, alcohol recidivism and mortality. Methods: The study was a register-based cohort study of patients admitted for alcohol withdrawal 1998-2013 and treated with either phenobarbital or chlordiazepoxide. Patients were followed for one year. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) for benzodiazepine use, alcohol recidivism and mortality associated with alcohol withdrawal treatment, while adjusting for confounders. Results: A total of 1063 patients treated with chlordiazepoxide and 1365 patients treated with phenobarbital were included. After one year, the outcome rates per 100 person-years in the phenobarbital versus the chlordiazepoxide cohort were 9.20 vs. 5.13 for use of benzodiazepine, 37.9 vs. 37.9 for alcohol recidivism and 29 vs. 59 for mortality. Comparing phenobarbital to chlordiazepoxide treated, the HR of subsequent use of benzodiazepines was 1.56 (95%CI 1.05-2.30). Similarly, the HR for alcohol recidivism was 0.99 (95%CI 0.84-1.16). Lastly, the HR for 30-days and 1 year mortality was 0.25 (95%CI 0.08-0.78) and 0.51 (95%CI 0.31-0.86).

Phenobarbital, a long-acting barbiturate, presents an alternative to conventional benzodiazepine treatment, though existing research offers only modest guidance to the safety and effectiveness of phenobarbital in managing alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) in general hospital settings. Methods: To compare clinical effectiveness of phenobarbital versus benzodiazepines in managing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, we conducted a retrospective chart review of 562 patients admitted over a 2-year period to a general hospital and treated for AWS. The development of AWS-related complications (seizures, alcoholic hallucinosis, and alcohol withdrawal delirium) post-treatment initiation was the primary outcome examined in both treatment groups. Additional outcomes measured included hospital length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates/length of stay, medication-related adverse events, and discharge against medical advice. Results: Despite being significantly more likely to have a history of prior complications related to AWS (including seizures and delirium), patients initiated on phenobarbital (n = 143) had overall similar primary and secondary treatment outcomes to those in the benzodiazepine treatment protocol (n = 419). Additionally, a subset of patients (n = 16) initially treated with benzodiazepines displayed signs of treatment nonresponse, including significantly higher rates of AWS-related delirium and ICU admission rates, but were well-managed following transition to the phenobarbital protocol. Conclusion: The data from this retrospective chart review lend further support to effectiveness and safety of phenobarbital for the treatment and management of AWS.

The extent and severity of atopic eczema, the growth and nutrition of infants, and concentrations of circulating cytokines/chemokines and soluble cell surface adhesion molecules in serum and methyl-histamine and eosinophilic protein X in urine were determined. Results: The SCORAD score reflecting the extent and severity of atopic eczema was 16 (7-25) during breast-feeding, median (interquartile range). After 2 months, a significant improvement in skin condition occurred in patients given probiotic-supplemented formulas, as compared to the unsupplemented group; chi(2) = 12.27, P = 0.002. SCORAD decreased in the Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 group to 0 (0-3.8), and in the Lactobacillus GG group to 1 (0.1-8.7), vs unsupplemented 13.4 (4.5-18.2), median (interquartile range), in parallel with a reduction in the concentration of soluble CD4 in serum and eosinophilic protein X in urine. Conclusion: The results provide the first clinical demonstration of specific probiotic strains modifying the changes related to allergic inflammation. The data further indicate that probiotics may counteract inflammatory responses beyond the intestinal milieu. The combined effects of these probiotic strains will guide infants through the weaning period, when sensitization to newly encountered antigens is initiated. The probiotic approach may thus offer a new direction in the search for future foods for allergy treatment and prevention strategies.",0.26313433051109314
42,2019,30480774,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,"Background: Eczema is a common chronic skin condition. Probiotics have been proposed as an effective treatment for eczema; their use is increasing, as numerous clinical trials are under way. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2008, which suggested that probiotics may not be an effective treatment for eczema but identified areas in which evidence was lacking. Objectives: To assess the effects of probiotics for treating patients of all ages with eczema. Search methods: We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, the Global Resource of Eczema Trials (GREAT) database, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also handsearched a number of conference proceedings. We updated the searches of the main databases in January 2018 and of trials registries in March 2018, but we have not yet incorporated these results into the review. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of probiotics (live orally ingested micro-organisms) compared with no treatment, placebo, or other active intervention with no probiotics for the treatment of eczema diagnosed by a doctor. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. We recorded adverse events from the included studies and from a separate adverse events search conducted for the first review. We formally assessed reporting bias by preparing funnel plots, and we performed trial sequential analysis for the first primary outcome - eczema symptoms at the end of active treatment.We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome (in italic font). Main results: We included 39 randomised controlled trials involving 2599 randomised participants. We included participants of either gender, aged from the first year of life through to 55 years (only six studies assessed adults), who had mild to severe eczema. Trials were undertaken in primary and secondary healthcare settings, mainly in Europe or Asia. Duration of treatment ranged from four weeks to six months, and duration of follow-up after end of treatment ranged from zero to 36 months. We selected no standard dose: researchers used a variety of doses and concentrations of probiotics. The probiotics used were bacteria of the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria species, which were taken alone or combined with other probiotics, and were given with or without prebiotics. Comparators were no treatment, placebo, and other treatments with no probiotics.For all results described in this abstract, the comparator was no probiotics. Active treatment ranged from six weeks to three months for all of the following results, apart from the investigator-rated eczema severity outcome, for which the upper limit of active treatment was 16 weeks. With regard to score, the higher the score, the more severe were the symptoms. All key results reported in this abstract were measured at the end of active treatment, except for adverse events, which were measured during the active treatment period.Probiotics probably make little or no difference in participant- or parent-rated symptoms of eczema (13 trials; 754 participants): symptom severity on a scale from 0 to 20 was 0.44 points lower after probiotic treatment (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.22 to 0.33; moderate-quality evidence). Trial sequential analysis shows that target sample sizes of 258 and 456, which are necessary to demonstrate a minimum mean difference of -2 and -1.5, respectively, with 90% power, have been exceeded, suggesting that further trials with similar probiotic strains for this outcome at the end of active treatment may be futile.We found no evidence suggesting that probiotics make a difference in QoL for patients with eczema (six studies; 552 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.03, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.42; low-quality evidence) when measured by the participant or the parent using validated disease-specific QoL instruments.Probiotics may slightly reduce investigator-rated eczema severity scores (24 trials; 1596 participants). On a scale of 0 to 103 for total Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), a score combining investigator-rated eczema severity score and participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss was 3.91 points lower after probiotic treatment than after no probiotic treatment (95% CI -5.86 to -1.96; low-quality evidence). The minimum clinically important difference for SCORAD has been estimated to be 8.7 points.We noted significant to extreme levels of unexplainable heterogeneity between the results of individual studies. We judged most studies to be at unclear risk of bias; six studies had high attrition bias, and nine were at low risk of bias overall.We found no evidence to show that probiotics make a difference in the risk of adverse events during active treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.63; seven trials; 402 participants; low-quality evidence). Studies in our review that reported adverse effects described gastrointestinal symptoms. Authors' conclusions: Evidence suggests that, compared with no probiotic, currently available probiotic strains probably make little or no difference in improving patient-rated eczema symptoms. Probiotics may make little or no difference in QoL for people with eczema nor in investigator-rated eczema severity score (combined with participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss); for the latter, the observed effect was small and of uncertain clinical significance. Therefore, use of probiotics for the treatment of eczema is currently not evidence-based. This update found no evidence of increased adverse effects with probiotic use during studies, but a separate adverse events search from the first review revealed that probiotic treatment carries a small risk of adverse events.Results show significant, unexplainable heterogeneity between individual trial results. Only a small number of studies measured some outcomes.Future studies should better measure QoL scores and adverse events, and should report on new probiotics. Researchers should also consider studying subgroups of patients (e.g. patients with atopy or food allergies, adults) and standardising doses/concentrations of probiotics given.",0.15237084031105042

We also searched registries of ongoing clinical trials, conference proceedings and searched for adverse events. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of live orally ingested microorganisms for the treatment of eczema. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently applied eligibility criteria, assessed the quality of trials and extracted data. We contacted study authors for more information where necessary. We recorded adverse events from the included studies, and from the separate adverse events search. Main results: Twelve randomised controlled trials involving 781 participants met the inclusion criteria. All trial participants were children. There was no significant difference in participant or parent-rated symptom scores in favour of probiotic treatment (5 trials, 313 participants). Symptom severity on a scale from 0 to 20 was 0.90 points lower after probiotic treatment than after placebo (95%CI -1.04, 2.84; p = 0.36).There was also no significant difference in participant or parent-rated overall eczema severity in favour of probiotic treatment (3 trials, 150 participants). There was no significant difference in investigator rated eczema severity between probiotic and placebo treatments (7 trials, 588 participants). On a scale from 0 to 102 investigator rated eczema severity was 2.46 points lower after probiotic treatment than after placebo treatment (95%CI -2.53, 7.45 p = 0.33). Significant heterogeneity was noted between the results of individual studies, which may be explained by the use of different probiotic strains. Subgroup analysis by age of participant, severity of eczema, presence of atopy or presence of food allergy did not identify a population with different treatment outcomes to the population as a whole. The adverse events search identified some case reports of infections and bowel ischaemia caused by probiotics.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation during pregnancy and early infancy in preventing eczema, atopic eczema, and other allergic diseases. We also explored whether different probiotic strains or intervention objects affected the antiallergic effect of probiotics and the prevention atopy effect of the long-term period. Fixed-effect models were used, and random-effects models where significant heterogeneity was present. Results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Twenty-one studies were included in the meta-analysis. The probiotics group had a significantly lower risk of eczema and atopic eczema compared to controls, especially those treated with probiotic combinations. Mothers' probiotics intake significantly contributed to reducing the risk of eczema as well as atopic eczema. What's more, probiotics seemed effective on eczema prevention ≤2 years of age, but against atopic eczema after 1 of age year. No significant difference in terms of prevention of asthma, rhinitis, wheeze, allergic diseases and sensation.

42,2019,17349686,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,"Background: An altered microbial exposure may underlie the increase of allergic diseases in affluent societies. Probiotics may alleviate and even prevent eczema in infants. Objective: To prevent eczema and sensitization in infants with a family history of allergic disease by oral supplementation with the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri. Methods: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, which comprised 232 families with allergic disease, of whom 188 completed the study. The mothers received L reuteri ATCC 55730 (1 x 10(8) colony forming units) daily from gestational week 36 until delivery. Their babies then continued with the same product from birth until 12 months of age and were followed up for another year. Primary outcome was allergic disease, with or without positive skin prick test or circulating IgE to food allergens. Results: The cumulative incidence of eczema was similar, 36% in the treated versus 34% in the placebo group. The L reuteri group had less IgE-associated eczema during the second year, 8% versus 20% (P = .02), however. Skin prick test reactivity was also less common in the treated than in the placebo group, significantly so for infants with mothers with allergies, 14% versus 31% (P = .02). Wheeze and other potentially allergic diseases were not affected. Conclusion: Although a preventive effect of probiotics on infant eczema was not confirmed, the treated infants had less IgE-associated eczema at 2 years of age and therefore possibly run a reduced risk to develop later respiratory allergic disease.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of probiotics for treating eczema by performing a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Design: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, LILACS, ISI Web of Science, the reference lists of articles, ongoing clinical trial registers and conference proceedings. RCTs of live orally ingested microorganisms for the treatment of eczema were eligible for inclusion. Results: Twelve trials (781 participants) were identified. Meta-analysis of data from five of these trials showed that there was no significant reduction in eczema symptoms with probiotic treatment compared with placebo (mean difference -0.90 points on a 20-point visual analogue scale; 95% confidence interval -2.84, 1.04). Meta-analysis of data from seven trials showed no significant difference in investigator rated eczema severity between probiotic and placebo treatments. Subgroup analysis by eczema severity or presence of atopy did not identify a specific population in which probiotic treatment was effective. There was significant heterogeneity between studies; however, the results of three studies that used the same probiotic strain were concordant. The adverse events search identified case reports of sepsis and bowel ischaemia caused by probiotics. Conclusions: Currently, probiotics cannot be recommended for treating eczema. The heterogeneity between studies may be attributable to probiotic strain-specific effects, which means that novel probiotic strains may still have a role in eczema management.",0.08491706848144531

Objective: To determine whether probiotic supplementation in early life could prevent development of eczema and atopy at 2 years. Methods: Double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial of infants at risk of allergic disease. Pregnant women were randomized to take Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (L rhamnosus), Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis strain HN019 or placebo daily from 35 weeks gestation until 6 months if breast-feeding, and their infants were randomized to receive the same treatment from birth to 2 years (n = 474). The infant's cumulative prevalence of eczema and point prevalence of atopy, using skin prick tests to common allergens, was assessed at 2 years. Results: Infants receiving L rhamnosus had a significantly (P = .01) reduced risk of eczema (hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.85) compared with placebo, but this was not the case for B animalis subsp lactis (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.58-1.41). There was no significant effect of L rhamnosus (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.46-1.18) or B animalis subsp lactis (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.52-1.28) on atopy. L rhamnosus (71.5%) was more likely than B animalis subsp lactis (22.6%) to be present in the feces at 3 months, although detection rates were similar by 24 months. Conclusion: We found that supplementation with L rhamnosus, but not B animalis subsp lactis, substantially reduced the cumulative prevalence of eczema, but not atopy, by 2 years.

42,2019,30790361,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,"Background: Allergic diseases are common and represent a considerable health and economic burden worldwide. We aimed to examine the effect of a combination of two probiotic strains administered in late infancy and early childhood on the development of allergic diseases and sensitization. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial, participants were randomized to receive a daily mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis or placebo-starting prior to attending day care. The intervention period was 6 months, and the parents answered web-based questionnaires on allergic symptoms and doctor's diagnosed allergic disease monthly. IgE was measured at baseline and follow-up. Results: A total of 290 participants were randomized: 144 in the probiotic group and 146 in the placebo group. Mean age at intervention start was 10.1 months. At follow-up (mean age 16.1 months), the incidence of eczema was 4.2% in the probiotic group and 11.5% in the placebo group (P = 0.036). The incidence of asthma and conjunctivitis did not differ between groups, and no children presented with rhinitis. Sensitization was equal in the two groups at intervention start (7.5% and 9.5%, respectively), and two children in each group were sensitized during the intervention. Conclusions: We observed a significantly lower incidence of eczema in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group.

Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind controlled trial of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation on the cumulative incidence of eczema (primary end point) and asthma and rhinitis (secondary end points) in high-risk infants. For the first 6 months of life, intervention infants ( n = 92) received a daily dose of 10 billion colony-forming units of LGG and 225 mg of inulin (Amerifit Brands, Cromwell, CT), and control infants ( n = 92) received 325 mg of inulin alone. We used survival analysis methods to estimate disease incidences in the presence or absence of LGG and to estimate the efficacy of LGG in delaying or preventing these diseases. Results: Infants were accrued over a 6-year period (median follow-up: 4.6 years; 95% retention rate at 2 years). At 2 years of age, the estimated cumulative incidence of eczema was 30.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.4%-40.4%) in the control arm and 28.7% (95% CI, 19.4%-38.0%) in the LGG arm, for a hazard ratio of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.59-1.53) (log-rank P = .83).

42,2019,24947281,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,"Objective: To evaluate a multistrain, high-dose probiotic in the prevention of eczema. Design: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. Settings: Antenatal clinics, research clinic, children at home. Patients: Pregnant women and their infants. Interventions: Women from 36 weeks gestation and their infants to age 6 months received daily either the probiotic (Lactobacillus salivarius CUL61, Lactobacillus paracasei CUL08, Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis CUL34 and Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20; total of 10(10) organisms/day) or matching placebo. Main outcome measure: Diagnosed eczema at age 2 years. Infants were followed up by questionnaire. Clinical examination and skin prick tests to common allergens were done at 6 months and 2 years. Results: The cumulative frequency of diagnosed eczema at 2 years was similar in the probiotic (73/214, 34.1%) and placebo arms (72/222, 32.4%; OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.6). Among the secondary outcomes, the cumulative frequency of skin prick sensitivity at 2 years was reduced in the probiotic (18/171; 10.5%) compared with the placebo arm (32/173; 18.5%; OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.98). The statistically significant differences between the arms were mainly in sensitisation to cow's milk and hen's egg proteins at 6 months.

Potentially beneficial dietary interventions include identifying and treating blood glucose dysregulation, identifying and avoiding allergenic foods, and avoiding suspected triggering agents such as alcohol, aspartame, and monosodium glutamate. The ketogenic diet may be considered for severe, treatment-resistant cases. The Atkins diet (very low in carbohydrates) is a less restrictive type of ketogenic diet that may be effective in some cases. Nutrients that may reduce seizure frequency include vitamin B6, magnesium, vitamin E, manganese, taurine, dimethylglycine, and omega-3 fatty acids. Administration of thiamine may improve cognitive function in patients with epilepsy. Supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6, biotin, vitamin D, and L-carnitine may be needed to prevent or treat deficiencies resulting from the use of anticonvulsant drugs. Vitamin K1 has been recommended near the end of pregnancy for women taking anticonvulsants. Melatonin may reduce seizure frequency in some cases, and progesterone may be useful for women with cyclic exacerbations of seizures. In most cases, nutritional therapy is not a substitute for anticonvulsant medications. However, in selected cases, depending on the effectiveness of the interventions, dosage reductions or discontinuation of medications may be possible.",0.16099543869495392

In this review we will summarize evidence from randomized controlled trials. Objectives: To assess if vitamins improve seizure control, reduce adverse effects of AEDs or improve the quality of life in people with epilepsy. Search strategy: We searched MEDLINE from 1966 to 2004, the Cochrane Epilepsy Group trials register (December 2004), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register) (TheCochraneLibrary Issue 4, 2004), and cross-references from identified studies. Selection criteria: Randomized or quasi-randomized studies investigating the effects of one or more vitamins given alone or in addition to AEDs to people of any age with any type of epilepsy. Data collection and analysis: Both reviewers assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted the data. Outcomes assessed included seizure frequency, gingival hyperplasia, neuropathy, changes in bone mineral content, serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, hemogram, serum levels of AEDs, neuropsychological and quality of life outcomes. Primary analyses were by intention to treat. Main results: Fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria and were of poor methodological quality. None described randomization methods and most enrolled small numbers of participants. Nine studies (331 participants) investigated folic acid. Two studies (75 participants) found no effect for the outcome 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.32 to 2.29). Also, no evidence was found for an effect on gingival health, intelligence, behavior, mental health or personality, or measures of red blood volume and hemoglobin content. Folic acid was not associated with any consistent changes in serum phenytoin or phenobarbitone levels or improvement in the mean motor conduction velocities of peripheral nerves. One small study (72 participants) found that thiamine improves neuropsychological functions related to psychomotor speed, visuospatial abilities, selective attention and verbal abstracting ability. One study (226 participants) found a significantly higher bone mineral content (BMC) among patients with epilepsy taking AEDs with vitamin D supplementation compared to controls who were not given supplementation (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.48 to 4.72; p 0.00001). The studies found no significant effects on serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase or general well-being. One small study (24 participants) found a significant decrease in seizure frequency in those treated with vitamin E compared to placebo (p = 0.00005; Peto OR 26.73; 95% CI 5.46 to 130.92). Authors' conclusions: In view of methodological deficiencies and limited number of individual studies, we have found no reliable evidence to support the routine use of vitamins in patients with epilepsy. Further trials are needed, especially to assess the utility of vitamin D supplementation to prevent osteomalacia and the role of vitamin E on seizures and thiamine in improving cognitive functions.",0.1701669692993164

Patients and methods: The study included 90 consecutive patients with epilepsy after stroke. Patients were randomly divided into groups of 30 each according to treatment: single-agent or combination anti-epileptic therapy with oxcarbazepine and sodium valproate (control group), anti-epileptic therapy with compound vitamin B tablets (observation group 1), and anti-epileptic therapy with vitamin B12 (mecobalamin) (observation group 2). After 12 months, treatment effects were assessed and compared among groups. Results: Compared with the control group, observation group 2 had better epilepsy control and observation group 1 had no difference in efficacy. New-onset stroke was seen in three cases (10%) of the control group and in two cases (6.7%) of observation group 1. This was not seen in observation group 2. In the control group and observation group 1, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score significantly decreased after 6 months, but increased again at 12 months. Conversely, NIHSS score continuously decreased during follow-up in observation group 2. The plasma level of asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) gradually increased in the control group and observation group 1, but remained unchanged in observational group 2. The differences in NIHSS scores and plasma ADMA levels between the control and observation groups were statistically significant. Conclusions: Anti-epilepsy drugs combined with B vitamins can improve epilepsy control after stroke and reduce new stroke occurrence. This effect may be associated with stability of plasma ADMA levels. Vitamin B12 may be better than vitamin B complex in the treatment of epilepsy after stroke.",0.21439941227436066

Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of pregnancies in women with epilepsy enrolled in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study from 1999 to 2008. Data on ASM and vitamin supplement use were collected from questionnaires. We analyzed maternal plasma concentrations of ASM and metabolites of folate, including unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA), riboflavin (vitamin B2), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and niacin (vitamin B3) during gestational weeks 17-19. Results: We included 227 singleton pregnancies exposed to ASM with available plasma samples (median maternal age 29 years, range 18 to 41 years). From the preconception period to gestational week 20, any supplement of folic acid was reported in 208 of pregnancies (94%), riboflavin in 72 (33%), pyridoxine in 77 (35%), and niacin in 45 (20%). High ASM concentrations correlated with high concentrations of UMFA and inactive folate metabolites, and with low concentrations of riboflavin and metabolically active pyridoxine. There was no association between ASM and niacin status. Significance: ASM concentrations during pregnancy were associated with vitamin B status in pregnant women with epilepsy. Additional studies are needed to determine the clinical impact of these findings, and to define the optimal vitamin doses that should be recommended to improve pregnancy outcomes.",0.11030001193284988

The search keywords included ""vitamin or folate or folic acid or biotin or thiamine or carnitine or zinc or manganese or selenium or omega-3 fatty acid or linoleic acid or micronutrient or trace element or supplementation"" AND ""epilepsy or seizure"". Results: We could identify 26 related articles. Seventeen studies provided class 2 of evidence and the rest provided class 3 of evidence. Eight studies investigated polyunsaturated fats, seven groups studied folic acid, four studies explored the effects of vitamin D, two investigated vitamin E, and three others studied multivitamin cocktails. There was one study on zinc and one on selenium. There is some evidence on the efficacy of polyunsaturated fats in treating seizures in PWE. The evidence on the efficacy of multivitamin cocktails in adults is promising. Conclusion: High quality data on the efficacy of nutritional (vitamins-minerals) supplementations in treating seizures in PWE is scarce; however, designing future clinical trials of polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for drug-resistant seizures in adults with focal epilepsy and in children, and also multivitamin supplementations in adults with focal epilepsy seems reasonable and promising.

Here, we measured serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and normalized it by administration of vitamin D3 in 13 patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. To see if vitamin D3 has an impact on seizure frequency, we compared seizure numbers during a 90-day period before and after treatment onset. We found that seizure numbers significantly decreased upon vitamin D3 supplementation. Median seizure reduction was 40%. We conclude that the normalization of serum vitamin 25(OH)D level has an anticonvulsant effect.",0.9898888468742371

Elevated total Hcy levels (hyper-tHcy) have been associated with cardiovascular disease in multiple large-scale epidemiologic studies and, in particular, patients with epilepsy exhibit elevated plasma tHcy levels more frequently than the general population caused by polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene and chronic treatment with older antiepileptic drugs. Folic acid alone or folic acid combined with other B-vitamins have all been shown to reduce tHcy concentration in patients on chronic treatment with antiepileptic drugs, however, which is the most appropriate supplementation scheme of folic acid and/or B-vitamins in patients with epilepsy still remains matter of debate.

44,2019,30112988,Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,vitamins epilepsy,0.0,"Background: The impact of antiepileptics on serum vitamin levels is controversial and uncertain. With no clear conclusions on the impact of antiepileptics on serum levels of vitamins, there is a need for further clinical studies in order to ascertain the impact of old and newer antiepileptic drugs on serum levels of vitamins in epileptic patients, thus accomplishing a suitable usage of vitamins supplementation. Objective: The intention of the present research is to confirm the hypothesis of whether or not vitamin levels are altered with antiepileptic drugs. The study also aims to reveal which vitamin levels are particularly more altered, are vitamin levels affected by gender and the type and number of antiepileptics used. Methods: The present research was piloted in collaboration with the Department of Neurology in Qilu Hospital of Shandong University. A total of 63 serum samples of epileptic patients receiving antiepileptics as monotherapy or polytherapy were requested for analysis of nine vitamin serum levels. Total nine vitamins (B1, B2, B6, B9, B12, A, C, D and E) in epileptic patients receiving antiepileptic drugs were analyzed. The serum results of all vitamins were compiled and evaluated with SPSS. Results: It was alarmingly found that serum levels of vitamin D were particularly very low in almost all (90%) epileptic patients in this study. Notably, serum levels of vitamin C and vitamin B1 were also below reference range in 72% and 46% epileptic patients, respectively. The remaining vitamins were almost in reference range for most of the patients. In our study, mean and frequency of vitamin D, C and B1 levels do not vary too much among different gender groups. The patients receiving newer antiepileptic drugs displayed a slightly increased serum vitamin D levels in comparison to the patients receiving older antiepileptic drugs. We found low vitamin D, C and B1 serum levels in patients who were on monotherapy as in comparison with patients on polytherapy. Conclusion: The most significant and surprising finding of this study revealed that serum vitamin D levels in particular were very low in almost all patients and in some patients' vitamin B1 serum levels were also below the reference range. More importantly, it is first time reported here that vitamin C serum levels were also below reference range in the majority of these Chinese epileptic patients. It is recommended that all these vitamins should be regularly monitored in addition to therapeutic drug monitoring of antiepileptic drugs. Additional clinical trials are required for further evaluation. It is also recommended that epileptic patients with low serum levels of these vitamins may be prescribed vitamins supplementations with antiepileptic drugs in order to control their seizures more effectively and efficiently.",0.5339906215667725

The therapeutic role of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6, may not be replaced with other forms of vitamin B6 sometimes. Until now, four inborn errors of metabolism are known to affect vitamin B6 concentrations in the brain. Three of them are hyperprolinemia type 2, antiquitin deficiency, and pyridoxine phosphate oxidase deficiency. The fourth disorder occurs in neonates with hypophosphatasia and congenital rickets. All patients with these conditions present with early-onset epilepsy that is resistant to conventional antiepileptic medications. Patients with three of the conditions respond to any form of vitamin B6. Only those with pyridoxine phosphate oxidase deficiency respond to PLP instead of pyridoxine. Interestingly, the authors have successfully treated many patients without the above four disorders using vitamin B6, and have found that the treatment was more effective with PLP than with pyridoxine, though the mechanism is not known. Since PLP is as inexpensive as pyridoxine, we suggest replacing PLP for pyridoxine when treating children with epilepsy.",0.07888168096542358

The condition can be manifested either due to genetic predisposition or acquired from acute insult which leads to alteration of cellular and molecular mechanisms. Evaluating the latest and the current knowledge in regard to the mechanisms underlying molecular and cellular alteration, hyperexcitability is a consequence of an imbalanced state wherein enhance excitatory glutamatergic and reduced inhibitory GABAergic signaling is considered to be accountable for seizures associated damage. However, neurodegeneration contributing to epileptogenesis has become increasingly appreciated. The components at the helm of neurodegenerative alterations during epileptogenesis include GABAergic neuronal and receptor changes, neuroinflammation, alteration in axonal transport, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and other cellular as well as functional changes. Targeting neurodegeneration with vitamin E as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective may prove to be one of the therapeutic approaches useful in managing epilepsy. In this review, we discuss and converse about the seizure-induced episodes as a link for the development of neurodegenerative and pathological consequences of epilepsy.

A number of studies have explored the effects of caffeine in asthma, this is the first review to systematically examine and summarise the evidence. Objectives: To assess the effects of caffeine on lung function and identify whether there is a need to control for caffeine consumption prior to either lung function or exhaled nitric oxide testing. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and the reference lists of articles (August 2009). We also contacted study authors. Selection criteria: Randomised clinical trials of oral caffeine compared to placebo or coffee compared to decaffeinated coffee in adults with asthma. Data collection and analysis: Trial selection, quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers. Main results: Seven trials involving a total of 75 people with mild to moderate asthma were included. The studies were all of cross-over design .Six trials involving 55 people showed that in comparison with placebo, caffeine, even at a 'low dose' ( 5mg/kg body weight), appears to improve lung function for up to two hours after consumption. Forced expiratory volume in one minute showed a small improvement up to two hours after caffeine ingestion (SMD 0.72; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.20), which translates into a 5% mean difference in FEV1. However in two studies the mean differences in FEV1 were 12% and 18% after caffeine. Mid-expiratory flow rates also showed a small improvement with caffeine and this was sustained up to four hours.One trial involving 20 people examined the effect of drinking coffee versus a decaffeinated variety on the exhaled nitric oxide levels in patients with asthma and concluded that there was no significant effect on this outcome. Authors' conclusions: Caffeine appears to improve airways function modestly, for up to four hours, in people with asthma . People may need to avoid caffeine for at least four hours prior to lung function testing, as caffeine ingestion could cause misinterpretation of the results. Drinking caffeinated coffee before taking exhaled nitric oxide measurements does not appear to affect the results of the test, but more studies are needed to confirm this.",0.1693578064441681

After 48 hours of withdrawal of all methylxanthines, 13 patients received caffeine and 10 received theophylline. Significant improvements in forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced expiratory flow rates occurred from one to six hours after administration of either caffeine or theophylline. The bronchodilator effect of caffeine did not differ significantly from that of theophylline and was maximal two hours after ingestion of each drug. Peak serum levels of caffeine (13.5 +/- 2.9 mg per liter) occurred at one hour, and peak levels of theophylline (8.4 +/- 1.7 mg per liter) at 2.2 +/- 0.8 hours. The mean serum half-time for caffeine was 3.9 +/- 1.4 hours and that for theophylline was 5.8 +/- 1.7 hours. All patients receiving caffeine metabolized it to paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline. Mild, transient side effects were seen after both caffeine and theophylline.

The prevalence of bronchial asthma was inversely related with the level of coffee intake. Compared with subjects who did not drink coffee, the age- and sex-adjusted relative risks were 0.95 for one cup, 0.77 for two and 0.72 for three or more cups per day. This inverse relation was of comparable magnitude at younger and older ages, not explainable through selection, since the sample was representative of the general Italian population and the participation rate was 93.4 percent, or through confounding by several identified potential distorting factors. Thus, the results of this survey provide epidemiologic confirmation of previous clinical observations that caffeine intake has a bronchodilator effect in asthma, and indirectly suggest that long-term moderate coffee consumption may not only reduce symptoms, but also prevent the clinical manifestation of bronchial asthma. An alternative explanation of these findings is that subjects receiving treatment for asthma might tend to reduce their coffee consumption, in consequence of the side effects shared by sympathomimetics, theophylline and caffeine. Thus, further studies taking simultaneously into account methylxanthine intake from beverages and drug treatments are required before considering causal the apparent protection which emerged.",0.1397973746061325

Methods: Cross-sectional study of 2,832 adults aged 18-79 years in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Multivariable logistic or linear regression was used for the analysis of urinary levels of caffeine or each of its three major metabolites (paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline) and current asthma, lung function, and FeNO. Results: Subjects with urinary paraxanthine levels in the fourth quartile (Q4) had 53% lower odds of current asthma than those whose urinary paraxanthine levels were in the first quartile (Q1; 95% confidence = 0.22 to 1.00). Among never and former smokers, subjects with urinary theophylline levels above Q1 had 49% lower odds of current asthma than those whose urinary theophylline level was in Q1 (95% CI = 0.31 to 0.85).

Ten asthmatic subjects with EIB (exercise-induced bronchoconstriction) participated in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy crossover study. One hour before an exercise challenge, each subject was given 0, 3, 6, or 9 mg/kg of caffeine or placebo mixed in a flavored sugar drink. Fifteen minutes before the exercise bout, an inhaler containing either albuterol (180 microg) or placebo was administered to each subject.

Workers whose job involves walking long distances have an even higher tendency to suffer from low back pain. A positive effect of insoles in reducing low back pain was found in professional sports players. This was not examined on people whose job involves walking long distances. In this double blind prospective study we examined the effectiveness of insoles constructed in a computerized method to placebo insoles in 58 employees whose work entailed extensive walking and who suffered from low back pain. The evaluation was performed by the MILLION questionnaire, which is considered as a valid questionnaire for evaluation of low back pain. We calculated the differences of the pain intensity before and after the intervention, in the employees using the insoles manufactured by computer in comparison to the users of the placebo insoles. In each group, the analysis was performed in comparison to the baseline. A total of 81% of the employees preferred the real insoles as effective and comfortable in comparison to 19% of the users of the placebo insoles (P 0.05). The results of this study indicate a substantial improvement in the low back pain after the use of the true insoles. The average pain intensity according to the MILLION questionnaire before the use of the insoles was 5.46.

Orthotic insoles with a directly integrated heel lift were used to reduce this asymmetry and thus the associated low-back pain. The aim of this study was to analyze the biomechanical adaptations of the locomotor apparatus during gait and the subjective pain ratings before and after the establishment of orthotic insole use. Methods: Eight patients with mild leg length discrepancy (≤2.0 cm) underwent three-dimensional biomechanical analysis while walking before and after 3 weeks of orthotic insole use. Low-back pain was assessed separately before both measurement sessions using a visual analog scale. Results: Analysis of the kinematic parameters highlighted individual adaptations. The symmetry index of Dingwell indicated that orthotic insoles had no significant effect on the kinematic gait parameters and an unpredictable effect across patients. Orthotic insole use significantly and systematically (in all of the patients) reduced low-back pain (P .05), which was correlated with changes in ankle kinematics (P = .02, r = 0.80). Conclusions: The effects of orthotic insoles on gait symmetry are unpredictable and specific to each patient's individual manner of biomechanical compensation. The reduction in low-back pain seems to be associated with the improved ankle kinematics during gait.",0.6152968406677246
47,2019,24775807,Can insoles treat back pain?,insoles back pain,0.0,"Background: Low back pain (LBP) is a significant public health problem in Western industrialised countries and has been reported to affect up to 80% of adults at some stage in their lives. It is associated with high health care utilisation costs, disability, work loss and restriction of social activities. An intervention of foot orthoses or insoles has been suggested to reduce the risk of developing LBP and be an effective treatment strategy for people suffering from LBP. However, despite the common usage of orthoses and insoles, there is a lack of clear guidelines for their use in relation to LBP. The aim of this review is to investigate the effectiveness of foot orthoses and insoles in the prevention and treatment of non specific LBP. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library was conducted in May 2013. Two authors independently reviewed and selected relevant randomised controlled trials. Quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool and the Downs and Black Checklist. Meta-analysis of study data were conducted where possible. Results: Eleven trials were included: five trials investigated the treatment of LBP (n=293) and six trials examined the prevention of LBP (n=2379) through the use of foot orthoses or insoles. Meta-analysis showed no significant effect in favour of the foot orthoses or insoles for either the treatment trials (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.74, CI 95%: -1.5 to 0.03) or the prevention trials (relative risk (RR) 0.78, CI 95%: 0.50 to 1.23). Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of insoles or foot orthoses as either a treatment for LBP or in the prevention of LBP. The small number, moderate methodological quality and the high heterogeneity of the available trials reduce the strength of current findings. Future research should concentrate on identification of LBP patients most suited to foot orthoses or insole treatment, as there is some evidence that trials structured along these lines have a greater effect on reducing LBP.",0.22124452888965607

Methods: Database searches were conducted using PubMed, EBSCO, GALE, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov. The biomedical literature was reviewed to determine the current state of knowledge on the benefits of foot orthotics for low back pain related to biomechanical mechanisms and clinical outcomes. Results: It may be argued that foot orthotics are experimental, investigational, or unproven for low back pain due to lack of sufficient evidence for their clinical effectiveness. This conclusion is based upon lack of high quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, there is extensive research on biomechanical mechanisms underlying the benefits of orthotics that may be used to address this gap. Additionally, promising pilot studies are beginning to emerge in the literature and ongoing large-scale RCTs are addressing effects of foot orthotics on chronic low back pain. Conclusions: Based upon the critical evaluation of the current research on foot orthotics related to biomechanical mechanisms and clinical outcomes, recommendations for future research to address the evidence-practice gaps on the use of foot orthotics for low back pain are presented.",0.5956999063491821

High levels of low back pain and lower extremity pain were reported by workers on the plant floor, but low back pain was poorly correlated to lower extremity pain (r = 0.371). The effect of insoles on the subset of 40 workers was to lower low back pain by 38%, foot pain by 37%, and knee pain by 38% (p .001).

Methods: The study recruited 50 patients with chronic low back pain through media advertising in a midwestern suburban area. Medical history and a low back examination were completed at a chiropractic clinic. Subjects were randomized to either a treatment group receiving custom-made shoe orthotics or a wait-list control group. After 6 weeks, the wait-list control group also received custom-made orthotics. This study measured change in perceived pain levels (Visual Analog Scale) and functional health status (Oswestry Disability Index) in patients with chronic low back pain at the end of 6 weeks of orthotic treatment compared with no treatment and at the end of 12 weeks of orthotic treatment. Results: This study showed changes in back pain and disability with the use of shoe orthotics for 6 weeks compared with a wait-list control group. It appears that improvement was maintained through the 12-week visit, but the subjects did not continue to improve during this time. Conclusions: This pilot study showed that the measurement of shoe orthotics to reduce low back pain and discomfort after 6 weeks of use is feasible.

Clinical trials with sulfasalazine have used an array of measures of disease activity, such as the number of tender and swollen joints, Ritchie articular index (RAI) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). In randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, sulfasalazine was associated with statistically significant benefits for various measures of disease activity, according to results of individual trials and/or meta-analysis. Sulfasalazine was associated with broadly similar efficacy to that of various other DMARDs in several randomised, double-blind, comparative trials. Promising results have also been demonstrated with sulfasalazine in combination with other DMARDs (e.g. methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine) in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis and in those with more established disease. Sulfasalazine was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse effects being adverse gastrointestinal effects, headache, dizziness and rash; myelosuppression can also occur. Sulfasalazine has a relatively short lag time until its onset of action and is often considered to be among the more efficacious traditional DMARDs. Based on considerations of safety, convenience and cost, many rheumatologists (particularly outside of the US) select sulfasalazine as initial therapy, although preferred first-line treatment options vary between countries.",0.3192841410636902

We examine whether there was a correlation between diplotype configurations (combinations of 2 haplotypes for a subject) at the NAT2 gene and the adverse effects of SSZ used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: The findings from 144 patients with RA who had been treated with SSZ were collected from our outpatient department and used for a retrospective study. Haplotype analysis was performed by the maximum-likelihood estimation based on the EM algorithm using the obtained polymorphism data. Results: Sixteen patients (11.1%) had experienced adverse effects from SSZ, the most common being allergic reactions including rash and fever. The slow acetylators who had no NAT2*4 haplotype had experienced adverse effects more frequently (62.5%) than the fast acetylators who had at least one NAT2*4 haplotype (8.1%) (p 0.001, OR 7.73, 95% CI 3.54-16.86). In 25% of the slow acetylators, the adverse effects were so severe that they were hospitalized.

Methods: We used a nationwide Japanese multicenter RA database to extract data from 2005 and 2014. To identify PJP cases, we selected patients hospitalized for PJP and verified their diagnosis. Two control groups, one unmatched and the other matched for age, sex, glucocorticoid, methotrexate, and tacrolimus dosage, and the use (and type, if used) of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug were selected by incidence-density sampling. The odds ratios for PJP associated with sulfasalazine use and other clinical factors were estimated by exact and standard conditional logistic regression. Results: From 18,668 participants, 60 cases, 356 unmatched controls, and 337 matched controls were selected. None of the cases received sulfasalazine before PJP onset. A comparison of the cases with the unmatched controls showed that sulfasalazine use carried a decreased risk of PJP (adjusted odds ratio 0.18, 95% confidence interval 0.00-0.92). A comparison of the cases and matched controls also showed that sulfasalazine use had a decreased risk of PJP (0.08, 0.00-0.36). In an analysis of the cases and unmatched controls who did not receive sulfasalazine, an increased risk of PJP was associated with lung disease (3.88, 1.89-7.95) and the use of glucocorticoid (5.71, 2.68-12.19), methotrexate (5.25, 2.01-13.74), and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (2.32, 1.10-4.93). Conclusions: The results of this nested case-control study demonstrated the preventive effect of sulfasalazine against PJP.

We report a case in a 63-year-old woman who had been on sulfasalazine for 2 months to treat rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted a few days after onset of a flu-like syndrome with a pruriginous maculopapular erythema initially involving the face, trunk, and proximal limbs; a fever of 41 degrees C; and enlargement of the liver, spleen, and several peripheral lymph nodes. Blood tests showed marked eosinophilia (9300/mm3), lymphocytosis, hyperbasophilic cells, and severe inflammation. DRESS syndrome was diagnosed. An indirect immunofluorescence assay for human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) was positive, supporting recent HHV6 infection. Primary HHV6 infection and HHV6 reactivation have been incriminated in the genesis of DRESS syndrome. DRESS syndrome continues to carry a high mortality rate of about 10%. Drugs previously reported to cause DRESS syndrome include sulfasalazine, hydantoin, d-penicillamine, allopurinol, hydrochlorothiazide, and cyclosporine. A high index of suspicion for DRESS syndrome should be maintained in patients receiving these drugs.

49,2019,7588084,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,"Sulfasalazine was first used for rheumatic polyarthritis in the 1940s and in the past 2 decades has become firmly established as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). The drug is split by the action of bacterial azoreductases in the large intestine into sulfapyridine and mesalazine (mesalamine, 5-aminosalicylic acid), although whether the parent molecule or the sulfapyridine moiety, or both, is the active principle remains uncertain. Sulfasalazine is an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), producing improvements in disease parameters similar to those seen with penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine or oral or parenteral gold in comparative clinical trials. However, there are no direct comparisons of the drug with methotrexate. Most adverse events associated with sulfasalazine are minor and tend to occur within 3 months of starting therapy. A meta-analysis of studies investigating DMARD therapy, which included almost 5000 evaluable patients, concluded that sulfasalazine was close to methotrexate in terms of efficacy but was slightly less well tolerated. However, unlike sulfasalazine, many DMARDs may be unsuitable for women who are, or may become, pregnant because of their potential to cause teratogenic effects. Sulfasalazine may also offer a more rapid onset of action than other DMARDs and may slow down the radiological progression of RA. Combination therapy with other DMARDs, particularly methotrexate, appears more effective than single DMARD therapy. If the safety of these regimens is shown in large numbers of patients they are likely to become more widely used in the future. Sulfasalazine is a therapy of first choice in patients with RA and may be the DMARD of choice in women who are, or may become, pregnant.",0.18010975420475006

The responses of patients with rheumatoid arthritis to treatment with a single so-called disease-modifying drug, such as methotrexate, are often suboptimal. Despite limited data, many patients are treated with combinations of these drugs. Methods: We enrolled 102 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and poor responses to at least one disease-modifying drug in a two-year, double-blind, randomized study of treatment with methotrexate alone (7.5 to 17.5 mg per week), the combination of sulfasalazine (500 mg twice daily) and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily), or all three drugs. The dose of methotrexate was adjusted in an attempt to achieve remission in all patients. The primary and point of the study was the successful completion of two years of treatment with 50 percent improvement in composite symptoms of arthritis and no evidence of drug toxicity. Results: Fifty of the 102 patients had 50 percent improvement at nine months and maintained at least that degree of improvement for two years without evidence of major drug toxicity. Among them were 24 of 31 patients treated with all three drugs (77 percent), 12 of 36 patients treated with methotrexate alone (33 percent, P 0.001 for the comparison with the three-drug group), and 14 of 35 patients treated with sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine (40 percent), P = 0.003 for the comparison with the three-drug group). Seven patients in the methotrexate group and three patients in each of the other two groups discontinued treatment because of drug toxicity. Conclusions: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, combination therapy with methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine is more effective than either methotrexate alone or a combination of sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine.",0.1430230736732483

Objective: To compare the benefits and side effects of TwHF extract with those of sulfasalazine for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis. Design: Randomized, controlled trial. A computer-generated code with random, permuted blocks was used to assign treatment. Setting: 2 U.S. academic centers (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, and University of Texas, Dallas, Texas) and 9 rheumatology subspecialty clinics (in Dallas and Austin, Texas; Tampa and Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Arlington, Virginia; Duncanville, Pennsylvania; Wheaton and Greenbelt, Maryland; and Lansing, Michigan). Patients: 121 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and 6 or more painful and swollen joints. Intervention: TwHF extract, 60 mg 3 times daily, or sulfasalazine, 1 g twice daily. Patients could continue stable doses of oral prednisone or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but had to stop taking disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs at least 28 days before randomization. Measurements: The primary outcome was the rate of achievement of 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR 20) at 24 weeks. Secondary end points were safety; radiographic scores of joint damage; and serum levels of interleukin-6, cholesterol, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Results: Outcome data were available for only 62 patients at 24 weeks. In a mixed-model analysis that imputed data for patients who dropped out, 65.0% (95% CI, 51.6% to 76.9%) of the TwHF group and 32.8% (CI, 21.3% to 46.0%) of the sulfasalazine group met the ACR 20 response criteria (P=0.001). Patients receiving TwHF also had significantly higher response rates for ACR 50 and ACR 70 in mixed-model analyses. Analyses of only completers showed similar significant differences between the treatment groups. Significant improvement was demonstrated in all individual components of the ACR response, including the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability score. Interleukin-6 levels rapidly and significantly decreased in the TwHF group. Although not statistically significant, radiographic progression was lower in the TwHF group. The frequency of adverse events was similar in both groups. Limitations: Only 62% and 41% of patients continued receiving TwHF extract and sulfasalazine, respectively, during the 24 weeks of the study. Long-term outcome data were not collected on participants who discontinued treatment. Conclusion: In patients who continued treatment for 24 weeks and could also use stable oral prednisone and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, attainment of the ACR 20 response criteria was significantly greater with TwHF extract than with sulfasalazine.",0.12811319530010223

Methods: An observational database of 1088 patients and 5141 patient years of DMARD treatment (2680 courses) from two academic hospitals was filtered for treatment with LEF, MTX, and SSZ. LEF treatment groups were matched for patients' age, baseline ESR, number of previous DMARDs, and hospital cohort with MTX and SSZ treatment groups. For these treatments, Kaplan-Meier analyses of time until the drug was discontinued (drug ""survival""), and the effectiveness and safety of continuation of treatment, were performed. The change in disease activity markers (CRP, ESR) was compared between the groups. Results: The median dose during the study increased from 10 to 15 mg MTX/week and from 1.5 to 2.0 g SSZ/day. Matched survival analysis showed better retention rates for MTX (mean (SEM) survival 28 (1) months) than for LEF (20 (1) months; p=0.001), whereas retention rates of SSZ (23 (1) months) were similar to those of LEF (p=NS). Treatments were stopped earlier because of adverse events (AEs, 3 months) than because of ineffectiveness (IE, 10 months; p 0.001). LEF and MTX were less likely to be stopped because of AEs than SSZ. LEF courses were stopped earlier for AEs (p 0.001) than MTX. Conclusions: Current dosing strategies should be re-evaluated, and coping strategies for common AEs should be investigated. This will be necessary to achieve better drug retention of LEF. At present, MTX continues to be the most effective drug in clinical practice.",0.12033455073833466

The current study compared functional disability in cohorts of patients with RA from the initial study who volunteered to continue treatment with leflunomide or sulfasalazine. Methods: The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) was used to assess functional ability in patients completing 6 months of therapy who chose to continue in double blinded 12 and 24 month extensions. Patients on active regimens continued taking leflunomide 20 mg/day or sulfasalazine 2 g/day; those taking placebo were switched at Month 6 to sulfasalazine. Results: Leflunomide significantly improved patients' functional ability compared to placebo (p or = 0.0001) and sulfasalazine (p or = 0.01) at 6 months. These changes were seen as early as Month 1, and continued improvements were seen in 12 and 24 month cohorts. Mean HAQ scores were significantly improved with leflunomide compared with sulfasalazine at 24 months (-0.65 vs -0.36; p = 0.0149); corresponding changes in HAQ Disability Index (DI) were -0.73 vs -0.56 and were not statistically different. Leflunomide is safe and well tolerated and no unexpected adverse events were noted during the 2 year period; diarrhea, nausea, and alopecia were less frequent with continued treatment. Conclusion: These longterm data confirm leflunomide improves functional ability as shown by reductions in HAQ scores. The benefit of leflunomide is reflected in other efficacy criteria, such as global assessments and the American College of Rheumatology response rates, all of which showed significantly more improvement with leflunomide than sulfasalazine at 24 months.",0.15691308677196503

Several short term randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of bariatric procedures for inducing weight loss and initial remission of type 2 diabetes. Observational studies have linked bariatric procedures with long term improvements in body weight, type 2 diabetes, survival, cardiovascular events, incident cancer, and quality of life. Perioperative mortality for the average patient is low but varies greatly across subgroups. The incidence of major complications after surgery also varies widely, and emerging data show that some procedures are associated with a greater risk of substance misuse disorders, suicide, and nutritional deficiencies. More research is needed to enable long term outcomes to be compared across various procedures and subpopulations, and to identify those most likely to benefit from surgical intervention. Given uncertainties about the balance between the risks and benefits of bariatric surgery in the long term, the decision to undergo surgery should be based on a high quality shared decision making process.",0.9988276362419128
50,2019,27899816,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,"Obesity is one of the most important public health conditions worldwide. Bariatric surgery for severe obesity is an effective treatment that results in the improvement and remission of many obesity-related comorbidities, as well as providing sustained weight loss and improvement in quality of life. Contemporary bariatric operations include Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, adjustable gastric band and the duodenal switch. The vast majority of these procedures are now performed using laparoscopic technique, the main advantages of which include rapid recovery, the reduction of postoperative pain and the reduction of wound-related complications, compared with open surgery. Contemporary bariatric surgery is now safe, with a mortality of three in 1,000 patients; however, all bariatric operations are associated with their own unique short-term and long-term nutritional and procedural-related complications. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most studied metabolic disorder associated with obesity, with data demonstrating that improvement and remission of T2DM in patients with obesity is superior after bariatric surgery compared with conventional medical therapy.

The effects of the available bariatric procedures compared with medical management and with each other are uncertain. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003 and previously updated in 2005. Objectives: To assess the effects of bariatric surgery for obesity. Search strategy: Studies were obtained from computerized searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases, supplemented with searches of reference lists and consultation with experts in obesity research. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different surgical procedures, and RCTs, controlled clinical trials and prospective cohort studies comparing surgery with non-surgical management for obesity. Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked independently by two reviewers. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. Main results: Twenty six studies were included. Three RCTs and three prospective cohort studies compared surgery with non-surgical management, and 20 RCTs compared different bariatric procedures. The risk of bias of many trials was uncertain; just five had adequate allocation concealment. A meta-analysis was not appropriate.Surgery results in greater weight loss than conventional treatment in moderate (body mass index greater than 30) as well as severe obesity. Reductions in comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, also occur. Improvements in health-related quality of life occurred after two years, but effects at ten years are less clear.Surgery is associated with complications, such as pulmonary embolism, and some postoperative deaths occurred.Five different bariatric procedures were assessed, but some comparisons were assessed by just one trial. The limited evidence suggests that weight loss following gastric bypass is greater than vertical banded gastroplasty or adjustable gastric banding, but similar to isolated sleeve gastrectomy and banded gastric bypass. Isolated sleeve gastrectomy appears to result in greater weight loss than adjustable gastric banding. Evidence comparing vertical banded gastroplasty with adjustable gastric banding is inconclusive. Data on the comparative safety of the bariatric procedures was limited.Weight loss and quality of life were similar between open and laparoscopic surgery. Conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery may occur. Authors' conclusions: Surgery is more effective than conventional management. Certain procedures produce greater weight loss, but data are limited. The evidence on safety is even less clear. Due to limited evidence and poor quality of the trials, caution is required when interpreting comparative safety and effectiveness.",0.22845689952373505

The fundamental basis for bariatric surgery for the purpose of accomplishing weight loss is the determination that severe obesity is a disease associated with multiple adverse effects on health, which can be reversed or improved by successful weight loss in patients who have been unable to sustain weight loss by nonsurgical means. An explanation of possible indications for weight loss surgery as well as specific bariatric surgical procedures is presented, along with review of the safety literature of such procedures. Procedures that are less invasive or those that involve less gastrointestinal rearrangement accomplish considerably less weight loss but have substantially lower perioperative and longer-term risk. The ultimate benefit of weight reduction relates to the reduction of the comorbidities, quality of life, and all-cause mortality. With weight loss being the underlying justification for bariatric surgery in ameliorating CVD risk, current evidence-based research is discussed concerning body fat distribution, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, inflammation, obstructive sleep apnea, and others. The rationale for bariatric surgery reducing CVD events is discussed and juxtaposed with impacts on all-cause mortalities. Given the improvement of established obesity-related CVD risk factors after weight loss, it is reasonable to expect a reduction of CVD events and related mortality after weight loss in populations with obesity.

Data sources: Seventeen electronic databases were searched [MEDLINE; EMBASE; PreMedline In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations; The Cochrane Library including the Cochrane Systematic Reviews Database, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, DARE, NHS EED and HTA databases; Web of Knowledge Science Citation Index (SCI); Web of Knowledge ISI Proceedings; PsycInfo; CRD databases; BIOSIS; and databases listing ongoing clinical trials] from inception to August 2008. Bibliographies of related papers were assessed and experts were contacted to identify additional published and unpublished references. Review methods: Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were applied to the full text using a standard form. Interventions investigated were open and laparoscopic bariatric surgical procedures in widespread current use compared with one another and with non-surgical interventions. Population comprised adult patients with body mass index (BMI) &gt; or = 30 and young obese people. Main outcomes were at least one of the following after at least 12 months follow-up: measures of weight change; quality of life (QoL); perioperative and postoperative mortality and morbidity; change in obesity-related comorbidities; cost-effectiveness. Studies eligible for inclusion in the systematic review for comparisons of Surgery versus Surgery were RCTs. For comparisons of Surgery versus Non-surgical procedures eligible studies were RCTs, controlled clinical trials and prospective cohort studies (with a control cohort). Studies eligible for inclusion in the systematic review of cost-effectiveness were full cost-effectiveness analyses, cost-utility analyses, cost-benefit analyses and cost-consequence analyses. One reviewer performed data extraction, which was checked by two reviewers independently. Two reviewers independently applied quality assessment criteria and differences in opinion were resolved at each stage. Studies were synthesised through a narrative review with full tabulation of the results of all included studies. In the economic model the analysis was developed for three patient populations, those with BMI &gt; or = 40; BMI &gt; or = 30 and 40 with Type 2 diabetes at baseline; and BMI &gt; or = 30 and 35. Models were applied with assumptions on costs and comorbidity. Results: A total of 5386 references were identified of which 26 were included in the clinical effectiveness review: three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three cohort studies compared surgery with non-surgical interventions and 20 RCTs compared different surgical procedures. Bariatric surgery was a more effective intervention for weight loss than non-surgical options. In one large cohort study weight loss was still apparent 10 years after surgery, whereas patients receiving conventional treatment had gained weight. Some measures of QoL improved after surgery, but not others. After surgery statistically fewer people had metabolic syndrome and there was higher remission of Type 2 diabetes than in non-surgical groups. In one large cohort study the incidence of three out of six comorbidities assessed 10 years after surgery was significantly reduced compared with conventional therapy. Gastric bypass (GBP) was more effective for weight loss than vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and adjustable gastric banding (AGB). Laparoscopic isolated sleeve gastrectomy (LISG) was more effective than AGB in one study. GBP and banded GBP led to similar weight loss and results for GBP versus LISG and VBG versus AGB were equivocal. All comparisons of open versus laparoscopic surgeries found similar weight losses in each group. Comorbidities after surgery improved in all groups, but with no significant differences between different surgical interventions. Adverse event reporting varied; mortality ranged from none to 10%. Adverse events from conventional therapy included intolerance to medication, acute cholecystitis and gastrointestinal problems. Major adverse events following surgery, some necessitating reoperation, included anastomosis leakage, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, band slippage and band erosion. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective in comparison to non-surgical treatment in the reviewed published estimates of cost-effectiveness. However, these estimates are likely to be unreliable and not generalisable because of methodological shortcomings and the modelling assumptions made. Therefore a new economic model was developed. Surgical management was more costly than non-surgical management in each of the three patient populations analysed, but gave improved outcomes. For morbid obesity, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (base case) ranged between 2000 pounds and 4000 pounds per QALY gained. They remained within the range regarded as cost-effective from an NHS decision-making perspective when assumptions for deterministic sensitivity analysis were changed. For BMI &gt; or = 30 and 40, ICERs were 18,930 pounds at two years and 1397 pounds at 20 years, and for BMI &gt; or = 30 and 35, ICERs were 60,754 pounds at two years and 12,763 pounds at 20 years. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses produced ICERs which were generally within the range considered cost-effective, particularly at the long twenty year time horizons, although for the BMI 30-35 group some ICERs were above the acceptable range. Conclusions: Bariatric surgery appears to be a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention for moderately to severely obese people compared with non-surgical interventions. Uncertainties remain and further research is required to provide detailed data on patient QoL; impact of surgeon experience on outcome; late complications leading to reoperation; duration of comorbidity remission; resource use. Good-quality RCTs will provide evidence on bariatric surgery for young people and for adults with class I or class II obesity. New research must report on the resolution and/or development of comorbidities such as Type 2 diabetes and hypertension so that the potential benefits of early intervention can be assessed.",0.5212172269821167

Objective: To compare changes in obesity-related comorbidities in patients with severe obesity (body mass index ≥40 or ≥35 and at least 1 comorbidity) undergoing bariatric surgery or specialized medical treatment. Design, setting, and participants: Cohort study with baseline data of exposures from November 2005 through July 2010 and follow-up data from 2006 until death or through December 2015 at a tertiary care outpatient center, Vestfold Hospital Trust, Norway. Consecutive treatment-seeking adult patients (n = 2109) with severe obesity assessed (221 patients excluded and 1888 patients included). Exposures: Bariatric surgery (n = 932, 92% gastric bypass) or specialized medical treatment (n = 956) including individual or group-based lifestyle intervention programs. Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes included remission and new onset of hypertension based on drugs dispensed according to the Norwegian Prescription Database. Prespecified secondary outcomes included changes in comorbidities. Adverse events included complications retrieved from the Norwegian Patient Registry and a local laboratory database. Results: Among 1888 patients included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 43.5 (12.3) years (1249 women [66%]; mean [SD] baseline BMI, 44.2 [6.1]; 100% completed follow-up at a median of 6.5 years [range, 0.2-10.1]). Surgically treated patients had a greater likelihood of remission and lesser likelihood for new onset of hypertension (remission: absolute risk [AR], 31.9% vs 12.4%); risk difference [RD], 19.5% [95% CI, 15.8%-23.2%], relative risk [RR], 2.1 [95% CI, 2.0-2.2]; new onset: AR, 3.5% vs 12.2%, RD, 8.7% [95% CI, 6.7%-10.7%], RR, 0.4 [95% CI, 0.3-0.5]; greater likelihood of diabetes remission: AR, 57.5% vs 14.8%; RD, 42.7% [95% CI, 35.8%-49.7%], RR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.8-5.4]; greater risk of new-onset depression: AR, 8.9% vs 6.5%; RD, 2.4% [95% CI, 1.3%-3.5%], RR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.4-1.7]; and treatment with opioids: AR, 19.4% vs 15.8%, RD, 3.6% [95% CI, 2.3%-4.9%], RR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.4]). Surgical patients had a greater risk for undergoing at least 1 additional gastrointestinal surgical procedure (AR, 31.3% vs 15.5%; RD, 15.8% [95% CI, 13.1%-18.5%]; RR, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.7-2.4]). The proportion of patients with low ferritin levels was significantly greater in the surgical group (26% vs 12%, P .001). Conclusions and relevance: Among patients with severe obesity followed up for a median of 6.5 years, bariatric surgery compared with medical treatment was associated with a clinically important increased risk for complications, as well as lower risks of obesity-related comorbidities. The risk for complications should be considered in the decision-making process.",0.2605783939361572
50,2019,31682518,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,"Objective: The development of these updated clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), The Obesity Society, American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, Obesity Medicine Association, and American Society of Anesthesiologists Boards of Directors in adherence with the AACE 2017 protocol for standardized production of CPGs, algorithms, and checklists. Methods: Each recommendation was evaluated and updated based on new evidence from 2013 to the present and subjective factors provided by experts. Results: New or updated topics in this CPG include: contextualization in an adiposity-based chronic disease complications-centric model, nuance-based and algorithm/checklist-assisted clinical decision-making about procedure selection, novel bariatric procedures, enhanced recovery after bariatric surgery protocols, and logistical concerns (including cost factors) in the current health-care arena. There are 85 numbered recommendations that have updated supporting evidence, of which 61 are revised and 12 are new. Noting that there can be multiple recommendation statements within a single numbered recommendation, there are 31 (13%) Grade A, 42 (17%) Grade B, 72 (29%) Grade C, and 101 (41%) Grade D recommendations. There are 858 citations, of which 81 (9.4%) are evidence level (EL) 1 (highest), 562 (65.5%) are EL 2, 72 (8.4%) are EL 3, and 143 (16.7%) are EL 4 (lowest).

50,2019,26811617,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,"Obesity plays relevant pathophysiological role in the development of health problems, arising as result of complex interaction of genetic, nutritional, and metabolic factors. Due to the role of adipose tissue in lipid and glucose metabolism, and low grade inflammation, it is necessary to classify obesity on the basis of body fat composition and distribution, rather than the simply increase of body weight, and the Body Mass Index. The new term of adiposopathy (''sick fat'') clearly defines the pathogenic role of adipose tissue. Four phenotypes of obese individuals have been described: (1) normal weight obese (NWO); (2) metabolically obese normal weight; (3) metabolically healthy obese; and (4) metabolically unhealthy obese or ""at risk"" obese. Moreover, sarcopenic obesity has been related to all the phenotypes. The category of normal weight lean, represented by metabolically healthy normal weight has been classified to distinguish from NWO. It is crucial to recommend a bariatric surgery taking into account adiposopathy and sick fat that occurs with the expansion of fat mass, changing the inflammatory and metabolic profile of the patient.

Environmental factors epigenetically influence somatic tissues, but the contribution of these factors to the establishment of epigenetic patterns in human gametes is unknown. Here, we hypothesized that weight loss remodels the epigenetic signature of spermatozoa in human obesity. Comprehensive profiling of the epigenome of sperm from lean and obese men showed similar histone positioning, but small non-coding RNA expression and DNA methylation patterns were markedly different. In a separate cohort of morbidly obese men, surgery-induced weight loss was associated with a dramatic remodeling of sperm DNA methylation, notably at genetic locations implicated in the central control of appetite. Our data provide evidence that the epigenome of human spermatozoa dynamically changes under environmental pressure and offers insight into how obesity may propagate metabolic dysfunction to the next generation.",0.09477250277996063

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis based on a random effects model. Data sources: Searches of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from their inception to December 2012 regardless of language or publication status. Eligibility criteria: Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials with ≥ 6 months of follow-up that included individuals with a body mass index ≥ 30, compared current bariatric surgery techniques with non-surgical treatment, and reported on body weight, cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life, or adverse events. Results: The meta-analysis included 11 studies with 796 individuals (range of mean body mass index at baseline 30-52). Individuals allocated to bariatric surgery lost more body weight (mean difference -26 kg (95% confidence interval -31 to -21)) compared with non-surgical treatment, had a higher remission rate of type 2 diabetes (relative risk 22.1 (3.2 to 154.3) in a complete case analysis; 5.3 (1.8 to 15.8) in a conservative analysis assuming diabetes remission in all non-surgically treated individuals with missing data) and metabolic syndrome (relative risk 2.4 (1.6 to 3.6) in complete case analysis; 1.5 (0.9 to 2.3) in conservative analysis), greater improvements in quality of life and reductions in medicine use (no pooled data). Plasma triglyceride concentrations decreased more (mean difference -0.7 mmol/L (-1.0 to -0.4) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations increased more (mean difference 0.21 mmol/L (0.1 to 0.3)). Changes in blood pressure and total or low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were not significantly different. There were no cardiovascular events or deaths reported after bariatric surgery. The most common adverse events after bariatric surgery were iron deficiency anaemia (15% of individuals undergoing malabsorptive bariatric surgery) and reoperations (8%). Conclusions: Compared with non-surgical treatment of obesity, bariatric surgery leads to greater body weight loss and higher remission rates of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

However, there is no consensus about the usefulness of these measures. Objectives: To study the effect of dehumidification of the home environment on asthma control. Search methods: The clinical trials registers of the Cochrane Collaboration and Cochrane Airways Group were searched. Searches were current as of March 2013. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials on the use of humidity control measures in the home environment of patients with asthma were evaluated for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted independently using a pre-designed data extraction form by two review authors. Main results: A second trial has been added for the 2013 update of this review. The original open-label trial compared an intervention consisting of mechanical ventilation heat recovery system with or without high efficiency vacuum cleaner fitted in 40 homes of patients with asthma who had positive tests for sensitivity to house dust mite. The new double-blind trial also compared a mechanical ventilation heat recovery system with a placebo machine in the homes of 120 adults with allergy to house dust mite. The new trial, which was at low risk of bias, showed no significant difference in morning peak flow (mean difference (MD) 13.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.66 to 29.84), which was the primary outcome of the trial. However, there was a statistically significant improvement in evening peak flow only (MD 24.56; 95% CI 8.97 to 40.15). There was no significant difference in quality of life, rescue medication, requirement for oral corticosteroids, visits to the GP, emergency department (ED) or hospitalisations for asthma. There was no significant difference in the house dust mite count and the antigen levels in the new trial, in contrast to the previous trial.

The aims of this study were to analyze DH tolerance in asthmatic patients, to assess the parasitological effects and to analyze the environmental effects produced by the use of these appliances in the bedrooms of asthmatic patients sensitized to house dust mites. 10 stable asthmatic patients sensitized to house dust mites were studied. DH appliances (CD-300) were installed in their bedrooms. Each patient was given symptom scoring tables and a portable peak expiratory flow (P.E.F.) during a period of 5 months, 1 month before installing the DH and 4 months afterwards. To study the parasitological efficacy of the DHs, we analyzed dust samples from the bedrooms and determined the Der p I, Der f I and Der II allergens by means of a modified ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies. Dust samples were collected before installing the DHs and after they had been working for 2 and 4 months. Dry temperature and relative humidity measurements at three time intervals (7-9, 15-17 and 22-24 h) were carried out. The 1st measurement was done prior to installation of the DHs in the patients' bedrooms and the 2nd and 3rd were achieved 2 and 4 months respectively after the installation. Statistical analysis was done by comparison of paired means. No significant differences were detected in the patients' symptoms nor in the P.E.F. measurements in the course of the study. Decreases in the house dust mite allergens were observed in 4 bedrooms. A significant decrease in relative humidity in the bedrooms of mite asthma patients after use of dehumidifier appliances was observed (p 0.01). Significant differences between the measurements of the bedrooms with and without DH were detected (p 0.01). In summary, DHs were well tolerated by stable asthmatic patients, produced a significant decrease in the relative humidity level and showed some parasitological efficacy.",0.3418077826499939

Few studies have adequately examined the potential of dehumidification in reducing HDM numbers. Objective: The study examined the effect of portable domestic dehumidifiers, and a behavioural programme to reduce humidity, on HDM counts and HDM allergen levels. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was undertaken. A total of 76 homes were allocated to three groups that received a portable domestic dehumidifier, a behavioural programme, or no intervention. Humidity, temperature, HDM counts (trap and vacuum samples), HDM allergen, and other details of the home environment were measured on four occasions over a period of 1 year. Interventions and measurements were concerned predominantly with one bedroom. Results: There was a reduction in relative humidity in the dehumidifier group, but not the behavioural group. A decline in HDM trap counts was observed for all three groups. Change scores did not indicate that the dehumidifier group had a greater decline than the other groups. A secondary analysis examining presence or absence of HDM showed a shift from households having HDM at baseline to households not having HDM in the final round for some trap measures. Change score analysis indicated that this shift was greater in the dehumidifier group compared with other groups. The dehumidifier group did not show a greater decline in HDM allergen than that seen in the other two groups. Conclusion: Neither the dehumidifier nor the behavioural intervention had a major effect on HDM counts or allergen levels. However, the study did have a number of limitations relating to size, timing of intervention, and running of the dehumidifiers. The secondary data analysis may indicate some effect of dehumidification, but clearly this effect was small.

Their geographical distribution is closely correlated to the availability of moisture. Very little work has been done on the effects of reducing humidity in the home environment in the long term, with a view to controlling dust mite populations. Two different methods which might reduce humidities to levels which could successfully reduce dust mite numbers are dehumidifiers, and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR).

However, population-based studies are scarce, and the predictors of severity have been less studied. Objectives: To determine asthma severity and severity predictors regarding age at onset. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among parents of children from 94 schools in Taiwan in 2004. Asthma severity was defined as short-acting β2-agonist (SABA), inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and health care use in the last year. Information on age at onset, demographics, heredity and home exposure was collected. Ordered logistic or logistic regression was used for determining the associations between risk factors and severity. Results: Participants aged 26-50 years were included, resulting in 21,057 (67.8%) participants. Among them, 449 reported ever having had physician-diagnosed asthma, and 381 of those subjects answered the question on age at asthma onset. The risks of rescue SABA, ICS and health care use were generally higher among late-onset (13-50 years) than early-onset (0-12 years) asthmatics. Use of SABA and health care increased from childhood-onset, adolescent- or young adult-onset to adult-onset asthma. Allergic rhinitis was positively associated with SABA use (OR, 9.08; 95% CI, 1.06-77.99) and ICS use (OR, 5.08; 95% CI, 1.47-17.52) in early-onset asthma.

Particles removed from the air are likely to include airborne allergens, so ionisers may achieve an effect by reducing the allergen load. Methods: The effect of ionisers on airborne concentrations of house dust mite allergen Der p I was investigated in a double blind, crossover, placebo controlled trial in the homes of 20 children with allergic asthma. Subjects recorded their peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) twice daily and completed a daily symptom score and treatment schedule on a diary card for two six week periods, one with an active ioniser and the other with a placed ioniser (randomly allocated) used in the living room and the bedroom. Results: Airborne Der p I concentrations fell significantly during the active period compared with the placebo period, but there was no significant change in PEFR, symptom scores, or treatment usage. There was an increase in night time cough which almost reached significance during the active period. Conclusions: This study indicates that the use of ionisers cannot be recommended in the homes of asthmatic subjects to improve their symptoms.

Most studies have focused on monitoring the symptoms and drug usage for relieving symptoms. In this study, we emphasize the need to understand how personal and environmental conditions are related to the occurrence of asthma symptoms. Methods: We designed an online health diary platform to collect personal health behaviors from children, their parents and other adults with any allergic diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and allergic conjunctivitis. The participants used mobile devices or computers to record their daily health-related activities such as sleep, exercise, diet, perception of air quality and temperature, and asthma symptoms. The participants also recorded secondhand smoke exposure and the time of activities, which were combined with ambient air quality measurements for calculating personal air pollution exposure. A generalized linear mixed model was used to estimate the effects of the factors. Results: During the study period (January 2017-June 2017, and October 2017-September 2018), 132 participants provided 25,016 diary entries, and 84 participants had experienced asthma symptoms in 1458 diary entries. The results showed some different risk factors for the minors and adults. For minors, high-intensity exercise, contact with persons with influenza-like illness (ILI) and the perception of hot temperature and bad indoor air quality were associated with the occurrence of asthma episodes. The identified risk factors for the adult participants included having dehumidifiers at home, exposure to secondhand smoke, having bad sleep quality, contact with persons with ILI, not eating fruit and seafood, perceiving cold temperature, bad quality of indoor and outdoor air, and exposure to high concentration of ozone. Conclusions: The revealed personal risk factors and perceptions of air quality and temperature may provide guidance on behavioral change for people susceptible to asthma to help control acute onset and severe exacerbation of asthma flare-ups.",0.5257550477981567

Univariate and multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between comprehensive use of ECPs and receipt of preventive asthma care, as measured by number of routine asthma visits in the prior year and physician advice to modify the environment. Overall, 17% (95% CI: 14-19%) of participants had comprehensive ECP use. The most commonly used practices were 'smoke avoidance' (85%), 'pet avoidance' (59%), and 'washing sheets in hot water' (46%). Comprehensive use of ECPs was associated with having received physician advice [odds ratio (OR) 3.1, 95% CI: 2.2-4.4] and increased asthma visits (1-2 visits: OR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.0-2.4; 3-4 visits: OR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.3-3.8; ≥5 visits: OR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.5-4.8). Only a minority of parents implement comprehensive ECPs, and receipt of preventive asthma care is associated with comprehensive use. Further research is needed to determine the factors mediating these associations in order to inform more effective asthma counseling.",0.2861182689666748
101,2021,17569792,Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,ankle brace achilles tendonitis,0.0,"Background: Previous studies have shown that eccentric training has a positive effect on chronic Achilles tendinopathy. A new strategy for the treatment of chronic Achilles tendinopathy is the AirHeel brace. Hypothesis: AirHeel brace treatment improves the clinical outcome of patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy. The combination of the AirHeel brace and an eccentric training program has a synergistic effect. Study design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: One hundred patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: (1) eccentric training, (2) AirHeel brace, and (3) combination of eccentric training and AirHeel brace. Patients were evaluated at 6, 12, and 54 weeks after the beginning of the treatment protocol with ultrasonography, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle score, and Short Form-36 (SF-36). Results: The VAS score for pain, AOFAS score, and SF-36 improved significantly in all 3 groups at all 3 follow-up examinations. At the 3 time points (6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 54 weeks) of follow-up, there was no significant difference between all 3 treatment groups. In all 3 groups, there was no significant difference in tendon thickness after treatment. Conclusions: The AirHeel brace is as effective as eccentric training in the treatment of chronic Achilles tendinopathy. There is no synergistic effect when both treatment strategies are combined. Clinical relevance: The AirHeel brace is an alternative treatment option for chronic Achilles tendinopathy.",0.22002720832824707
101,2021,32068531,Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,ankle brace achilles tendonitis,0.0,"Background: Achilles tendon rupture affects &gt; 11,000 people each year in the UK, leading to prolonged periods away from work, sports and social activities. Traditionally, the ruptured tendon is held still in a plaster cast for ≥ 8 weeks. Functional bracing is an alternative treatment that allows patients to mobilise earlier, but there is little evidence about how bracing affects patients' recovery. Objectives: To measure the Achilles Tendon Rupture Score, quality of life, complications and resource use of patients receiving non-operative treatment for an Achilles tendon rupture treated with plaster cast compared with those treated with functional bracing. Design: This was a multicentre, randomised, pragmatic, two-group superiority trial. Setting: The setting was 39 NHS hospitals. Participants: A total of 540 adult patients treated non-operatively for Achilles tendon rupture were randomised from July 2016 to May 2018. Exclusion criteria included presenting after 14 days, having had previous rupture and being unable to complete questionnaires. Interventions: A total of 266 participants had a plaster cast applied, with their toes initially pointing to the floor. The cast was changed over 8 weeks to bring the foot into a walking position. A total of 274 patients had a functional brace that facilitated immediate weight-bearing. The foot position was adjusted within the brace over the same 8-week period. Main outcome measures: Achilles Tendon Rupture Score is patient reported and assesses symptoms and physical activity related to the Achilles tendon (score 0-100, with 100 being the best possible outcome). The secondary outcomes were quality of life, complications and resource use at 8 weeks and at 3, 6 and 9 months. Results: Participants had a mean age of 48.7 years, were predominantly male (79%) and had ruptured their tendon during sports (70%). Over 93% of participants completed follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference in Achilles Tendon Rupture Score at 9 months post injury (-1.38, 95% confidence interval -4.9 to 2.1). There was a statistically significant difference in Achilles Tendon Rupture Score at 8 weeks post injury in favour of the functional brace group (5.53, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 9.1), but not at 3 or 6 months post injury. Quality of life showed the same pattern, with a statistically significant difference at 8 weeks post injury but not at later time points. Complication profiles were similar in both groups. Re-rupture of the tendon occurred 17 times in the plaster cast group and 13 times in the functional brace group. There was no difference in resource use. Conclusions: This trial provides strong evidence that early weight-bearing in a functional brace provides similar outcomes to traditional plaster casting and is safe for patients receiving non-operative treatment of Achilles tendon rupture. The probability that functional bracing is cost-effective exceeds 95% for the base-case imputed analysis, assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. On average, functional brace is associated with lower costs (-£103, 95% confidence interval -£290 to £84) and more quality-adjusted life-years (0.015, 95% confidence interval -0.0013 to 0.030) than plaster cast. Limitations: Some patients declined to participate in the trial, but only a small proportion of these declined because they had a preference for one treatment or another. Overall, 58% of eligible patients agreed to participate, so the participants are broadly representative of the population under investigation. Future work: Although the UK Study of Tendo Achilles Rehabilitation provides guidance with regard to early management, rehabilitation following Achilles tendon rupture is prolonged and further research is required to define the optimal mode of rehabilitation after the initial cast/brace has been removed.

This systematic review was conducted to review the current evidence for the effectiveness of orthotic devices for the treatment of mid-portion or insertional AT. Electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus) were searched in May 2014. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Quality Index. Where possible, effects were determined using standardised mean differences. The strength of evidence for each intervention was determined according to the quality and number of studies. Twelve studies satisfied the inclusion criteria; nine studies investigated mid-portion AT, whilst three studies did not distinguish between mid-portion and insertional pathology. Weak evidence showed that foot orthoses were equivalent to physical therapy, and equivalent to no treatment. Very weak evidence supported the use of adhesive taping alone or when combined with foot orthoses. Moderate evidence showed that the AirHeel™ brace was as effective as a calf muscle eccentric exercise programme, and weak evidence showed that this intervention was not beneficial when added to a calf muscle eccentric exercise programme. Weak evidence showed that an ankle joint dorsiflexion night splint was equally effective to a calf muscle eccentric exercise programme, and strong evidence showed that this intervention was not beneficial when added to a calf muscle eccentric exercise programme. These findings may aid clinical decision making in the context of AT, however further high-quality studies are required.",0.24925844371318817

Purpose: To compare ≥10-year outcomes of 2 postoperative regimens after Achilles tendon rupture repair: early weightbearing with early mobilization versus early weightbearing with early immobilization in tension. Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 50 patients with acute Achilles tendon ruptures were randomized postoperatively to receive either early movement of the ankle between neutral and plantar flexion in a brace for 6 weeks (group 1) or Achilles tendon immobilization in tension using a below-knee cast with the ankle in a neutral position for 6 weeks (group 2). Patients were assessed at 3, 6, and 14 months and 11 years postoperatively. Results: There were 37 patients (74%) evaluated at a mean (±SD) of 11.0 ± 0.9 years. The mean Leppilahti score was 92.9 ± 5.6 in group 1 and 93.6 ± 7.2 in group 2 (P = .68). The mean isokinetic plantar flexion peak torque deficits or average work deficits in plantar flexion showed no differences between the groups with any angular velocity. Isokinetic strength changed minimally between 1 and 11 years compared with the unaffected ankle, but a mean deficit of 5% in peak torque and mean deficit of 8% in average work were still present after 11 years. On the contrary, isometric plantar flexion strength recovered significantly, with only a 2.4% difference at 11-year follow-up. Conclusion: After the 11-year follow-up, early mobilization and immobilization in tension after Achilles rupture repair resulted in similar clinical outcomes and isokinetic strengths. Regardless of patient satisfaction with the operative treatment, calf muscle strength did not recover normally even at 11-year follow-up.",0.11994537711143494

For protection and to support the area, kendo athletes habitually use taping during practice or games. Objective: To investigate the effect of various taping techniques on injury prevention and functional performance in kendo athletes. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: 15 University Kendo Team athletes with at least 2 y kendo experience. Main outcome measures: Athletes completed 5 stepping backwards and striking cycles under 4 taping conditions: no taping, athletic taping of ankle joint (AT-Ankle), athletic taping of Achilles tendon (AT-Achilles), and Kinesio-Tex taping of Achilles tendon (KT-Achilles). Jump distance, lower limb angular motion, left foot-ground contact time, Achilles tendon force (ATF), and soleus and medial gastrocnemius muscle activities were measured. Results: Lowest peak ATF was found in AT-Achilles during heel-down phase, with statistically significant difference from KT-Achilles peak force. Significant decline of soleus muscle electromyography amplitude was also found when compared to no taping during heel-down phase and other conditions during pushing phase. Conversely, KT-Achilles showed significant decrease in foot-ground contact time compared with no taping and greater ankle range of motion than in AT-Ankle. Conclusion: To protect the Achilles tendon, AT-Achilles taping is recommended since it tends to decrease ATF. Conversely, to enhance athlete performance, we recommend KT-Achilles taping to speed up kendo striking motion. However, the Achilles tendon must withstand greatest forces concurrently. This finding implies that AT-Achilles taping can protect the injured Achilles tendon and KT-Achilles taping can enhance performance on the kendo striking motion.",0.290494829416275

Critical to this is the use of the walking orthosis, which positions the ankle in equinus to allow for early weightbearing. Our aim was to test whether 2 common orthoses achieved a satisfactory equinus position. A total of 11 sequentially treated Achilles tendon ruptures were assigned to either a fixed angle walking boot with wedges (FAWW) or an adjustable external equinus-corrected brace (EEB). The lateral radiographs of the cast immobilized tendons showed a mean tibiotalar angle (TTA) of 56° (range 54° to 57°) and a mean tibio-first metatarsal angle (1MTA) of 74° (range 62° to 85°). The FAWW resulted in a mean TTA of 28° (range 15° to 35°) and 1MTA of 37° (range 30° to 45°). The EEB resulted in a TTA of 48° (range 43° to 45°) and 1MTA of 54° (range 47° to 57°). Ankle equinus was significantly greater with the EEB than with the FAWW (p .05) and similar to that with an equinus cast. The use of wedges produced an equinus appearance through the midfoot but not at the ankle. We express caution in the use of the FAWW because it is unlikely to achieve sufficient ankle equinus to shorten the Achilles tendon.",0.11226646602153778

Design: A total of 48 matched pair tests were performed comparing the effects of shoe type (high-top vs low-top) for each shoelace configuration (tied vs untied). These were performed using the Achilles tendons of 4 human cadaver lower extremities that were instrumented with a customized load cell designed to measure tension. The lower extremity was inverted in a custom testing apparatus designed to inertially invoke dorsiflexion of the foot, putting the Achilles tendon in tension. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients: Left and right lower extremities of 2 human cadavers. Interventions: None. Independent variables were shoe type and shoelace configuration. Main outcome measures: Achilles tendon tension and dorsiflexion range of motion. Results: High-top shoes significantly reduced peak Achilles tendon tension by an average of 9.9% when compared with low-top shoes. Tied laces significantly reduced peak tension for low-top (3.7%) and high-top (12.8%) shoes when compared with untied laces. With tied laces, high-top shoes significantly reduced peak dorsiflexion angle by an average of 7.2% when compared with low-top shoes. Tied laces with high-top shoes significantly reduced peak dorsiflexion angle by an average of 4.7% when compared with untied laces. A P value of 0.05 was determined to be significant.

101,2021,16203884,Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,ankle brace achilles tendonitis,0.0,"Background: There is a lack of consensus regarding the best option for the treatment of acute Achilles tendon rupture. Treatment can be broadly classified as operative (open or percutaneous) or nonoperative (casting or functional bracing). Postoperative splinting can be performed with a rigid cast (proximal or distal to the knee) or a more mobile functional brace. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify and summarize the evidence from randomized, controlled trials on the effectiveness of different interventions for the treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures. Methods: We searched multiple databases (including EMBASE, CINAHL, and MEDLINE) as well as reference lists of articles and contacted authors. Keywords included Achilles tendon, rupture, and tendon injuries. Three reviewers extracted data and independently assessed trial quality with use of a ten-item scale. Results: Twelve trials involving 800 patients were included. There was a variable level of methodological rigor and reporting of outcomes. Open operative treatment was associated with a lower risk of rerupture compared with nonoperative treatment (relative risk, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.64). However, it was associated with a higher risk of other complications, including infection, adhesions, and disturbed skin sensibility (relative risk, 10.60; 95% confidence interval, 4.82 to 23.28). Percutaneous repair was associated with a lower complication rate compared with open operative repair (relative risk, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 7.62). Patients who had been managed with a functional brace postoperatively (allowing for early mobilization) had a lower complication rate compared with those who had been managed with a cast (relative risk, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.27 to 2.76). Because of the small number of patients involved, no definitive conclusions could be made regarding different nonoperative treatment regimens. Conclusions: Open operative treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures significantly reduces the risk of rerupture compared with nonoperative treatment, but operative treatment is associated with a significantly higher risk of other complications. Operative risks may be reduced by performing surgery percutaneously. Postoperative splinting with use of a functional brace reduces the overall complication rate.

Rigid contracture deformity leads to gait instability, pain, bracing difficulties, and ulcerations. The classic surgical approach for stroke-related contracture of the foot and ankle has been combinations of tendon lengthening, tendon transfer, osteotomy, and joint fusion procedures. Recovery after traditional foot and ankle reconstructive surgery requires a period of non-weightbearing that is not typically practical for these patients. Little focus has been given in published studies on minimally invasive soft tissue release of contracture. We present the case of a 61-year-old female with an equinovarus foot contracture deformity secondary to stroke. The patient underwent Achilles tendon lengthening, posterior tibial tendon Z lengthening, and digital flexor tenotomy of each toe with immediate weightbearing in a walking boot, followed by transition to an ankle-foot orthosis. The surgical principles and technique tips are presented to demonstrate our minimally invasive approach to release of foot and ankle contracture secondary to stroke.

103,2021,14584018,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,folic acid dementia,0.0,"Background: Folates are vitamins essential to the development of the central nervous system. Insufficient folate activity at the time of conception and early pregnancy can result in congenital neural tube defects. In adult life folate deficiency has been known for decades to produce a characteristic form of anaemia (""megaloblastic""). More recently degrees of folate inadequacy, not severe enough to produce anaemia, have been found to be associated with high blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine. Such degrees of folate inadequacy can arise because of insufficient folates in the diet or because of inefficient absorption or metabolic utilisation of folates due to genetic variations. Conventional criteria for diagnosing folate deficiency may be inadequate for identifying people capable of benefiting from dietary supplementation. High blood levels of homocysteine have been linked with the risk of arterial disease, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. There is therefore interest in whether dietary supplements of folic acid (an artificial chemical analogue of naturally occurring folates) can improve cognitive function of people at risk of cognitive decline associated with ageing or dementia, whether by affecting homocysteine metabolism or through other mechanisms. There is a risk that if folic acid is given to people who have undiagnosed deficiency of vitamin B12 it may lead to neurological damage. Vitamin B12 deficiency produces both an anaemia identical to that of folate deficiency but also causes irreversible damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems. Folic acid will correct the anaemia of vitamin B12 deficiency and so delay diagnosis but will not prevent progression to neurological damage. For this reason trials of folic acid supplements may involve simultaneous administration of vitamin B12. Apparent benefit from folic acid given in the combination would therefore need to be ""corrected"" for any effect of vitamin B12 alone. A separate Cochrane review of vitamin B12 and cognitive function is being prepared. Objectives: To examine the effects of folic acid supplementation, with or without vitamin B12, on elderly healthy and demented people, in preventing cognitive impairment or retarding its progress. Search strategy: Trials were identified from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Specialized Register Group on 9 April 2003 using the terms: folic acid, folate, vitamin B9, leucovorin, methyltetrahydrofolate, vitamin B12, cobalamin, cyanocobalamin, dementia, cognitive function, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, mixed dementia and controlled trials. MEDLINE and EMBASE (both all years) were searched for additional trials on healthy people. Selection criteria: All double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials, in which supplements of folic acid with or without vitamin B12 were compared with placebo for elderly healthy people or people with any type of dementia or cognitive impairment. Data collection and analysis: The reviewers independently applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality. One reviewer extracted and analysed the data. In comparing intervention with placebo, weighted mean differences, and standardized mean difference or odds ratios were estimated. Main results: Four randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. One trial (Bryan 2002) enrolled healthy women, and three (Fioravanti 1997; Sommer 1998; VITAL 2003) recruited people with mild to moderate cognitive impairment or dementia with or without diagnosed folate deficiency. Fioravanti 1997 enrolled people with mild to moderate cognitive impairment or dementia as judged by scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Global Deterioration Scale and with serum folate level 3ng/l. One trial (VITAL 2003) studied the effects of a combination of vitamin B12 and folic acid on patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or mixed dementia. The analysis from the included trials found no benefit from folic acid with or without vitamin B12 in comparison with placebo on any measures of cognition and mood for healthy or cognitively impaired or demented people: Folic acid effect and healthy participants: there was no benefit from of oral 750 mcg folic acid per day for five weeks compared with placebo on measures of cognition and mood of 19 healthy women aged 65 to 92. Folic acid effect and people with mild to moderate cognitive decline or dementia: there were no statistically significant results in favour of folic acid with or without vitamin B12 on any measures of cognitive function. Scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) revealed no statistically significant benefit from 2 mg per day folic acid plus 1mg vitamin B12 for 12 weeks when compared with placebo (WMD 0.39, 95% CI -0.43 to 1.21, P=0.35). Cognitive scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Scale (ADAS-Cog) showed no statistically significant benefit from 2 mg /day folic acid plus 1 mg /day vitamin B12 for 12 weeks compared with placebo (WMD 0.41, 95% -1.25 to 2.07, P=4.63). The Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADL) revealed no benefit from 2mg per day of folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12 for 12 weeks in comparison with placebo (WMD -0.57, 95%CI -1.95 to 0.81, P=0.42). None of the sub tests of the Randt Memory Test (RMT) showed statistically significant benefit from 15 mg of folic acid orally per day for 9 weeks when compared with placebo. One trial (Sommer 1998) reported a significant decline compared with placebo in two cognitive function tasks in demented patients who had received high doses of folic acid (10 mg /day) for unspecified periods. One trial (VITAL 2003) showed that 2 mg folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12 daily for 12 weeks significantly lowered serum homocysteine concentrations (P 0.0001). Reviewer's conclusions: There was no beneficial effect of 750 mcg of folic acid per day on measures of cognition or mood in older healthy women. In patients with mild to moderate cognitive decline and different forms of dementia there was no benefit from folic acid on measures of cognition or mood. Folic acid plus vitamin B12 was effective in reducing the serum homocysteine concentrations. Folic acid was well tolerated and no adverse effects were reported.

The authors report on the effects of folic acid 10 mg/day versus placebo on 11 patients (only 7 completers) with dementia and low-normal folic acid levels. This is the first study evaluating folic acid or placebo in patients with dementia. Subjects had low-normal baseline folic acid levels. The magnitude of change between baseline and second testing was not statistically significant between the 2 groups. However, there was a trend for the folate group to perform worse on two specific cognitive measures, suggesting a possible trend toward worsening of some cognitive abilities after the folic acid. The folic acid in very high doses was well tolerated. Larger studies are necessary before empirically administering folic acid to patients already suffering from dementia.",0.022684382274746895

Objective: To determine the utility of routine folic acid testing for patients with anemia or dementia/altered mental status in the era of folic acid fortification. Design: Retrospective analysis of consecutive folic acid tests performed on adults over a 4-month period; chart review of patients without anemia. Measurements and main results: Serum folic acid level, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and hematocrit. We reviewed 1,007 folic acid tests performed on 980 patients. The average age was 63.8 years, and 62% of the tests were from outpatient facilities. Only 4 (0.4%) patients had folic acid levels 3 ng/mL, while 10 (1%) patients had levels of 3-4 ng/mL (borderline). Thirty-five percent of the folic acid tests were performed on patients who were not anemic; most of these were ordered to evaluate dementia or altered mental status and folic acid level was normal in all these patients. Only 7% of the patients tested had a macrocytic anemia; these patients were more likely than those without macrocytic anemia to have low folic acid levels (2.8% vs 0.4%, p .03). Conclusion: Low serum folic acid levels were rarely detected in a series of patients being evaluated for anemia, dementia, or altered mental status. The test should be reserved for patients with macrocytic anemia and those at high risk for folic acid deficiency.",0.06933676451444626

Folic acid supplementation improves cognitive function. Folic acid enhances the plasma concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid (AA) are of benefit in dementia and Alzheimer's disease by up-regulating gene expression concerned with neurogenesis, neurotransmission and connectivity, improving endothelial nitric oxide (eNO) generation, enhancing brain acetylcholine levels, and suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. EPA, DHA, and AA also form precursors to anti-inflammatory compounds such as lipoxins, resolvins, and neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) that protect neurons from the cytotoxic action of various noxious stimuli. Furthermore, various neurotrophins and statins enhance the formation of NPD1 and thus, protect neurons from oxidative stress and prevent neuronal apoptosis Folic acid improves eNO generation, enhances plasma levels of EPA/DHA and thus, could augment the formation of NPD1. These results suggest that a combination of EPA, DHA, AA and folic acid could be of significant benefit in dementia, depression, and Alzheimer's disease and improve cognitive function.",0.5229557156562805

Both phenomena have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the effect of folic acid on AD itself is unclear. We quantified folate supplementation's effect on inflammation and cognitive function in patients with AD over the course of 6 months. Methods. Patients newly diagnosed with AD (age &gt; 60 years; n = 121; mild to severe; international criteria) and being treated with donepezil were randomly assigned into two groups with (intervention group) or without (control group) supplemental treatment with folic acid (1.25 mg/d) for 6 months. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered to all patients at baseline and follow-up, and blood samples were taken before and after treatment. We quantified serum folate, amyloid beta (Aβ), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), plasma homocysteine (Hcy), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and the mRNA levels of presenilin (PS), IL-6, and TNFα in leukocytes. Data were analyzed using a repeated-measures mixed model. Results. The mean MMSE was slightly increased in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (P 0.05). Posttreatment, plasma SAM and SAM/SAH levels were significantly higher (P 0.05), while Aβ 40, PS1-mRNA, and TNFα-mRNA levels were lower in the intervention group than in the control group (P 0.05). The Aβ 42/Aβ 40 ratio was also higher in the intervention group (P 0.05). Conclusions. Folic acid is beneficial in patients with AD.

103,2021,34122042,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,folic acid dementia,0.0,"Background: Recent studies have reported that homocysteine (Hcy) may play a vital role in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study explored the relationship between the plasma Hcy and folate levels and the risk of dementia. Methods: We searched Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science for published literature, including case-control studies and prospective cohort studies, and performed a systematic analysis. Results: The results of our meta-analysis, consisting of case-control studies, showed higher levels of Hcy and lower levels of folate in dementia, AD, and VaD patients than those in non-demented controls (for dementia: SMD = 0.812, 95% CI [0.689, 0.936], p = 0.000 for Hcy; SMD = -0.677, 95% CI [-0.828, -0.525], p = 0.000 for folate). AD patients showed significantly lower plasma Hcy levels compared to VaD patients (SMD = -0.278, 95% CI [-0.466, -0.09], p = 0.000). Subgroup analysis revealed that ethnicity, average age, and dementia type had no significant effect on this association. Furthermore, from the analysis of prospective cohort studies, we identified that elevated plasma Hcy levels were associated with an increased risk of dementia, AD, and VaD (RR dementia = 1.22, 95% CI [1.08, 1.36]; RR AD = 1.07, 95% CI [1.04, 1.11]; RR VaD = 1.13, 95% CI [1.04, 1.23]). In addition, every 5 μmol/L increase in the plasma Hcy level was associated with a 9% increased risk of dementia and a 12% increased risk of AD. Conclusion: Hcy and folic acid are potential predictors of the occurrence and development of AD. A better understanding of their function in dementia could provide evidence for clinicians to rationalize clinical intervention strategies.",0.25297990441322327
103,2021,23076510,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,folic acid dementia,0.0,"Objective: Increased serum homocysteine and low folate levels are associated with a higher rate of conversion to dementia. This study examined the influence of vitamin B12/folic acid intake on the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Participants: A community dwelling cohort of older adults (N=81) from the Vienna Transdanube aging study with MCI. Design: Prospective study with a retrospective evaluation of vitamin intake. Measurements: Laboratory measurements, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive functioning were assessed at baseline and at five-year follow-up. Results: The self-reported combined use of folic acid and vitamin B12 for more than one year was associated with a lower conversion rate to dementia. Serum levels of homocysteine and vitamin B12 as measured at baseline or at five years were not associated with conversion. Higher folate levels at baseline in females predicted a lower conversion rate to dementia. The assessment of brain morphological parameters by magnetic resonance imaging revealed higher serum folate at baseline, predicting lower medial temporal lobe atrophy and higher levels of homocysteine at baseline, predicting moderate/severe global brain atrophy at five years. Users of vitamin B12 or folate, independent of time and pattern of use, had lower grades of periventricular hyperintensities and lower grades of deep white matter lesions as compared to non-users. Conclusions: These results from a middle European study support observations on the protective ability of folate in MCI patients with respect to conversion to dementia; they also point to a participation of homocysteine metabolism on processes associated with brain atrophy.",0.1916254311800003

Despite trying to convince them that no therapy is needed, children and parents ask for advice and therapy. Is duct tape truly effective for common warts, and how is it applied? Answer Common warts (verruca vulgaris) are extremely common in children and are caused by the human papillomavirus. These benign lesions will resolve spontaneously and no therapy is recommended. Evidence for duct tape effectiveness is limited, but because this therapy is safe and well tolerated, parents can try it at home, as well as try using salicylic acid patches. With duct tape therapy, apply a small piece of duct tape directly on the wart once every 4 to 7 days; then remove the tape, clean the area with soap and water, and remove the dead skin using an emery board. Apply another piece of tape 12 hours later. Repeat this cycle for 4 to 6 weeks.",0.212641641497612

Many different topical treatments are available. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of local treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts in healthy, immunocompetent adults and children. Search methods: We updated our searches of the following databases to May 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2010), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), and CINAHL (from 1981). We searched reference lists of articles and online trials registries for ongoing trials. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of topical treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected trials and extracted data; a third author resolved any disagreements. Main results: We included 85 trials involving a total of 8815 randomised participants (26 new studies were included in this update). There was a wide range of different treatments and a variety of trial designs. Many of the studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in one or more areas of trial design.Trials of salicylic acid (SA) versus placebo showed that the former significantly increased the chance of clearance of warts at all sites (RR (risk ratio) 1.56, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.20 to 2.03). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 5.01) and feet (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.55), suggested it might be more effective for hands than feet.A meta-analysis of cryotherapy versus placebo for warts at all sites favoured neither intervention nor control (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.23). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 15.94) and feet (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.07), again suggested better outcomes for hands than feet. One trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both placebo and SA, but only for hand warts.There was no significant difference in cure rates between cryotherapy at 2-, 3-, and 4-weekly intervals.Aggressive cryotherapy appeared more effective than gentle cryotherapy (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.15), but with increased adverse effects.Meta-analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in effectiveness between cryotherapy and SA at all sites (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.71) or in subgroup analyses for hands and feet.Two trials with 328 participants showed that SA and cryotherapy combined appeared more effective than SA alone (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.43).The benefit of intralesional bleomycin remains uncertain as the evidence was inconsistent. The most informative trial with 31 participants showed no significant difference in cure rate between bleomycin and saline injections (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.78).Dinitrochlorobenzene was more than twice as effective as placebo in 2 trials with 80 participants (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.26).Two trials of clear duct tape with 193 participants demonstrated no advantage over placebo (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.05).We could not combine data from trials of the following treatments: intralesional 5-fluorouracil, topical zinc, silver nitrate (which demonstrated possible beneficial effects), topical 5-fluorouracil, pulsed dye laser, photodynamic therapy, 80% phenol, 5% imiquimod cream, intralesional antigen, and topical alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid (which showed no advantage over placebo).We did not identify any RCTs that evaluated surgery (curettage, excision), formaldehyde, podophyllotoxin, cantharidin, diphencyprone, or squaric acid dibutylester. Authors' conclusions: Data from two new trials comparing SA and cryotherapy have allowed a better appraisal of their effectiveness. The evidence remains more consistent for SA, but only shows a modest therapeutic effect. Overall, trials comparing cryotherapy with placebo showed no significant difference in effectiveness, but the same was also true for trials comparing cryotherapy with SA. Only one trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both SA and placebo, and this was only for hand warts. Adverse effects, such as pain, blistering, and scarring, were not consistently reported but are probably more common with cryotherapy.None of the other reviewed treatments appeared safer or more effective than SA and cryotherapy. Two trials of clear duct tape demonstrated no advantage over placebo.

Damage can be arrested by immersing the burn in cold water as soon as possible. The goals of care are then to remove dead tissue and protect viable tissue during healing. Very superficial burns require only application of an emollient to limit inflammation and pain and prevent desiccation. Partial-thickness burns that are clean and superficial may benefit from use of a biosynthetic bilaminar membrane dressing, which forms a skin substitute while protecting the wound.

105,2021,17521815,Should I apply ice to a burn?,put ice on a burn,0.0,"Background: The beneficial effects of cooling a fresh burn wound were well demonstrated. However, there are still conflicting reports as to the optimum temperature of coolant, duration of application and effects in limiting tissue damage. A study was undertaken to investigate this, the importance of the temperature of, and the time period of application of the coolant. Materials and methods: Four identical deep dermal wounds were created on the back of 10 anaesthetised pigs. Each animal served as an independent experimental model. The effectiveness of cooling was monitored by measuring intradermal temperatures. The animals were divided into two groups; using ice water and tap water as the coolants. In each pig one wound was not cooled (wound 1). Three were cooled; one immediately for 30 min in group 1 and for 4 h in group 2 (wound 2). The other two wounds were cooled after 30 min for 30 min and 3 h (wounds 3 and 4, respectively). Results: It was found that the temperature of the coolant was crucial. When ice water of 1-8 degrees C (group 1) was used more necrosis than in the wounds that were not cooled was seen. When tap water was used at 12-18 degrees C (group 2) it was demonstrated clinically and histologically that the cooled wounds had less necrosis than the uncooled wounds and thus healed faster. In group 2 the beneficial effects of cooling were still present when delayed for half an hour. Conclusion: First aid cooling of a burn wound with tap water is an effective method of minimising the damage sustained during a burn, and is universally and immediately available. Ice water cooling is associated with an increase in tissue damage.",0.4880850911140442
105,2021,23059135,Should I apply ice to a burn?,put ice on a burn,0.0,"Introduction: First aid treatment for thermal injuries with cold water removes heat and decreases inflammation. However, perfusion in the ischemic zone surrounding the coagulated core can be compromised by cold-induced vasoconstriction and favor burn progression. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of local warming on burn progression in the rat comb burn model. Methods: 24 male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to either no treatment (control) or application of cold (17 °C) or warm (37 °C) water applied for 20 min. Evolution of burn depth, interspace necrosis, and microcirculatory perfusion were assessed with histology, planimetry, respectively with Laser Doppler flowmetry after 1 h, as well as 1, 4, and 7 days. Results: Consistent conversion from a superficial to a deep dermal burn within 24 h was obtained in control animals. Warm and cold water significantly delayed burn depth progression, however after 4 days the burn depth was similar in all groups. Interspace necrosis was significantly reduced by warm water treatment (62±4% vs. 69±5% (cold water) and 82±3% (control); p 0.05). This was attributed to the significantly improved perfusion after warming, which was present 1 h after burn induction and was maintained thereafter (103±4% of baseline vs. 91±3% for cold water and 80±2% for control, p 0.05). Conclusion: In order to limit damage after burn injury, burn progression has to be prevented. Besides delaying burn progression, the application of warm water provided an additional benefit by improving the microcirculatory perfusion, which translated into increased tissue survival.",0.000283321482129395

Among the 130 families, a total of 53 children (40.8%) experienced a burn event. Twenty-seven subjects (51%) had treated the burn with inappropriate remedies including yogurt, toothpaste, tomato paste, ice, raw egg whites, or sliced potato. Of the 28 subjects (52.8%) who had applied cold water to the burn site, 21 patients (39.6%) applied only cold water and 7 patients (13.2%) used another substance along with cold water. In addition, 13 subjects (24.5%) applied ice directly on the skin at the time of the burn. Excluding the subjects who had treated their burns with only cold water or with only ice, raw egg whites were the most commonly used agent, both alone (n = 3) or accompanied by cold water or ice (n = 6) in a total of 11 subjects (21%) who applied eggs. Based on these observations, it is suggested that educational programs emphasizing first-aid application of only cold water to burn injuries would be helpful in reducing morbidity and mortality rates. A nationwide educational program is needed to ensure that young burn victims receive appropriate first aid and to reduce the use of inappropriate home remedies and burn morbidity.",0.30854979157447815

The subdermal temperatures were monitored during the treatment and wounds observed and photographed weekly for 6 weeks, observing reepithelialization, wound surface area and cosmetic appearance. Tissue histology and scar tensile strength were examined 6 weeks after burn. The 2 degrees C and ice treatments decreased the subdermal temperature the fastest and lowest, however, generally the 15 and 2 degrees C treated wounds had better outcomes in terms of reepithelialization, scar histology, and scar appearance. These findings provide evidence to support the current first aid guidelines of cold tap water (approximately 15 degrees C) for 20 minutes as being beneficial in helping to heal the burn wound. Colder water at 2 degrees C is also beneficial. Ice should not be used.",0.29435622692108154

Large cylinders filled with nitrous oxide are used to fill balloons for recreational use. We present two patients with severe third-degree cold burns on their thighs after clamping a large cylinder between their legs while filling balloons. During filling, large amounts of nitrous oxide are inhaled, which causes the pain to be numbed. As nitrous oxide is discharged from the cylinder, the cylinder becomes ice cold. Due to direct contact with the icecold cylinder and numbness, third-degree frostbite wounds occur. In both cases presented, the burn wounds had to be debrided and treated with split-thickness skin transplants. Awareness is needed as at first presentation as the burns look superficial, but can rapidly develop into third-degree burn wounds.

105,2021,15353935,Should I apply ice to a burn?,put ice on a burn,0.0,"Methamphetamine production and use has increased dramatically during the past 10 years. Methamphetamine production requires combining hazardous and volatile chemicals that expose the manufacturer to burn injuries from explosions and chemical spills. We sought to review the epidemiology of burn injuries in a rural burn center secondary to the use of amphetamine or methamphetamine and/or the manufacture of methamphetamine. Review of the records of 507 patients who were admitted to our burn unit from December 1, 1998, to December 31, 2001, revealed 34 patients who were involved in the use of amphetamines or methamphetamines and/or the manufacture of methamphetamine. Thirty-one patients tested positive for either amphetamine (n = 2) or methamphetamine (n = 29) on routine admission urine drug screens. Twenty of these patients were involved in the manufacture of methamphetamines. Three additional patients were identified as methamphetamine manufacturers but tested negative for the use of methamphetamines. The mean age of the study population was 31.88 +/- 7.65 years, with a male:female ratio of 10.3:1. The average burn size was 18.86 +/- 20.72, with the majority secondary to flame (n = 26). Patient burn admission histories were vague, and the patient's involvement in the manufacture of methamphetamine was often only later confirmed by media, the fire marshal, family members, or the patient. Fifteen patients showed the usual withdrawal pattern of agitation and hypersomnolence, with seven patients requiring detoxification with benzodiazepines. Two were admitted acutely to the psychiatric ward for uncontrollable agitation. Eighteen patients were offered chemical dependency treatment, and two completed therapy. There was one mortality. The mean cost per person was US 77,580 dollars (range, US 112 dollars - US 426,386 dollars). The increasing use of and manufacture of methamphetamine presents new challenges for the burn team because these patients can become violent and frequently need assistance with detoxification. Routine drug screens are mandatory in identifying methamphetamine use to alert burn unit personnel to particular management problems and target individuals who may be receptive to drug rehabilitation.",0.3015550374984741

Cryolipolysis is a well-understood process through which the careful application of below-freezing temperatures is used to induce adipose cell death while sparing the skin, reducing body fat. This patient used dry ice in lieu of professional medical equipment, resulting in 4% total body surface area full- and partial-thickness wounds to her abdomen. Ultimately, the more superficial wounds healed with xenograft and a silver-impregnated dressing. The superior, deeper wound was excised and primarily closed with a fleur-de-lis panniculectomy. Her hospital course and recovery were uneventful. This case illustrates how online information of dubious quality can put the uneducated patient at risk of injury. Health-care professionals should be aware of the questionable resources available online, and should help patients become more discerning consumers of online information.

Setting: Academic tertiary care medical center. Patients: Total of 142 adult women undergoing laparoscopic (either conventional or robotic) hysterectomy were randomized to control (n = 69) or intervention (n = 73). Exclusion criteria included preoperative opioid use, planned intensive care unit admission or same-day discharge, an incision ≥4 cm, and regional anesthesia use. Interventions: Subjects in the intervention group had a large ice pack placed directly on the lower abdomen before leaving the operating room. The ice pack was maintained continuously for 12 hours postoperation, as desired thereafter until discharge, and continued use encouraged after discharge for up to 48 hours. Measurements and main results: Total opioids administered postoperatively, while inpatient and after dismissal, were assessed in morphine milligram equivalents. Postoperative pain, as well as analgesia acceptability and side effects, were assessed using validated measures: Brief Pain Inventory and Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score. Median morphine milligram equivalent was lower in the intervention group than the controls from inpatient stay on the floor to completion of opioid use as an outpatient (22.5 vs 26.2) but was not statistically significant (p = .79). There was no significant difference between the groups in Brief Pain Inventory assessment of postoperative pain severity (p = .80) or pain interference (p = .36) or Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score total score (p = .88). Most patients in the intervention group were very satisfied with ice pack use (n = 51, 79.7%) and very likely to recommend it to friends or family (n = 54, 83.1%). There were no adverse events related to ice pack use. Conclusion: There was no significant difference in postoperative opioid use or pain assessment with ice pack use after laparoscopic hysterectomy. However, most of the subjects expressed high satisfaction specific to ice pack use and would recommend its use to others, suggesting potential desirability as adjunct therapy in postoperative pain control.",0.23359665274620056

One hundred patients with vitiligo were treated with oral folic acid and vitamin B12 after being informed that sun exposure might enhance repigmentation. They were requested to keep a record of sun exposure in summer and UVB irradiation in winter. The minimal treatment time suggested was 3-6 months but should be longer if improvement was achieved. Clear repigmentation occurred in 52 patients, including 37 who exposed their skin to summer sun and 6 who used UVB lamps in winter. Repigmentation was most evident on sun-exposed areas, where 38% of the patients had previously noted repigmentation during summer months. Total repigmentation was seen in 6 patients. The spread of vitiligo stopped in 64% of the patients after treatment. Folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation combined with sun exposure can induce repigmentation better than either the vitamins or sun exposure alone. Treatment should continue as long as the white areas continue to repigment. Further studies are needed to determine ideal minimal dosages of vitamins and UV exposure, as well as treatment time.",0.5264583230018616

Vitamin D is an essential hormone synthesized in the skin and is responsible for skin pigmentation. Low levels of vitamin D have been observed in vitiligo patients and in patients with other autoimmune diseases. Therefore, the relationship between vitamin D and vitiligo needs to be investigated more thoroughly. We reviewed the literature to date regarding the role of vitamin D in skin pigmentation. Our review revealed that vitamin D deficiency has been identified in many conditions, including premature and dysmature birth, pigmented skin, obesity, advanced age, and malabsorption. Vitamin D increases melanogenesis and the tyrosinase content of cultured human melanocytes by its antiapoptotic effect. However, a few growth-inhibitory effects on melanocytes were also reported. Vitamin D regulates calcium and bone metabolism, controls cell proliferation and differentiation, and exerts immunoregulatory activities. Vitamin D exerts its effect via a nuclear hormone receptor for vitamin D. The topical application of vitamin D increased the number of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-positive melanocytes. The topical application of vitamin D yields significant results when used in combination with phototherapy and ultraviolet exposure to treat vitiligo in humans. Vitamin D decreases the expression of various cytokines that cause vitiligo. In conclusion, application of vitamin D might help in preventing destruction of melanocytes thus causing vitiligo and other autoimmune disorders. The association between low vitamin D levels and the occurrence of vitiligo and other forms of autoimmunity is to be further evaluated.",0.5257689356803894

Vitiligo therapy frequently poses a difficulty, which has sparked interest in alternative treatment modalities, including multivitamins and herbal supplementation. It has previously been established that nutrition plays a crucial role in developing, amplifying, or rehabilitating an array of human disorders. However, the correlation between diet diversity and immune-mediated skin diseases is still up to interpretation. Several supplements have been studied, including vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements. Most studies agree that combining vitamin B12, folic acid, and sun exposure is good for inducing repigmentation. Supplementation of zinc and phenylalanine when used in conjunction with topical steroids or UV-B (ultraviolet B) treatment shows therapeutic effects on vitiligo due to their role in the melanin synthesis pathway. Investigations conducted on herbal supplements have revealed that most of them contain antioxidants, which aid in repigmentation.

It also occurs in healthy blood relatives of patients with autoimmune diseases, suggesting it is genetically determined. Here it is proposed that this CD8+ T-cell deficiency underlies the development of chronic autoimmune diseases by impairing CD8+ T-cell control of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, with the result that EBV-infected autoreactive B cells accumulate in the target organ where they produce pathogenic autoantibodies and provide costimulatory survival signals to autoreactive T cells which would otherwise die in the target organ by activation-induced apoptosis. Autoimmunity is postulated to evolve in the following steps: (1) CD8+ T-cell deficiency, (2) primary EBV infection, (3) decreased CD8+ T-cell control of EBV, (4) increased EBV load and increased anti-EBV antibodies, (5) EBV infection in the target organ, (6) clonal expansion of EBV-infected autoreactive B cells in the target organ, (7) infiltration of autoreactive T cells into the target organ, and (8) development of ectopic lymphoid follicles in the target organ. It is also proposed that deprivation of sunlight and vitamin D at higher latitudes facilitates the development of autoimmune diseases by aggravating the CD8+ T-cell deficiency and thereby further impairing control of EBV. The hypothesis makes predictions which can be tested, including the prevention and successful treatment of chronic autoimmune diseases by controlling EBV infection.",0.22250023484230042

In recent years, significant evidence shows that vitamin D plays an important role in modulating the immune system. Vitamin D and its analogues via these mechanisms are playing an increasing role in the management of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, vitiligo, acne and rosacea. Objectives: In our study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between serum vitamin D levels in patients with rosacea and analyze the association of vitamin D with clinical features. Methods: Forty-four rosacea patients and 32 healthy control subjects were included into the study. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), calcium and intact parathyroid hormone were measured. Deficiency of vitamin D is defined as the level of 25(OH)D being less than 20 ng/ml. Results: Thirty-three female and 11 male patients were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 48.6 ± 11.5. The mean levels of vitamin D levels were found as 21.4 ± 9.9 and 17.1 ± 7.9 in patients and controls, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.04). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with rosacea was 38.6% and 28.1% in healthy controls (p = 0.34). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first study for evaluating serum vitamin D levels of patients with rosacea in the literature. Patients with rosacea have relatively high serum vitamin D levels compared to control groups. The result of our study suggests that increased vitamin D levels may lead to the development of rosacea.

The average life span of the patients with RA, revealing 65.8 years in male and 63.7 years in female, were much shorter than of general population. The causes of all deaths were investigated by ourselves and/or autopsy. The autopsy was performed in 56.6%. The most common causes of death in RA patients were infectious diseases (20.5%), respiratory diseases (16%, mainly interstitial pneumonia and chronic obstructive lung diseases), and gastrointestinal diseases (14.7% chiefly perforation or bleeding of peptic ulcer). The distribution of causes of death in RA patients was quite different from in general population. The gastrointestinal disease decreased from 20% in the early half (1975-1981) to 12.6% in the latter half (1982-1987). It seems likely that H2-receptor antagonist played a major role for preventing the death by perforation or bleeding of ulcer, because the drug has been used since 1982 in Japan. Renal insufficiency including amyloidosis increased markedly in the latter half (14.9%) compared with in the early half (6.7%).

107,2021,27115477,Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,yoga asthma,1.0,"Background: Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disorder affecting about 300 million people worldwide. As a holistic therapy, yoga has the potential to relieve both the physical and psychological suffering of people with asthma, and its popularity has expanded globally. A number of clinical trials have been carried out to evaluate the effects of yoga practice, with inconsistent results. Objectives: To assess the effects of yoga in people with asthma. Search methods: We systematically searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, and PsycINFO, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. We also searched PEDro. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP search portal. We searched all databases from their inception to 22 July 2015, and used no restriction on language of publication. We checked the reference lists of eligible studies and relevant review articles for additional studies. We attempted to contact investigators of eligible studies and experts in the field to learn of other published and unpublished studies. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared yoga with usual care (or no intervention) or sham intervention in people with asthma and reported at least one of the following outcomes: quality of life, asthma symptom score, asthma control, lung function measures, asthma medication usage, and adverse events. Data collection and analysis: We extracted bibliographic information, characteristics of participants, characteristics of interventions and controls, characteristics of methodology, and results for the outcomes of our interest from eligible studies. For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to denote the treatment effects, if the outcomes were measured by the same scale across studies. Alternatively, if the outcomes were measured by different scales across studies, we used standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI. For dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI to measure the treatment effects. We performed meta-analysis with Review Manager 5.3. We used the fixed-effect model to pool the data, unless there was substantial heterogeneity among studies, in which case we used the random-effects model instead. For outcomes inappropriate or impossible to pool quantitatively, we conducted a descriptive analysis and summarised the findings narratively. Main results: We included 15 RCTs with a total of 1048 participants. Most of the trials were conducted in India, followed by Europe and the United States. The majority of participants were adults of both sexes with mild to moderate asthma for six months to more than 23 years. Five studies included yoga breathing alone, while the other studies assessed yoga interventions that included breathing, posture, and meditation. Interventions lasted from two weeks to 54 months, for no more than six months in the majority of studies. The risk of bias was low across all domains in one study and unclear or high in at least one domain for the remainder.There was some evidence that yoga may improve quality of life (MD in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) score per item 0.57 units on a 7-point scale, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.77; 5 studies; 375 participants), improve symptoms (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.65; 3 studies; 243 participants), and reduce medication usage (RR 5.35, 95% CI 1.29 to 22.11; 2 studies) in people with asthma. The MD for AQLQ score exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.5, but whether the mean changes exceeded the MCID for asthma symptoms is uncertain due to the lack of an established MCID in the severity scores used in the included studies. The effects of yoga on change from baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (MD 0.04 litres, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.19; 7 studies; 340 participants; I(2) = 68%) were not statistically significant. Two studies indicated improved asthma control, but due to very significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 98%) we did not pool data. No serious adverse events associated with yoga were reported, but the data on this outcome was limited. Authors' conclusions: We found moderate-quality evidence that yoga probably leads to small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma. There is more uncertainty about potential adverse effects of yoga and its impact on lung function and medication usage. RCTs with a large sample size and high methodological and reporting quality are needed to confirm the effects of yoga for asthma.",0.32387036085128784

Objective: To systematically assess and meta-analyze the available data on efficacy and safety of yoga in alleviating asthma. Methods: MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, CAM-Quest, CAMbase, and IndMED were searched through January 2014. Randomized controlled trials of yoga for patients with asthma were included if they assessed asthma control, symptoms, quality of life, and/or pulmonary function. For each outcome, standardized mean differences (SMDs) or risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. Results: Fourteen randomized controlled trials with 824 patients were included. Evidence for effects of yoga compared with usual care was found for asthma control (RR, 10.64; 95% CI, 1.98 to 57.19; P = .006), asthma symptoms (SMD, -0.37; 95% CI, -0.55 to -0.19; P .001), quality of life (SMD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.33; P .001), peak expiratory flow rate (SMD, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.67; P .001), and ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (SMD, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.75; P .001); evidence for effects of yoga compared with psychological interventions was found for quality of life (SMD, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.99; P = .002) and peak expiratory flow rate (SMD, 2.87; 95% CI, 0.14 to 5.60; P = .04). No evidence for effects of yoga compared with sham yoga or breathing exercises was revealed. No effect was robust against all potential sources of bias. Yoga was not associated with serious adverse events. Conclusion: Yoga cannot be considered a routine intervention for asthmatic patients at this point. It can be considered an ancillary intervention or an alternative to breathing exercises for asthma patients interested in complementary interventions.",0.20322859287261963

A study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of this therapy as an adjunctive tool in the management of asthma in adult patients who remained symptomatic on moderate to high doses of inhaled steroids. Methods: A parallel group, double blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted. Subjects were randomly allocated to Sahaja yoga and control intervention groups. Both the yoga and the control interventions required the subjects to attend a 2 hour session once a week for 4 months. Asthma related quality of life (AQLQ, range 0-4), Profile of Mood States (POMS), level of airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (AHR), and a diary card based combined asthma score (CAS, range 0-12) reflecting symptoms, bronchodilator usage, and peak expiratory flow rates were measured at the end of the treatment period and again 2 months later. Results: Twenty one of 30 subjects randomised to the yoga intervention and 26 of 29 subjects randomised to the control group were available for assessment at the end of treatment. The improvement in AHR at the end of treatment was 1.5 doubling doses (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0 to 2.9, p=0.047) greater in the yoga intervention group than in the control group. Differences in AQLQ score (0.41, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.86) and CAS (0.9, 95% CI -0.9 to 2.7) were not significant (p&gt;0.05). The AQLQ mood subscale did improve more in the yoga group than in the control group (difference 0.63, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.20), as did the summary POMS score (difference 18.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 36.5, p=0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups at the 2 month follow up assessment.

107,2021,1971670,Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,yoga asthma,1.0,"The effects of two pranayama yoga breathing exercises on airway reactivity, airway calibre, symptom scores, and medication use in patients with mild asthma were assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. After baseline assessment over 1 week, 18 patients with mild asthma practised slow deep breathing for 15 min twice a day for two consecutive 2-week periods. During the active period, subjects were asked to breathe through a Pink City lung (PCL) exerciser--a device which imposes slowing of breathing and a 1:2 inspiration:expiration duration ratio equivalent to pranayama breathing methods; during the control period, subjects breathed through a matched placebo device.

Despite the availability of treatments and educational methods, children with asthma continue to report an impaired quality of life, including symptoms of anxiety and inability to participate in physical activity. As complementary health approaches are becoming more popular and show promise in the management of many chronic diseases, the purpose of this integrative review is to examine the state of the science regarding popular complementary health approaches- yoga and mindfulness- for children and adolescents with asthma. Eligibility criteria: A comprehensive search of five databases for peer reviewed articles was performed to identify experimental and non-experimental studies. The search for each database was performed from the inception of each to January 2020 and limited to the English language. The search included terminology that addressed the concepts of ""asthma"", ""yoga"" and ""mindfulness"". Sample: A total of eleven articles met the criteria for review from the years 1991 to 2019. Results: Nine publications focused on the use of yoga in children and adolescents with asthma and two publications focused on mindfulness in adolescents with asthma. Conclusions: Interventions involving either mindfulness or yoga may be effective in reducing stress and anxiety and improving quality of life and lung function in this population. Implications: Mindfulness intervention studies in the pediatric and adolescent asthma population are warranted as are additional studies that include the use of yoga with skills in mindfulness in order to evaluate their physiological and psychological effects.",0.6548423767089844

Method: Seven databases were searched from their inception to October 2010. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and non-randomized clinical trials (NRCTs) were considered, if they investigated any type of yoga in patients with asthma. The selection of studies, data extraction, and validation were performed independently by two reviewers. Results: Six RCTs and one NRCT met the inclusion criteria. Their methodological quality was mostly poor. Three RCTs and one NRCT suggested that yoga leads to a significantly greater reduction in spirometric measures, airway hyperresponsivity, dose of histamine needed to provoke a 20% reduction in forced expiratory volume in the first second, weekly number of asthma attacks, and need for drug treatment. Three RCTs showed no positive effects compared to various control interventions. Conclusions: The belief that yoga alleviates asthma is not supported by sound evidence.

This pilot study examined the tolerability, feasibility, acceptability and immediate effects of a mindful yoga intervention in children with severe asthma. Method: Fifteen children ages 7-11 with severe asthma participated in a single mindful yoga session, followed by semi-structured interviews with the child and caregiver. Vital signs and pulmonary function tests were collected pre- and post-intervention. Results: All children reported positive experiences and caregivers were generally supportive of their participation. One child experienced self-limited bronchoconstriction with asthma symptoms. There was no significant change in lung function or vital signs after the mindful yoga session. Discussion: Our results warrant additional larger studies to evaluate the safety and benefits of mindful yoga in children with severe asthma.",0.29332301020622253
107,2021,22434968,Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,yoga asthma,1.0,"Background: Asthma is one of the commonest respiratory diseases in Jimma area as well as a significant disease burden worldwide costing billions of dollars. Anti-asthmatic drugs that are available in the market are expensive and have adverse effects. Thus, it is wise to look for an adjunct therapy to alleviate these problems. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to see the effect of yoga on patterns of clinical features, peak expiratory flow rates and use of drugs in asthmatic patients. Methods: A preliminary controlled clinical trial study was conducted on 24 volunteer asthmatic patients who were getting support at the missionary of charity. They were grouped in yoga and control groups. An Indian yoga expert through a translator conducted the training on yogic practice, yogic posture, breath slowing technique and discussion at the end. Then, the yoga groups were supervised for four weeks taking yoga exercise daily for 50 minutes. Peak expiratory flow rate was taken using the mini Wright peak flow meter and vital signs were measured in both groups. Data were analyzed using web based Graph pad quick calcs statistical software. Results: The male to female ratio was 1:1 in both cases and control groups, 8(66.7%) were Christian and 9 (75.0%) were farmers. The yoga group showed 66.7% reduction in the use of salbutamole puff and 58.3% salbutamole tablets. There was a 10% increment in the PEFR in the yoga group while only 2% in the control group. There was statistically significant reduction in day and night asthma attacks in the yoga group. Conclusion: Yoga exercise among asthmatic patients resulted in a decreased number of day and night attacks and use of drugs. It also shows significant improvement in the peak expiratory flow rate.

Several randomized controlled trials have shown a benefit from yoga postures and breathing vs control, but the control in these cases involved no intervention other than usual care. This study advances the field by providing an active control. Objective: To determine the effectiveness and feasibility of a yoga and breath work intervention for improving clinical indices and quality of life in adults with mild-to-moderate asthma. Methods: A randomized, controlled, double-masked clinical trial was conducted between October 1, 2001, and March 31, 2003. Random assignment was made to either a 4-week yoga intervention that included postures and breath work or a stretching control condition. Outcome measures were evaluated at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks and included the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, rescue inhaler use, spirometry, symptom diaries, and health care utilization. Results: Sixty-two participants were randomized to the intervention and control groups, and 45 completed the final follow-up measures. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Significant within-group differences in postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second and morning symptom scores were apparent in both groups at 4 and 16 weeks; however, no significant differences between groups were observed on any outcome measures.

108,2021,15823688,Is starving a fever effective?,"starve a fever, feed a cold",0.0,"Anorexia is a common symptom accompanying infections, but the teleology of the phenomenon remains unexplained. We hypothesize that anorexia may represent a prehistoric behavioral adaptation to fight infection by maintaining T helper (Th)2 bias, which is particularly vital in fighting bacterial pathogens. Specifically, we propose that anorexia may avert the reduction of Th2/Th1 ratio by preventing feeding-induced neurohormonal and vagal output from the gut. Emerging evidence suggests that the vagal and neurohormonal output of the gut during feeding promotes Th1 function, which is desirable in fighting viral infections. Since fever may be an adaptation to fight bacteria and ""colds"" are generally viral in origin, the adage ""starve a fever and feed a cold"" may reflect a sensible behavioral strategy to tilt autonomic and Th balance in directions that are optimal for fighting the particular type of infection. The ability to modulate T helper balance through the neurohormonal and autonomic axis by adjusting food intake may be the mechanism behind other unexplained clinical observations such as the improved outcomes of ICU patients after enteric versus parenteric feedings. Compared to the prehistoric period when bacterial infection was commonplace, the anorexic response may be less adaptive today when viruses and cancers have become common triggers of anorexia. By promoting host anorexia, cachexia, and insomnia, cancers and viruses can deter behaviors such as digestion and sleep that would raise vagal and Th1 activity against tumors and viruses. Hydration and sleep, unexplained but widely accepted recommendations for flu patients, may also work by promoting vagal and Th1 functions. Modulating feeding, hydration, and sleep may prove beneficial in treating other conditions associated with abnormal autonomic and Th balance.",0.09001898765563965

These results indicate that the killing of Candida cells is due to direct damage to the cytoplasmic membrane. At 5 mg/ml, ibuprofen inhibited growth; however, it did not kill the yeasts and did not directly affect the cytoplasmic membrane. Evaluation of yeast metabolic vitality with the fluorescent probe FUN-1 showed that growth inhibition induced by the fungistatic drug concentration was due to metabolic alterations. The combination of ibuprofen with fluconazole resulted in synergic activity with eight of the 12 Candida strains studied, including four of the five fluconazole-resistant strains. The MICs of fluconazole for the fluconazole-resistant strains decreased 2-128-fold when the drug was associated with ibuprofen.

109,2021,29376219,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Background: This review is the third update of the Cochrane review ""Selenium for preventing cancer"". Selenium is a naturally occurring element with both nutritional and toxicological properties. Higher selenium exposure and selenium supplements have been suggested to protect against several types of cancer. Objectives: To gather and present evidence needed to address two research questions:1. What is the aetiological relationship between selenium exposure and cancer risk in humans?2. Describe the efficacy of selenium supplementation for cancer prevention in humans. Search methods: We updated electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid, 2013 to January 2017, week 4), and Embase (2013 to 2017, week 6), as well as searches of clinical trial registries. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal observational studies that enrolled adult participants. Data collection and analysis: We performed random-effects (RE) meta-analyses when two or more RCTs were available for a specific outcome. We conducted RE meta-analyses when five or more observational studies were available for a specific outcome. We assessed risk of bias in RCTs and in observational studies using Cochrane's risk assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. We considered in the primary analysis data pooled from RCTs with low risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included 83 studies in this updated review: two additional RCTs (10 in total) and a few additional trial reports for previously included studies. RCTs involved 27,232 participants allocated to either selenium supplements or placebo. For analyses of RCTs with low risk of bias, the summary risk ratio (RR) for any cancer incidence was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.10; 3 studies, 19,475 participants; high-certainty evidence). The RR for estimated cancer mortality was 1.02 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.30; 1 study, 17,444 participants). For the most frequently investigated site-specific cancers, investigators provided little evidence of any effect of selenium supplementation. Two RCTs with 19,009 participants indicated that colorectal cancer was unaffected by selenium administration (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.43), as were non-melanoma skin cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.30 to 4.42; 2 studies, 2027 participants), lung cancer (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.50; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), breast cancer (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 9.55; 1 study, 802 participants), bladder cancer (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.52; 2 studies, 19,009 participants), and prostate cancer (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 4 studies, 18,942 participants). Certainty of the evidence was high for all of these cancer sites, except for breast cancer, which was of moderate certainty owing to imprecision, and non-melanoma skin cancer, which we judged as moderate certainty owing to high heterogeneity. RCTs with low risk of bias suggested increased melanoma risk.Results for most outcomes were similar when we included all RCTs in the meta-analysis, regardless of risk of bias. Selenium supplementation did not reduce overall cancer incidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 5 studies, 21,860 participants) nor mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32; 2 studies, 18,698 participants). Summary RRs for site-specific cancers showed limited changes compared with estimates from high-quality studies alone, except for liver cancer, for which results were reversed.In the largest trial, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Trial, selenium supplementation increased risks of alopecia and dermatitis, and for participants with highest background selenium status, supplementation also increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. RCTs showed a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with supplementation. A hypothesis generated by the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial - that individuals with low blood selenium levels could reduce their risk of cancer (particularly prostate cancer) by increasing selenium intake - has not been confirmed. As RCT participants have been overwhelmingly male (88%), we could not assess the potential influence of sex or gender.We included 15 additional observational cohort studies (70 in total; over 2,360,000 participants). We found that lower cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 7 studies, 76,239 participants) and lower cancer mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.97; 7 studies, 183,863 participants) were associated with the highest category of selenium exposure compared with the lowest. Cancer incidence was lower in men (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.14, 4 studies, 29,365 men) than in women (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77, 2 studies, 18,244 women). Data show a decrease in risk of site-specific cancers for stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, bladder, and prostate cancers. However, these studies have major weaknesses due to study design, exposure misclassification, and potential unmeasured confounding due to lifestyle or nutritional factors covarying with selenium exposure beyond those taken into account in multi-variable analyses. In addition, no evidence of a dose-response relation between selenium status and cancer risk emerged. Certainty of evidence was very low for each outcome. Some studies suggested that genetic factors might modify the relation between selenium and cancer risk - an issue that merits further investigation. Authors' conclusions: Well-designed and well-conducted RCTs have shown no beneficial effect of selenium supplements in reducing cancer risk (high certainty of evidence). Some RCTs have raised concerns by reporting a higher incidence of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes in participants with selenium supplementation. No clear evidence of an influence of baseline participant selenium status on outcomes has emerged in these studies.Observational longitudinal studies have shown an inverse association between selenium exposure and risk of some cancer types, but null and direct relations have also been reported, and no systematic pattern suggesting dose-response relations has emerged. These studies suffer from limitations inherent to the observational design, including exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding.Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation prevents cancer in humans. However, more research is needed to assess whether selenium may modify the risk of cancer in individuals with a specific genetic background or nutritional status, and to investigate possible differential effects of various forms of selenium.",0.06461111456155777

Baseline eligibility included age 50 years or older (African American men) or 55 years or older (all other men), a serum prostate-specific antigen level of 4 ng/mL or less, and a digital rectal examination not suspicious for prostate cancer. Interventions: Oral selenium (200 microg/d from L-selenomethionine) and matched vitamin E placebo, vitamin E (400 IU/d of all rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) and matched selenium placebo, selenium + vitamin E, or placebo + placebo for a planned follow-up of minimum of 7 years and a maximum of 12 years. Main outcome measures: Prostate cancer and prespecified secondary outcomes, including lung, colorectal, and overall primary cancer. Results: As of October 23, 2008, median overall follow-up was 5.46 years (range, 4.17-7.33 years). Hazard ratios (99% confidence intervals [CIs]) for prostate cancer were 1.13 (99% CI, 0.95-1.35; n = 473) for vitamin E, 1.04 (99% CI, 0.87-1.24; n = 432) for selenium, and 1.05 (99% CI, 0.88-1.25; n = 437) for selenium + vitamin E vs 1.00 (n = 416) for placebo.

Design: A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cancer prevention trial. Setting: Seven dermatology clinics in the eastern United States. Patients: A total of 1312 patients (mean age, 63 years; range, 18-80 years) with a history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin were randomized from 1983 through 1991. Patients were treated for a mean (SD) of 4.5 (2.8) years and had a total follow-up of 6.4 (2.0) years. Interventions: Oral administration of 200 microg of selenium per day or placebo. Main outcome measures: The primary end points for the trial were the incidences of basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. The secondary end points, established in 1990, were all-cause mortality and total cancer mortality, total cancer incidence, and the incidences of lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Results: After a total follow-up of 8271 person-years, selenium treatment did not significantly affect the incidence of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer. There were 377 new cases of basal cell skin cancer among patients in the selenium group and 350 cases among the control group (relative risk [RR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.28), and 218 new squamous cell skin cancers in the selenium group and 190 cases among the controls (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.93-1.39). Analysis of secondary end points revealed that, compared with controls, patients treated with selenium had a nonsignificant reduction in all-cause mortality (108 deaths in the selenium group and 129 deaths in the control group [RR; 0.83; 95% CI, 0.63-1.08]) and significant reductions in total cancer mortality (29 deaths in the selenium treatment group and 57 deaths in controls [RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.80]), total cancer incidence (77 cancers in the selenium group and 119 in controls [RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47-0.85]), and incidences of lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers. Primarily because of the apparent reductions in total cancer mortality and total cancer incidence in the selenium group, the blinded phase of the trial was stopped early. No cases of selenium toxicity occurred. Conclusions: Selenium treatment did not protect against development of basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. However, results from secondary end-point analyses support the hypothesis that supplemental selenium may reduce the incidence of, and mortality from, carcinomas of several sites. These effects of selenium require confirmation in an independent trial of appropriate design before new public health recommendations regarding selenium supplementation can be made",0.07551926374435425

Despite the unsupported results of the last ""SELECT"" trial, the cancer-preventing activity of Se has been demonstrated in a majority of epidemiological studies. Moreover, recent studies suggest that Se has a potential to be used not only in cancer prevention but also in cancer treatment, where in combination with other anticancer drugs or radiation it may increase the efficacy of cancer therapy.

109,2021,16313696,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Se is an unusual trace element in having its own codon in mRNA that specifies its insertion into selenoproteins as selenocysteine (SeCys), by means of a mechanism requiring a large SeCys-insertion complex. This exacting insertion machinery for selenoprotein production has implications for the Se requirements for cancer prevention. If Se may protect against cancer, an adequate intake of Se is desirable. However, the level of intake in Europe and some parts of the world is not adequate for full expression of protective selenoproteins. The evidence for Se as a cancer preventive agent includes that from geographic, animal, prospective and intervention studies. Newly-published prospective studies on oesophageal, gastric-cardia and lung cancer have reinforced previous evidence, which is particularly strong for prostate cancer. Interventions with Se have shown benefit in reducing the risk of cancer incidence and mortality in all cancers combined, and specifically in liver, prostate, colo-rectal and lung cancers. The effect seems to be strongest in those individuals with the lowest Se status. As the level of Se that appears to be required for optimal effect is higher than that previously understood to be required to maximise the activity of selenoenzymes, the question has been raised as to whether selenoproteins are involved in the anti-cancer process. However, recent evidence showing an association between Se, reduction of DNA damage and oxidative stress together with data showing an effect of selenoprotein genotype on cancer risk implies that selenoproteins are indeed implicated. The likelihood of simultaneous and consecutive effects at different cancer stages still allows an important role for anti-cancer Se metabolites such as methyl selenol formed from gamma-glutamyl-selenomethyl-SeCys and selenomethyl-SeCys, components identified in certain plants and Se-enriched yeast that have anti-cancer effects. There is some evidence that Se may affect not only cancer risk but also progression and metastasis. Current primary and secondary prevention trials of Se are underway in the USA, including the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) relating to prostate cancer, although a large European trial is still desirable given the likelihood of a stronger effect in populations of lower Se status.",0.10625404864549637

Although results through the entire blinded period continued to show that selenium supplementation was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of basal cell carcinoma (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.94 to 1.26), selenium supplementation was associated with statistically significantly elevated risk of squamous cell carcinoma (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.51) and of total nonmelanoma skin cancer (HR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.34). Results from the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial conducted among individuals at high risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer continue to demonstrate that selenium supplementation is ineffective at preventing basal cell carcinoma and that it increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma and total nonmelanoma skin cancer.",0.048750683665275574
109,2021,16935405,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Selenium (Se) is a dietary essential trace element with important biological roles. Accumulating evidence indicates that Se compounds possess anticancer properties. Se is specifically incorporated into proteins in the form of selenocysteine and non-specifically incorporated as selenomethionine in place of methionine. The effects of Se compounds on cells are strictly compositional and concentration-dependent. At supranutritional dietary levels, Se can prevent the development of many types of cancer. At higher concentrations, Se compounds can be either cytotoxic or possibly carcinogenic. The cytotoxicity of Se is suggested to be associated with oxidative stress. Accordingly, sodium selenite, an inorganic Se compound, was reported to induce DNA damage, particularly DNA strand breaks and base damage. In this review we summarize the various activities of Se compounds and focus on their relation to DNA damage and repair. We discuss the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for identification of the genes involved in Se toxicity and resistance.",0.11749473959207535
109,2021,29054414,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"The relation between selenium and cancer has been one of the most hotly debated topics in human health over the last decades. Early observational studies reported an inverse relation between selenium exposure and cancer risk. Subsequently, randomized controlled trials showed that selenium supplementation does not reduce the risk of cancer and may even increase it for some types, including advanced prostate cancer and skin cancer. An increased risk of diabetes has also been reported. These findings have been consistent in the most methodologically sound trials, suggesting that the early observational studies were misleading. Other studies have investigated selenium compounds as adjuvant therapy for cancer. Though there is currently insufficient evidence regarding the utility and safety of selenium compounds for such treatments, this issue is worthy of further investigation. The study of selenium and cancer is complicated by the existence of a diverse array of organic and inorganic selenium compounds, each with distinct biological properties, and this must be taken into consideration in the interpretation of both observational and experimental human studies.",0.029670674353837967

Methods: Data for this case (n = 1,731) and cohort (n = 3,203) analysis are from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial. Cox proportional hazard models were used to test whether baseline plasma vitamin D (25-hydroxy) concentration, adjusted for season of blood collection, was associated with the risk of total and Gleason score 2-6, 7-10, and 8-10 prostate cancer. Results: There were U-shaped associations of vitamin D with total cancer risk: compared with the first quintile, HRs were 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66-1.03; P = 0.092], 0.74 (95% CI, 0.59-0.92; P = 0.008), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.69-1.07; P = 0.181), and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.78-1.21; P = 0.823), for the second through fifth quintiles, respectively. For Gleason 7-10 cancer, corresponding HRs were 0.63 (95% CI, 0.45-0.90; P = 0.010), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.47-0.92; P = 0.016), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.56-1.10; P = 0.165), and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.63-1.22; P = 0.436). Among African American men (n = 250 cases), higher vitamin D was associated with reduced risk of Gleason 7-10 cancer only: in the a posteriori contrast of quintiles 1-2 versus 3-5, the HR was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.31-0.97; P = 0.037), with no evidence of dose-response or a U-shaped association. Conclusions: Both low and high vitamin D concentrations were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer, and more strongly for high-grade disease. Impact: The optimal range of circulating vitamin D for prostate cancer prevention may be narrow. Supplementation of men with adequate levels may be harmful.

110,2021,24782304,Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,birth control pill ovarian cysts treatment,0.0,"Background: Functional ovarian cysts are a common gynecological problem among women of reproductive age worldwide. When large, persistent, or painful, these cysts may require operations, sometimes resulting in removal of the ovary. Since early oral contraceptives were associated with a reduced incidence of functional ovarian cysts, many clinicians inferred that birth control pills could be used to treat cysts as well. This became a common clinical practice in the early 1970s. Objectives: This review examined all randomized controlled trials that studied oral contraceptives as therapy for functional ovarian cysts. Search methods: In March 2014, we searched the databases of CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, and POPLINE, as well as clinical trials databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP). We also examined the reference lists of articles. For the initial review, we wrote to authors of identified trials to seek articles we had missed. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials in any language that included oral contraceptives used for treatment and not prevention of functional ovarian cysts. Criteria for diagnosis of cysts were those used by authors of trials. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently abstracted data from the articles. One entered the data into RevMan and a second verified accuracy of data entry. For dichotomous outcomes, we computed the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference with 95% CI. Main results: We identified eight randomized controlled trials from four countries; the studies included a total of 686 women. Treatment with combined oral contraceptives did not hasten resolution of functional ovarian cysts in any trial. This held true for cysts that occurred spontaneously as well as those that developed after ovulation induction. Most cysts resolved without treatment within a few cycles; persistent cysts tended to be pathological (e.g., endometrioma or para-ovarian cyst) and not physiological. Authors' conclusions: Although widely used for treating functional ovarian cysts, combined oral contraceptives appear to be of no benefit. Watchful waiting for two or three cycles is appropriate. Should cysts persist, surgical management is often indicated.",0.08127201348543167

The health benefits are numerous and outweigh the risks of their use. Definitive evidence exists for protection against ovarian and endometrial cancers, benign breast disease, pelvic inflammatory disease requiring hospitalization, ectopic pregnancy, and iron-deficiency anemia. It has also been suggested that oral contraceptives may provide a benefit on bone mineral density, uterine fibroids, toxic shock syndrome, and colorectal cancer. Minimal supportive evidence exists for oral contraceptives protecting against the development of functional ovarian cysts and rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment of medical disorders with oral contraceptives is an ""off-label"" practice. Dysmenorrhea, irregular or excessive bleeding, acne, hirsutism, and endometriosis-associated pain are common targets for oral contraceptive therapy. Most patients are unaware of these health benefits and therapeutic uses of oral contraceptives, and they tend to overestimate their risk.

The prevalence of functional ovarian cysts is determined. In this study, 428 women, aged 14-45 years, were examined by transvaginal ultrasonography. The women were gynecologically healthy and were using either no contraception, intrauterine contraceptive devices, none of which were hormone releasing, or oral contraception (OC). Cysts were defined as cystic spaces larger than 30 mm. All women were asymptomatic and regularly menstruating.The prevalence of ovarian cysts was lower for women using OC than for women using no contraception or using intrauterine contraceptive devices. The relative risk (measured as the prevalence proportion ratio) of having an ovarian cyst when using OC was 0.22 (CI: 0.13-0.39), compared to women not using OC. No difference was found in the prevalence of ovarian cysts between women using intrauterine contraceptive devices and women using no contraception. The prevalence of ovarian cyst increased throughout the menstrual cycle in women not using OC. This relation was not found in the group of users of OC. The majority of the cysts resolved within the first few days of menstruation. Sixty-five percent of the cysts persisting after menstruation had resolved at the first control examination 3 months later, independently of use of OC. Low-dose monophasic contraceptive pills seem to have a protective effect against development of functional ovarian cysts, independent of the type of gestagen and the dose of ethinylestradiol used. Ovarian cysts resolved independently of treatment with OC. The use of intrauterine contraceptive device had no influence on the occurrence of functional ovarian cysts.",0.1434909701347351

If the ovarian cysts were still present, the women were followed for another month while on the same treatment. Results: At the first month, the remission rates of ovarian cyst were 63.6% in low-dose monophasic OC and 52.9% in expectant groups. At the second month, the cumulative remission rates increased up to 72.7% in low-dose monophasic OC and 67.6% in expectant groups.

110,2021,11917375,Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,birth control pill ovarian cysts treatment,0.0,"Most of symptomatic functional ovarian cysts (FOC) are treated by surgery. Oral contraceptives and ultrasound-guided puncture are not more efficient than expectant management for treating asymptomatic FOC in non menopausal women. The probability of a cyst being functional or benign in asymptomatic postmenopausal women is assessed by transvaginal ultrasonography, color Doppler flow imaging and CA 125 serum level measurement. Conservative management of simple cysts (anechoic, diameter 5 cm with normal Doppler and CA 125 serum level) is more reasonable and safer than surgical treatment. The use of high-dose combination oral contraceptives has a protective effect against FOC, whereas low-dose pills have little or no effect. However, low-dose oral contraceptives or progestogen-only oral contraceptives do not increase the risk of FOC. In the case of recurrent or symptomatic FOC, the advantages of using higher dose formulations have not been proved. Expectant management is as effective as oral contraceptives for the resolution of FOC induced by ovarian stimulation. Tamoxifen treatment in premenopausal breast cancer patients is associated with ovarian overstimulation and FOC formation (&gt; 35%). Co-treatment with Gn-RH agonist may be successful in this indication. Hormone replacement therapy may be associated with an increasing ovarian volume, but not with an increasing rate of FOC.

110,2021,11425842,Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,birth control pill ovarian cysts treatment,0.0,"This report addresses the balance of benefits and risks from changes in ovarian and endometrial function from hormonal contraception. The main mode of action of hormonal contraception is inhibition of ovulation, due chiefly to the dose of oestrogen in combined oral contraceptives. With 20 microg dosages of ethinyl oestradiol follicular activity is more common so that contraception depends on suppression of the LH surge or disruption of the endometrial cycle. In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) treated with oral contraceptives, cysts become smaller and in time the ovarian volume is reduced, ovarian testosterone secretion is reduced and there are potentially favourable effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Typical oral contraceptive users in the 1980s had a lower incidence of ovarian cysts, but modern oral contraceptives do not appear to affect the incidence of functional cysts or benign epithelial cysts. Moreover, randomized controlled trials indicate that oral contraception prescriptions are unlikely to prevent the development of functional cysts or to hasten their disappearance. Oral contraceptives, however, greatly reduce pelvic pain in women with symptomatic endometriosis and improve the health-related quality of life. Bleeding is a common response with all types of hormonal contraception, but current methodology is inadequate to make accurate comparisons of different products or of different phasic formulations. With continuing use, however, combined oral contraception is associated with endometrial atrophy, the biological plausibility for a reduced risk of endometrial carcinoma. With progestin-only contraception, a number of endometrial changes are considered as possible mechanisms of the associated bleeding but it remains largely unexplained. Oral contraceptives are frequently used for treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, although only one trial has been reported. Oral contraceptive use confers protection from endometrial [relative risk (RR) 0.5] and ovarian (RR 0.4) cancers and in both cases, the protection lasts for up to 2 decades after stopping use.",0.08256910741329193

Aims: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of letrozole and desogestrel in the treatment of pain symptoms related to the presence of endometriosis. Methods: This open-label prospective study included 12 women with endometriosis-related pain symptoms that were refractory to previous medical and surgical treatments. All women had previous laparoscopy documenting stage IV endometriosis. The treatment protocol included the daily oral administration of letrozole 2.5 mg (Femara), desogestrel 75 microg (Cerazette), elemental calcium 1000 mg and vitamin D 880 I.U. The scheduled treatment period was six months. Results: None of the women included in the study completed the six-month treatment because all patients developed ovarian cysts; the median length of treatment was 84 days (range, 56-112). At interruption of treatment, all women reported significant improvements in dysmenorrhoea and dyspareunia. Pain symptoms quickly recurred at three-month follow up. There were no severe adverse effects of treatment; no significant change in the mineral bone density was observed during treatment. Conclusions: The combination of letrozole and desogestrel induces a relief of pain symptoms in women with endometriosis but it causes the development of ovarian cysts.

Objective: We aimed to examine the influence of iron status on iron absorption during pregnancy by measuring supplemental iron absorption, red blood cell iron incorporation, and iron status in pregnant women. Design: Subjects were 45 pregnant Peruvian women (33+/-1 wk gestation), of whom 28 received daily prenatal supplements containing 60 mg Fe and 250 microg folate without (Fe group, n = 14) or with (Fe+Zn group, n = 14) 15 mg Zn, which were were consumed from week 10 to 24 of gestation until delivery. The remaining 17 women (control) received no prenatal supplementation. Iron status indicators and isotopes were measured in maternal blood collected 2 wk postdosing with oral (57Fe) and intravenous (58Fe) stable iron isotopes. Results: Maternal serum ferritin and folate concentrations were significantly influenced by supplementation (P 0.05). Serum iron was also significantly higher in the Fe than in the Fe+Zn (P 0.03) or control (P 0.001) groups. However, the supplemented groups had significantly lower serum zinc concentrations than the control group (8.4+/-2.3 and 10.9+/-1.8 micromol/L, respectively, P 0.01). Although percentage iron absorption was inversely related to maternal serum ferritin concentrations (P = 0.036), this effect was limited and percentage iron absorption did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusions: Because absorption of nonheme iron was not substantially greater in pregnant women with depleted iron reserves, prenatal iron supplementation is important for meeting iron requirements during pregnancy.",0.09737704694271088
111,2021,22852063,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,zinc supplements pregnancy,0.0,"Zinc plays critical roles during embryogenesis, fetal growth, and milk secretion, which increase the zinc need for pregnancy and lactation. Increased needs can be met by increasing the dietary zinc intake, along with making homeostatic adjustments in zinc utilization. Potential homeostatic adjustments include changes in circulating zinc, increased zinc absorption, decreased zinc losses, and changes in whole body zinc kinetics. Although severe zinc deficiency during pregnancy has devastating effects, systematic reviews and meta-analysis of the effect of maternal zinc supplementation on pregnancy outcomes have consistently shown a limited benefit. We hypothesize, therefore, that zinc homeostatic adjustments during pregnancy and lactation improve zinc utilization sufficiently to provide the increased zinc needs in these stages and, therefore, mitigate immediate detrimental effects due to a low zinc intake. The specific questions addressed are the following: How is zinc utilization altered during pregnancy and lactation? Are those homeostatic adjustments influenced by maternal zinc status, dietary zinc, or zinc supplementation? These questions are addressed by critically reviewing results from published human studies on zinc homeostasis during pregnancy and lactation carried out in different populations worldwide.",0.22344502806663513

Objectives: To assess the effects of zinc supplementation in pregnancy on maternal, fetal, neonatal and infant outcomes. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomised trials of zinc supplementation in pregnancy. We excluded quasi-randomised controlled trials. Data collection and analysis: Three review authors applied the study selection criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted data. When necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results: We included 21 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported in 54 papers involving over 17,000 women and their babies. One trial did not contribute data. Trials were generally at low risk of bias. Zinc supplementation resulted in a small reduction in preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.97 in 16 RCTs; 16 trials of 7637 women). This was not accompanied by a similar reduction in numbers of babies with low birthweight (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; 14 trials of 5643 women). No clear differences were seen between the zinc and no zinc groups for any of the other primary maternal or neonatal outcomes, except for induction of labour in a single trial. No differing patterns were evident in the subgroups of women with low versus normal zinc and nutrition levels or in women who complied with their treatment versus those who did not. The GRADE quality of the evidence was moderate for preterm birth, small-for-gestational age, and low birthweight, and low for stillbirth or neonatal death and birthweight. Authors' conclusions: The evidence for a 14% relative reduction in preterm birth for zinc compared with placebo was primarily represented by trials involving women of low income and this has some relevance in areas of high perinatal mortality. There was no convincing evidence that zinc supplementation during pregnancy results in other useful and important benefits.

A meta-analysis completed in 2007 showed that maternal zinc supplementation resulted in a small but significant reduction in preterm birth. The purposes of this analysis are to update that previous review and expand the scope of assessment to include maternal, infant and child health outcomes. Electronic searches were carried out to identify peer-reviewed, randomised controlled trials where daily zinc supplementation was given for at least one trimester of pregnancy. The co-authors applied the study selection criteria, assessed trial quality and abstracted data. A total of 20 independent intervention trials involving more than 11,000 births were identified. The 20 trials took place across five continents between 1977 and 2008. Most studies assessed the zinc effect against a background of other micronutrient supplements, but five were placebo-controlled trials of zinc alone. The provided dose of supplemental zinc ranged from 5 to 50 mg/day. Only the risk of preterm birth reached statistical significance (summary relative risk 0.86 [95% confidence interval 0.75, 0.99]). There was no evidence that supplemental zinc affected any parameter of foetal growth (risk of low birth weight, birth weight, length at birth or head circumference at birth). Six of the 20 trials were graded as high quality. The evidence that maternal zinc supplementation lowers the risk of preterm birth was graded low; evidence for a positive effect on other foetal outcomes was graded as very low. The effect of zinc supplementation on preterm birth, if causal, might reflect a reduction in maternal infection, a primary cause of prematurity.

To assess the above outcomes in a subgroup analysis reviewing studies performed in women who are, or are likely to be, zinc-deficient. Search methods: For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (3 July 2020), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomised trials of zinc supplementation versus no zinc supplementation or placebo administration during pregnancy, earlier than 27 weeks' gestation. We excluded quasi-randomised controlled trials.

Data collection and analysis: Three review authors applied the study selection criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted data. When necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results: For this update, we included 25 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving over 18,000 women and their babies. The overall risk of bias was low in half of the studies. The evidence suggests that zinc supplementation may result in little or no difference in reducing preterm births (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.03; 21 studies, 9851 participants; low-certainty evidence). Further, zinc supplementation may make little or no difference in reducing the risk of stillbirth (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.88; 7 studies, 3295 participants; low-certainty evidence), or perinatal deaths (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.51; 2 studies, 2489 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether zinc supplementation reduces neonatal death, because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Finally, for other birth outcomes, zinc supplementation may make little or no difference to mean birthweight (MD 13.83, 95% CI -15.81 to 43.46; 22 studies, 7977 participants; low-certainty evidence), and probably makes little or no difference in reducing the risk of low birthweight (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.13; 17 studies, 7399 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and small-for-gestational age babies when compared to placebo or no zinc supplementation (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12; 9 studies, 5330 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We did not conduct subgroup analyses, as very few studies used normal zinc populations.

There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of means of head circumference (p = 0.999), length (p = 0.848), and gestational age at birth (p = 0.057) incidences of low birth weight (p = 0.863), macrosomia (p = 0.642), and the Apgar score &gt;7 at 5 min (p = 0.999), incidences of preterm delivery (p = 0.999), pre-eclampsia (p = 0.835), premature rupture of membranes (p = 0.630), and spontaneous abortion (p = 0.772). Abruption of placenta, amnionitis, stillbirth, and intrauterine death were not observed. Conclusion: Based on our findings, 15-mg zinc supplementation daily from 16 weeks of pregnancy until delivery cannot improve pregnancy outcomes.",0.0001529582659713924

Considering magnesium as a recommended dietary supplement during pregnancy and the possible role of magnesium deficiency in COVID-19 and its complications, the current study sought to determine the effect of magnesium and magnesium-containing nutritional supplements on the immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women, as well as to observe differences in pregnancy outcomes based on the supplements taken during pregnancy. The study followed a cross-sectional design, where patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection during their pregnancy were surveyed for their preferences in nutritional supplementation and their profile compared with existing records from the institutional database. A cohort of 448 pregnant women with COVID-19 during 22 months of the pandemic was assembled, out of which 13.6% took a magnesium-only supplement, and 16.5% supplemented their diet with a combination of calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Around 60% of patients in the no-supplementation group had the SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD lower than 500 U/mL, compared with 50% in those who took magnesium-based supplements. A quantity of magnesium &amp;gt;450 mg in the taken supplements determined higher levels of antibody titers after COVID-19. Low magnesium dosage (&amp;lt;450 mg) was an independent risk factor for a weak immune response (OR-1.25, p -value = 0.003). The observed findings suggest supplementing the nutritional intake of pregnant women with magnesium-based supplements to determine higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD antibodies, although causality remains unclear.",0.23476651310920715

112,2021,23633319,Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,evening primrose oil eczema,0.0,"Background: Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition, which usually develops in early childhood. Many children outgrow this disorder as they reach secondary school age, and although It may improve with age, there is no cure. Constant itch makes life uncomfortable for those with this condition, no matter what age they are, so it may have a significant effect on a person's quality of life. Its prevalence seems to be increasing as populations move from rural locations to cities. Some people, who do not see an adequate improvement or fear side-effects of conventional medical products, try complementary alternatives to conventional treatment. This is a review of evening primrose oil (EPO) and borage oil (BO) taken orally (by mouth); these have been thought to be beneficial because of their gamma-linolenic acid content. Objectives: To assess the effects of oral evening primrose oil or borage oil for treating the symptoms of atopic eczema. Search methods: We searched the following databases up to August 2012: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), AMED (from 1985), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registers and checked the bibliographies of included studies for further references to relevant trials. We corresponded with trial investigators and pharmaceutical companies to try to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We performed a separate search for adverse effects of evening primrose oil and borage oil in November 2011. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled, parallel, or cross-over trials investigating oral intake of evening primrose oil or borage oil for eczema. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently applied eligibility criteria, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We pooled dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR), and continuous outcomes using the mean difference (MD). Where possible, we pooled study results using random-effects meta-analysis and tested statistical heterogeneity using both the Chi(²) test and the I(²) statistic test. We presented results using forest plots with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results: A total of 27 studies (1596 participants) met the inclusion criteria: 19 studies assessed evening primrose oil, and 8 studies assessed borage oil. For EPO, a meta-analysis of results from 7 studies showed that EPO failed to significantly increase improvement in global eczema symptoms as reported by participants on a visual analogue scale of 0 to 100 (MD -2.22, 95% CI -10.48 to 6.04, 176 participants, 7 trials) and a visual analogue scale of 0 to 100 for medical doctors (MD -3.26, 95% CI -6.96 to 0.45, 289 participants, 8 trials) compared to the placebo group.Treatment with BO also failed to significantly improve global eczema symptoms compared to placebo treatment as reported by both participants and medical doctors, although we could not conduct a meta-analysis as studies reported results in different ways. With regard to the risk of bias, the majority of studies were of low risk of bias; we judged 67% of the included studies as having low risk of bias for random sequence generation; 44%, for allocation concealment; 59%, for blinding; and 37%, for other biases. Implications for practice: Oral borage oil and evening primrose oil lack effect on eczema; improvement was similar to respective placebos used in trials. Oral BO and EPO are not effective treatments for eczema.In these studies, along with the placebos, EPO and BO have the same, fairly common, mild, transient adverse effects, which are mainly gastrointestinal.The short-term studies included here do not examine possible adverse effects of long-term use of EPO or BO. A case report warned that if EPO is taken for a prolonged period of time (more than one year), there is a potential risk of inflammation, thrombosis, and immunosuppression; another study found that EPO may increase bleeding for people on Coumadin® (warfarin) medication. Implications for research: Noting that the confidence intervals between active and placebo treatment are narrow, to exclude the possibility of any clinically useful difference, we concluded that further studies on EPO or BO for eczema would be hard to justify.This review does not provide information about long-term use of these products.",0.17268086969852448
112,2021,19052401,Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,evening primrose oil eczema,0.0,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing, itchy dermatosis of multifactorial origin, which commonly starts in childhood. Defective metabolism of essential fatty acids leading to relative dominance of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGF2) has been reported as an important factor in the pathogenesis of AD. Evening primrose oil (EPO) as a source of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) has been of interest in the management of AD. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of EPO in atopic dermatitis in our patients. Methods: Consecutive new out-patient department (OPD) patients of a referral hospital in Kolkata clinically diagnosed as having AD were randomly allocated to two groups. To the first group, evening primrose oil was supplied as 500-mg oval clear unmarked capsules, while placebo capsules identical in appearance and containing 300 mg of sunflower oil were given to the other group. Treatment continued for a period of 5 months. With pre-designed scoring system (based on four major parameters: extent, intensity, itching, and dryness), clinical evaluation was done at baseline and subsequent monthly visits. Data of the first 25 patients from each group who completed the 5 months of trial were compiled and analyzed. Results: At the end of the fifth month, 24 (96%) patients of EPO group and 8 (32%) patients of placebo group showed improvement. There was significant difference in outcome of treatment between two groups (P 0.00001). No significant adverse effect was reported by any patient/guardian at any point of assessment. Conclusion: Evening primrose oil is a safe and effective medicine in management of AD. However, since not all researchers across the world have found the same good result, further large trials on Indian patients are needed.",0.692807674407959
112,2021,1318129,Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,evening primrose oil eczema,0.0,"Recently a defect in the function of the enzyme delta-6-desaturase has been discussed as a major factor in the development of atopic eczema. Delta-6-desaturase is responsible for the conversion of linoleic acid to gamma linolenic acid. Several plants, including evening primrose, are known to be fairly rich in gamma linolenic acid. Hence, substitution of gamma linolenic acid in patients prone to developing atopic eczema seems like a feasible concept. During the last few years different clinical trials have been performed. Controlled trials following a parallel study design showed marked improvement in atopic eczema. Patients treated with the drug showed less inflammation, dryness, scaling and overall severity compared to controls. Although these findings have been supported by meta-analysis, there is still conflicting evidence in trials based on a crossover design alone, demonstrating a decrease in itching. At present, evening primrose oil in doses used for the treatment of atopic eczema is considered safe.

In addition, the optimal dose and duration of treatment with evening primrose oil have not yet been determined. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the dose-response treatment effects of evening primrose oil on clinical symptoms of AD and serum concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Methods: Forty AD patients were enrolled for the study and randomly divided into 2 groups: those who received evening primrose oil 160 mg daily for 8 weeks and those who received 320 mg of evening primrose oil twice daily for 8 weeks. We evaluated the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) scores of all AD patients at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 8. In addition, we measured the levels of serum fatty acids, including C16 : 0 (palmitic), C18 : 2n (linoleic), C18 : 3n (linolenic) and C20 : 4 (arachidonic acid) using gas chromatography. Results: The serum fatty acid levels C18 : 3n and C20 : 4 were higher in the 320 mg group than in the 160 mg group, with statistical significance. After evening primrose oil treatment, EASI scores were reduced in the 2 groups. The improvement in EASI scores was greater in the 320 mg group than in the 160 mg group. There were no side effects seen in either group during the study in the 2 groups. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that the 320 mg and 160 mg groups may be equally effective in treating AD patients and show dose-dependent effects on serum fatty acid levels and EASI scores.",0.33260491490364075
112,2021,24435467,Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,evening primrose oil eczema,0.0,"Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD) has been related to a deficiency of delta-6-desaturase, an enzyme responsible for the conversion of linoleic acid to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). Evening primrose oil (EPO) contains high amounts of GLA. Therefore, this study investigated whether EPO supplementation results in an increase in plasma GLA and its metabolite dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) correlating with clinical improvement of AD, assessed by the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index. Methods: The open study included 21 patients with AD. EPO (4-6 g) was administered daily for 12 weeks. Before treatment, and 4 and 12 weeks after initiation of EPO supplementation, objective SCORAD was assessed and plasma concentrations of GLA and DGLA were determined by gas chromatography. Results: A significant increase in plasma GLA and DGLA levels and a decrease in the objective SCORAD were observed 4 and 12 weeks after initiation of EPO treatment. In the per-protocol population (n = 14), a significant inverse correlation between the changes in plasma GLA levels and SCORAD was found (P = 0.008). Conclusion: The clinical disease activity under EPO treatment correlates with the individual increase in plasma GLA levels. Thus, the results of this pilot study indicate that an increase in plasma GLA might be used as predictive parameter for responsiveness of AD to EPO therapy.",0.3034113645553589
112,2021,17168667,Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,evening primrose oil eczema,0.0,"The global incidence of atopic eczema is escalating. While new treatment options are becoming available, previous treatments with certain confirmed benefits are still worth investigating as safe and effective therapies. One such treatment, Efamol evening primrose oil (EPO), was proven efficacious in a 1989 meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. A decade of further testing and subsequent independent reanalysis of 26 clinical studies including 1207 patients presented here, establishes that Efamol EPO has a simultaneous, beneficial effect on itch/pruritus, crusting, oedema and redness (erythema) that becomes apparent between 4 and 8 weeks after treatment is initiated. However, the magnitude of this effect is reduced in association with increasing frequency of potent steroid use. This and other confounding variables that are now being reported in the literature may account for historically reported inconsistent patient response. Recent research has uncovered unique complexities in fatty acid metabolism and immune response in the atopic condition beyond those previously reported and may well have identified a subcategory of non-responders and has helped established those that can consistently derive significant benefit. Further research is needed to provide a better understanding of the physiology behind this complex disorder and the beneficial role that fatty acids can play in its development and management. Conclusion: Efamol EPO has a simultaneous, beneficial effect on itch/pruritus, crusting, oedema and redness (erythema) that becomes apparent between 4 and 8 weeks after treatment is initiated.

113,2021,12571295,Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,ankle brace broken ankle,1.0,"Background: Controversy continues with regard to the optimal postoperative care after open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture. The hypothesis of this study was that postoperative treatment of an ankle fracture with a brace that allows active and passive range-of-motion exercises would improve the functional recovery of patients compared with that after conventional treatment with a cast. Thus, the purpose of this prospective, randomized study was to compare the long-term subjective, objective, and functional outcome after conventional treatment with a cast and that after use of functional bracing in the first six weeks following internal fixation of an ankle fracture. Methods: One hundred patients with an unstable and/or displaced Weber type-A or B ankle fracture were treated operatively and then were randomly allocated to two groups: immobilization in a below-the-knee cast (fifty patients) or early mobilization in a functional ankle brace (fifty patients) for the first six postoperative weeks. The follow-up examinations, which consisted of subjective and objective (clinical, radiographic, and functional) evaluations, were performed at two, six, twelve, and fifty-two weeks and at two years postoperatively. Results: There were no perioperative complications in either study group, but eight patients who were managed with a cast and thirty-three patients who were managed with a brace had postoperative complications, which were mainly related to wound-healing. Two patients in the group treated with a cast had deep-vein thrombosis. All fractures healed well in both groups. The difference between the two groups with respect to the complication rate was significant (p = 0.0005). No significant differences between the study groups were observed in the final subjective or objective (clinical) evaluation. At the two-year follow-up examination, the average score (and standard deviation) according to the ankle-rating scale of Kaikkonen et al. was 85 +/- 9 points for the group treated with a cast and 83 +/- 10 points for the group treated with a brace, and the average ankle score according to the system of Olerud and Molander was 87 +/- 8 points and 87 +/- 9 points, respectively. Conclusions: The long-term functional outcome after postoperative treatment of an ankle fracture with a cast and that after use of a functional brace are similar. Although early mobilization with use of a functional ankle brace may have some theoretical beneficial effects, the risk of postoperative wound complications associated with this treatment approach is considerably increased compared with that after conventional cast treatment. Thus, the postoperative protocol of treatment with a functional brace requires refinement before it can be generally advocated for use after operative treatment of an ankle fracture.",0.2148863971233368
113,2021,25419889,Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? ,ankle brace broken ankle,1.0,"Casting and splinting techniques for treating patients with fractures have been used for centuries. Functional bracing after ankle fracture has recently been utilized in an effort to avoid the atrophy and stiffness sometimes associated with casting; functional bracing allows for early mobilization of the ankle joint during recovery. Our review investigated the published literature comparing bracing with casting after ankle fracture. Studies examining both operatively and nonoperatively treated ankle fractures were included. There is minimal evidence supporting the use of functional bracing over cast immobilization to improve functional outcome, range of motion, swelling, or post-traumatic arthrosis after ankle fracture in the long term. The primary benefits of functional bracing are the potential to return to work earlier and bracing may facilitate activities of daily living, such as bathing and dressing. In addition, there may be a decreased patient risk of developing deep vein thrombosis due to immobilization. However, there is an increased risk of wound infection when using a brace after open reduction and internal fixation of an unstable ankle fracture.

Background: There is variation in clinical practice regarding the type of ankle support used to aid recovery after ankle fracture internal fixation surgery. Objective: To determine the immediate effects of different ankle supports commonly issued to patients 6 weeks after surgery. Methods: Participants were 18 adults, 6 weeks after internal fixation for transsyndesmotic/infrasyndesmotic fracture, in a major trauma center in the UK. Interventions were a stirrup brace and walker boot compared with Tubigrip. Outcomes were (1) step-length and single-limb support time asymmetry (percentage comparing injured and uninjured limbs), (2) step width, (3) gait velocity, and (4) pain during walking (visual analog scale, 0-100). Results: Participants (mean ± SD age, 47 ± 14 years) included 8 women and 10 men, 6 weeks after surgical internal fixation for ankle fracture. Single-limb support time asymmetry reduced by 3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0%, 6%; P = .02) in the stirrup brace and by 5% (95% CI: 2%, 7%; P = .001) in the walker boot compared with Tubigrip. Step width was 1.2 cm (95% CI: 0.6, 1.7; P .001) wider in the walker boot than in Tubigrip. Self-reported pain was lower in the walker boot (5/100) and in the stirrup brace (13/100) compared to the Tubigrip (18/100, P = .03). No significant differences were found in the effects of the supports on step-length asymmetry between the walker boot or stirrup brace and Tubigrip. Conclusion: At 6 weeks after surgical internal fixation for ankle fracture, pain and single-limb support time asymmetry over a short distance and for a short-term walk were immediately reduced with the use of a walker boot use and, to a lesser extent, a stirrup-brace compared to Tubigrip. Step width also widened in a walker boot, which may confer some additional gait stability. These results apply to immediate effects, so studies with longer-term follow-up are now indicated.

Plantiflexion follows dorsiflexion and exceeds it by an average of 5 degrees. Normal ankle motion takes place with the talus rotating on an obliquely oriented axis distal to the tips of the medial and lateral malleolus. Mortise widening of less than 1 mm accommodates the talus with the fibula apparently rotating along its vertical axis. Ankle fractures treated nonsurgically will regain functional range of motion if immobilization in equinus is avoided and early weight-bearing with early functional bracing is applied. With the aid of a functional brace, fractures treated surgically may start weight-bearing and exercise within five to seven days, provided all fracture components have been stabilized.

Complications of impaired wound healing, infection, malunion, delayed union, nonunion, and Charcot arthropathy are prevalent in this patient population. Controversy exists as to whether diabetic ankle fractures are best treated noninvasively or by open reduction and internal fixation. Patients with diabetes are at significant risk for soft-tissue complications. In addition, diabetic ankle fractures heal, but significant delays in bone healing exist. Also, Charcot ankle arthropathy occurs more commonly in patients who were initially undiagnosed and had a delay in immobilization and in patients treated nonsurgically for displaced ankle fractures. Several techniques have been described to minimize complications associated with diabetic ankle fractures (eg, rigid external fixation, use of Kirschner wires or Steinmann pins to increase rigidity). Regardless of the specifics of treatment, adherence to the basic principles of preoperative planning, meticulous soft-tissue management, and attention to stable, rigid fixation with prolonged, protected immobilization are paramount in minimizing problems and yielding good functional outcomes.",0.17955312132835388

They have an incidence of 1 in 1000 a year in children. Treatment generally involves splints and casts for minor fractures and surgical fixation with screws, plates and pins followed by immobilisation for more serious fractures. Objectives: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different interventions for treating ankle fractures in children. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (22 September 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 2 2015), MEDLINE In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations (21 September 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 2015 Week 38), CINAHL (1937 to 22 September 2015), trial registers (17 February 2015), conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions for treating ankle fractures in children. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full articles for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and collected data. We undertook no meta-analysis. Main results: We included three randomised controlled trials reporting results for 189 children, all of whom had a clinical diagnosis of a ""low risk"" ankle fracture. These were predominantly classified as undisplaced Salter-Harris type I fractures of the distal fibula. All three trials compared non-surgical management options. The three trials were at high risk of bias, primarily relating to the impracticality of blinding participants and treating clinicians to the allocated interventions.Two trials compared the Aircast Air-Stirrup ankle brace versus a rigid cast, which was a removable fibreglass posterior splint in one trial (trial A) and a below-knee fibreglass walking cast in the other trial (trial B). In trial A, both devices were removed at around two weeks. In trial B, removal of the brace was optional after five days, while the walking cast was removed after three weeks. There was low-quality evidence of clinically important differences in function scores at four weeks in favour of the brace groups of both trials. Function was measured using the Activities Scale for Kids-performance (ASKp; score range 0 to 100, higher scores mean better function) in trial A and using a modified version of the ASKp score (range 0 to 100%, higher percentages mean better function) in trial B. The results for trial A (40 participants) were median 91.9 in the brace group versus 84.2 in the splint group. The results for trial B (104 participants) were 91.3% versus 85.3%; mean difference (MD) 6.00% favouring brace (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38% to 10.62%). Trial B indicated that 5% amounted to a clinically relevant difference in the modified ASKp score. Neither trial reported on unacceptable anatomy or related outcomes or long-term follow-up. There was very low-quality evidence relating to adverse events, none of which were serious. Trial A found twice as many children with pressure-related complications in the brace group (10 of 20 versus 5 of 20). In contrast, trial B found four times as many children in the cast group had adverse outcomes assessed in terms of an unscheduled visit to a healthcare provider (4 of 54 versus 16 of 50). Both trials linked some of the adverse events in the brace group with the failure to wear a protective sock. There was very low-quality evidence indicating an earlier return to pre-injury activity in the brace groups in both trials. Trial B provided low-quality evidence that children much prefer five days or more wearing an ankle brace than three weeks immobilised in a walking ankle cast. There was moderate-quality evidence of a lack of difference between the two groups in pain at four weeks.The third trial compared the Tubigrip bandage plus crutches and advice versus a plaster of Paris walking cast for two weeks and reported results at four weeks' follow-up for 45 children with an inversion injury of the ankle. The trial found very low-quality evidence of little difference in pain and function between the two groups, measured using a non-validated pain and function score at four weeks. The trial did not report on adverse effects. There was very low-quality evidence of an earlier return to normal activities, averaging six days, in children treated with Tubigrip (mean 14.17 days for Tubigrip versus 20.19 days for cast; MD -6.02 days, 95% CI -8.92 to -3.12 days).Recent evidence from magnetic resonance imaging studies of the main category of injury evaluated in these three trials suggests that most of the injuries in these trials were sprains or bone bruises rather than fractures of the distal fibular growth plate. Authors' conclusions: There is low-quality evidence of a quicker recovery of self reported function at four weeks in children with clinically diagnosed low-risk ankle fractures who are treated with an ankle brace compared with those treated with a rigid cast, especially a non-removable walking cast. There is otherwise a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform clinical practice for children with ankle fractures. Research to identify and address priority questions on the treatment of these common fractures is needed.",0.20910543203353882

Objectives: The objective was to investigate the effects of foot orthoses with medial arch support on ankle inversion angle and plantar forces and pressures on the fifth metatarsal during landing for a basketball lay-up and during the stance phase of a shuttle run. Background: Proximal fractures of the fifth metatarsal, specifically the Jones fracture, are common in sports. Wearing foot orthoses with medial arch support could increase the ankle inversion angle and the plantar forces and pressure on the fifth metatarsal that may increase the risk for fifth metatarsal fracture, Methods and measures: Three-dimensional (3-D) videographic, force plate, and in-shoe plantar force and pressure data were collected during landing after a basketball lay-up and during the stance phase of a shuttle run with and without foot orthoses with medial arch support for 14 male subjects. Two-way ANOVAs with repeated measures were performed to compare ankle inversion angle, maximum forces, and pressure on the fifth metatarsal head and base between conditions and between tasks. Results: The maximum ankle inversion angle and maximum plantar force and pressure on the base of the fifth metatarsal during both tasks as well as the maximum plantar force and pressure on the head of the fifth metatarsal during the stance of the shuttle run were significantly increased (P or =026) when wearing foot orthoses. No significant differences were found in the maximum vertical ground reaction forces between foot orthotic conditions. Conclusion: Generic use of off-the-shelf foot orthoses with medial arch support causes increased plantar forces and pressures on the fifth metatarsal and may increase the risk for proximal fracture of the fifth metatarsal. Future studies are needed to investigate this risk, acknowledging that the differences noted in our study were small in magnitude and the foot type was not measured.",0.3230191171169281
114,2021,10417589,Can applying vitamin E cream remove skin scars?,vitamin e cream for skin scars,0.0,"Background: Vitamin E is a generic term for a group of tocol and tocotrienol derivatives. Since the discovery that vitamin E is the major lipid soluble antioxidant in skin, this substance has been tried for the treatment of almost every type of skin lesion imaginable. Anecdotal reports claim that vitamin E speeds wound healing and improves the cosmetic outcome of burns and other wounds. Many lay people use vitamin E on a regular basis to improve the outcome of scars and several physicians recommend topical vitamin E after skin surgery or resurfacing. Objective: We attempted to determine whether topically applied vitamin E has any effect on the cosmetic appearance of scars as suggested by multiple anectodal reports. Methods: Fifteen patients who had undergone skin cancer removal surgery were enrolled in the study. All wounds were primarily closed in 2 layers. After the surgery, the patients were given two ointments each labeled A or B. A was Aquaphor, a regular emollient, and the B was Aquaphor mixed with vitamin E. The scars were randomly divided into parts A and B. Patients were asked to put the A ointment on part A and the B ointment on part B twice daily for 4 weeks. The study was double blinded. The physicians and the patients independently evaluated the scars for cosmetic appearance on Weeks 1, 4, and 12. The criteria was simply to recognize which side of the scar looked better if there was any difference. The patients' and the physicians' opinions were recorded. A third blinded investigator was shown photographs of the outcomes and their opinion was also noted. Results: The results of this study show that topically applied vitamin E does not help in improving the cosmetic appearance of scars and leads to a high incidence of contact dermatitis. Conclusions: This study shows that there is no benefit to the cosmetic outcome of scars by applying vitamin E after skin surgery and that the application of topical vitamin E may actually be detrimental to the cosmetic appearance of a scar. In 90% of the cases in this study, topical vitamin E either had no effect on, or actually worsened, the cosmetic appearance of scars. Of the patients studied, 33% developed a contact dermatitis to the vitamin E. Therefore we conclude that use of topical vitamin E on surgical wounds should be discouraged.",0.1335383653640747

The nature of the medication was blinded both to the patient and to the evaluator. Patients were followed for one year. Observations were made for range of motion, scar thickness, change in graft size, and ultimate cosmetic appearance. No beneficial effect of either vitamin E or topical steroid could be demonstrated. However, adverse reactions occurred in 16.4% of patients receiving active drug, compared to 5.9% treated only with base cream. Interestingly, the grafts initially contracted and subsequently grew to be a size larger (about 20%) than the original graft by one year.

However, very little evidence exists for this ""ritual."" Objectives: This review was undertaken to critically analyze the current literature about the effect of vitamin E on treating scars. Methods: The Cochrane, Medline, and PubMed databases were searched based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). The studies and levels of recommendation were graded according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) criteria. Only prospective studies were included. Results: Only six studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these six included studies, three reported a significant improvement in the cosmetic appearance of scars when using vitamin E: one study used topical vitamin E in white children as monotherapy, and two studies used vitamin E in an adult population as combination therapy. The other three selected studies showed no significant improvement in scar appearance when using topical vitamin E as monotherapy. Two of the six included studies reported adverse events of vitamin E application: contact dermatitis and increased incidence of itching and rash. Conclusions: We conclude that there is not yet sufficient evidence that monotherapy with topical vitamin E has a significant beneficial effect on scar appearance to justify its widespread use. Further prospective studies with vitamin E monotherapy and/or combination therapy are warranted to draw better conclusions regarding the value of vitamin E in the management of scar healing.

114,2021,7591421,Can applying vitamin E cream remove skin scars?,vitamin e cream for skin scars,0.0,"Background: Trauma of various origins can induce a connective tissue disorder that leads to keloids. This condition has yet not been clearly distinguished from scars and hypertrophic scars. Only electronmicroscopic and biochemical data can help to do this. Among some more or less therapeutic approaches, the use of silicon (polydimethylsiloxane) plates, wrapped on the keloid surface, has been reported effective by some authors. These authors also demonstrated that it is not the mechanical pressure that is the mechanism of action, but a direct action on fibroblasts and a hyperhydration of subcutaneous tissue. The authors of this study conceived that the silicon plate may be able to improve the transdermal penetration of a compound such as vitamin E. This vitamin is capable of preserving some important morphologic and functional features of biological membranes by means of its phytilside chain of the molecule acting as a stabilizer of lysosomal membranes. Materials and methods: Eighty patients of both sexes, aged between 18 and 63 years, who had hypertrophic scars and keloids, were admitted to the trial. The patients were randomized to two groups in a simple-blinded study. Group A: Forty patients whose scars have been covered with silicon plates with added vitamin E. Group B: Forty patients treated with simple silicone gel sheets. No pressure bandages were used, only tape fixing the sheet for 10 hours overnight. The trial lasted for 2 months. The results were recorded at 4 and 8 weeks, evaluating the improvement according to a Scott-Husskinson scale. For objective assessment photos were taken. The results were analyzed by the chi-square test. Results: At the end of the first month, group A had improved by more than 50% in 85% of cases, whereas the improvement in group B was 55% (P 0.01). At the end of the second month, 95% of patients in group A had improved by 50%, whereas 75% had improved by 50% in group B (P 0.05).

During wound healing, abnormal scarring may occur and lead to reduced mobility, disfigurement, and psychosocial concerns. The role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and treatment of scarring has not been reviewed previously. Methods: A literature search was performed on PubMed to identify articles on vitamin D and keloid, hypertrophic, or burn scars. Results: Molecular, epidemiological, and human clinical studies are discussed. Overall, the evidence suggests lower levels of vitamin D precursors, the active metabolite, and receptor, are associated with increased risk of scar development and increased severity. Conclusions: Scars are challenging to treat, and patients are increasingly interested in non-invasive treatment options. Although few human clinical studies have been reported, vitamin D may be beneficial as an adjunct therapy to current treatment options.

Patients at high risk of keloids are usually younger than 30 years and have darker skin. Sternal skin, shoulders and upper arms, earlobes, and cheeks are most susceptible to developing keloids and hypertrophic scars. High-risk trauma includes burns, ear piercing, and any factor that prolongs wound healing. Keloid formation often can be prevented if anticipated with immediate silicone elastomer sheeting, taping to reduce skin tension, or corticosteroid injections. Once established, however, keloids are difficult to treat, with a high recurrence rate regardless of therapy. Evidence supports silicone sheeting, pressure dressings, and corticosteroid injections as first-line treatments. Cryotherapy may be useful, but should be reserved for smaller lesions. Surgical removal of keloids poses a high recurrence risk unless combined with one or several of these standard therapies. Alternative postsurgical options for refractory scars include pulsed dye laser, radiation, and possibly imiquimod cream. Intralesional verapamil, fluorouracil, bleomycin, and interferon alfa-2b injections appear to be beneficial for treatment of established keloids.

Methods: The search for clinical trials published from 1990 to 2016 was separately conducted by AvL and FR using standard search terms as well as MeSh terms on PubMed and EMBASE. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating prophylactic magnesium administration in migraineurs aged 18-65 were considered eligible. In a mutual effort, the studies found were sorted and analyzed under consideration of the guidelines for controlled trials for drugs in migraine by the International Headache Society and using predefined eligibility criteria. The resulting clinical trials were jointly analyzed by FR and AvL applying the evidence classification scheme by the American Academy of Neurology and the Cochrane bias tool to assess the evidence-base. In accordance with the guidelines for controlled trials, the number of migraine days and number of migraine attacks were chosen as primary efficacy parameters. The present review was not registered. Results: Out of 204 search results, five clinical trials fulfilling the selection procedure were found. One out of two Class I evidence trials showed a significant reduction of the number of migraine attacks compared with placebo, while two out of three Class III trials evinced a statistically significant reduction of the primary efficacy parameters compared with placebo.

Previous studies investigating the effect of intravenous and oral magnesium on acute migraine attacks and the prevention of migraine have produced equivocal findings. Objective: To evaluate the effects of intravenous magnesium on acute migraine attacks and oral magnesium supplements on migraine prophylaxis. Study design: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Electronic databases, namely EMBASE, PubMed, the Wanfang Data Chinese Database, and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database were searched from inception to February 24, 2015. Methods: This review was conducted according to the guidelines of the PRISMA. Only RCTs evaluating the effects of intravenous or oral magnesium on migraine compared with a control group were included. Results: A total of 21 studies were included. Of which, 11 studies investigated the effects of intravenous magnesium on acute migraine (948 participants) and 10 examined the effects of oral magnesium on migraine prophylaxis (789 participants). Intravenous magnesium significantly relieved acute migraine within 15 - 45 minutes, 120 minutes, and 24 hours after the initial infusion (Odd ratios [ORs] = 0.23, 0.20, and 0.25, respectively).

Design/methods: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a compound providing a daily dose of riboflavin 400 mg, magnesium 300 mg, and feverfew 100 mg. The placebo contained 25 mg riboflavin. The study included a 1-month run-in phase and 3-month trial. The protocol allowed for 120 patients to be randomized, with a preplanned interim analysis of the data after 48 patients had completed the trial. Results: Forty-nine patients completed the 3-month trial. For the primary outcome measure, a 50% or greater reduction in migraines, there was no difference between active and ""placebo"" groups, achieved by 10 (42%) and 11 (44%), respectively (P=.87). Similarly, there was no significant difference in secondary outcome measures, for active versus placebo groups, respectively: 50% or greater reduction in migraine days (33% and 40%, P=.63); or change in mean number of migraines, migraine days, migraine index, or triptan doses.

Increased tissue levels of taurine, as well as increased extracellular magnesium, could be expected to dampen neuronal hyperexcitation, counteract vasospasm, increase tolerance to focal hypoxia and stabilize platelets; taurine may also lessen sympathetic outflow. Thus it is reasonable to speculate that supplemental magnesium taurate will have preventive value in the treatment of migraine. Fish oil, owing to its platelet-stabilizing and antivasospastic actions, may also be useful in this regard, as suggested by a few clinical reports.

The proportion of patients with a reduction of at least 50% in the number of days with migraine headache was 75% (51/68) after 3 months, with a progressive increase over the period of supplementation (63.2% [43/68] after 1 month and 70.6% [48/68] after 2 months). The proportion of patients with anxiety and depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) decreased between baseline phase and third month of supplementation from 61.9% (39/63 patients with information available) to 35% (21/60) for depression and from 52.4% (33/63) to 30% (18/60) for anxiety. An improvement of quality of life (Qualité de Vie et Migraine questionnaire) was also observed. The combination was well tolerated. Conclusions: Results suggest that the proprietary supplement containing feverfew, coenzyme Q10 and magnesium assessed could be beneficial and safe for the prevention of migraine in adult patients and merits further study.

116,2021,32342452,Does exercise help manage diabetes?,exercise diabetes,1.0,"The epidemic of diabetes mellitus has already become a serious global health threat. In the past three decades, the number of people with diabetes mellitus has quadrupled globally, and diabetes mellitus is known as the ninth major cause of death in the world nowadays. The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is in coincidence with the augmentation of obesity in most developed countries as well as in developing countries. A sedentary lifestyle is well-known as one of the major reasons for the rising epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus besides the other reasons such as adopting energy-dense diets relative to the actual need for energy and population aging. Exercise as a regular physical activity at a medium to vigorous intensity is found to be an efficient influencer that would switch back most of the known type 2 diabetes mellitus factors toward healthier positions. Exercise is proven to have clinical benefits, such as improved insulin sensitivity, reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and increased peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 peak) which are definitely preventive toward diabetes. Exercise training can favorably affect glycemic parameters, the lipid profile, blood pressure, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Exercise improves blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes, reduces cardiovascular risk factors, and regulates body weight by reducing body fat percentage and enhancing lean mass. In this chapter, the effect of regular exercise on the prevention of diabetes and short-term glucose and energy metabolism will be discussed. In addition, the effect of exercise on most common complications of type 2 diabetes including cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy will be reviewed.",0.6974732875823975

Glycaemic control improves with both aerobic and resistance exercise in type 2 diabetes, but no glycaemic benefit is seen in type 1 diabetes. This probably results from glucose fluctuations commonly seen with exercise. Low and moderate intensity exercise are generally associated with a fall in blood glucose, and high intensity exercise can be associated with a rise in blood glucose. Trial evidence is suggestive of a reduction in cardiovascular risk with exercise, although evidence from prospective, randomised controlled trials is certainly not conclusive.",0.19564823806285858

High-quality studies establishing the importance of exercise and fitness in diabetes were lacking until recently, but it is now well established that participation in regular PA improves blood glucose control and can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes, along with positively affecting lipids, blood pressure, cardiovascular events, mortality, and quality of life. Structured interventions combining PA and modest weight loss have been shown to lower type 2 diabetes risk by up to 58% in high-risk populations. Most benefits of PA on diabetes management are realized through acute and chronic improvements in insulin action, accomplished with both aerobic and resistance training.

116,2021,16855995,Does exercise help manage diabetes?,exercise diabetes,1.0,"Background: Exercise is generally recommended for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, some studies evaluate an exercise intervention including diet or behaviour modification or both, and the effects of diet and exercise are not differentiated. Some exercise studies involve low participant numbers, lacking power to show significant differences which may appear in larger trials. Objectives: To assess the effects of exercise in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Search strategy: Trials were identified through the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and manual searches of bibliographies. Date of last search was March 3, 2005. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials comparing any type of well-documented aerobic, fitness or progressive resistance training exercise with no exercise in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Any information on adverse effects was collected from the trials. Main results: Fourteen randomised controlled trials comparing exercise against no exercise in type 2 diabetes were identified involving 377 participants. Trials ranged from eight weeks to twelve months duration. Compared with the control, the exercise intervention significantly improved glycaemic control as indicated by a decrease in glycated haemoglobin levels of 0.6% (-0.6 % HbA(1c), 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.9 to -0.3; P 0.05). This result is both statistically and clinically significant. There was no significant difference between groups in whole body mass, probably due to an increase in fat free mass (muscle) with exercise, as reported in one trial (6.3 kg, 95% CI 0.0 to 12.6). There was a reduction in visceral adipose tissue with exercise (-45.5 cm(2), 95% CI -63.8 to -27.3), and subcutaneous adipose tissue also decreased. No study reported adverse effects in the exercise group or diabetic complications. The exercise intervention significantly increased insulin response (131 AUC, 95% CI 20 to 242) (one trial), and decreased plasma triglycerides (-0.25 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.02). No significant difference was found between groups in quality of life (one trial), plasma cholesterol or blood pressure. Authors' conclusions: The meta-analysis shows that exercise significantly improves glycaemic control and reduces visceral adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides, but not plasma cholesterol, in people with type 2 diabetes, even without weight loss.",0.23790395259857178
116,2021,10912903,Does exercise help manage diabetes?,exercise diabetes,1.0,"Physical activity, including appropriate endurance and resistance training, is a major therapeutic modality for type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, too often physical activity is an underutilized therapy. Favorable changes in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity usually deteriorate within 72 h of the last exercise session: consequently, regular physical activity is imperative to sustain glucose-lowering effects and improved insulin sensitivity. Individuals with type 2 diabetes should strive to achieve a minimum cumulative total of 1,000 kcal x wk(-1) from physical activities. Those with type 2 diabetes generally have a lower level of fitness (VO2max) than nondiabetic individuals. and therefore exercise intensity should be at a comfortable level (RPE 10-12) in the initial periods of training and should progress cautiously as tolerance for activity improves. Resistance training has the potential to improve muscle strength and endurance, enhance flexibility and body composition, decrease risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and result in improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Modifications to exercise type and/or intensity may be necessary for those who have complications of diabetes. Individuals with type 2 diabetes may develop autonomic neuropathy, which affects the heart rate response to exercise, and as a result, ratings of perceived exertion rather than heart rate may need to be used for moderating intensity of physical activity. Although walking may be the most convenient low-impact mode, some persons, because of peripheral neuropathy and/or foot problems, may need to do non-weight-bearing activities. Outcome expectations may contribute significantly to motivation to begin and maintain an exercise program. Interventions designed to encourage adoption of an exercise regimen must be responsive to the individual's current stage of readiness and focus efforts on moving the individual through the various ""stages of change.""",0.19275270402431488

117,2021,23823502,Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,fermented milk blood pressure,0.0,"Previous studies have suggested that probiotic fermented milk may possess blood pressure (BP)-lowering properties. In the present study, we aimed to systematically examine the effect of probiotic fermented milk on BP by conducting a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. PubMed, Cochrane library and the ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched up to March 2012 to identify eligible studies.The reference lists of the obtained articles were also reviewed. Either a fixed-effects or a random-effects model was used to calculate the combined treatment effect. Meta-analysis of fourteen randomised placebo-controlled trials involving 702 participants showed that probiotic fermented milk, compared with placebo, produced a significant reduction of 3·10 mmHg (95% CI 24·64, 21·56) in systolic BP and 1·09 mmHg (95% CI 22·11, 20·06) in diastolic BP. Subgroup analyses suggested a slightly greater effect on systolic BP in hypertensive participants than in normotensive ones (23·98 v. 22·09 mmHg). Analysis of trials conducted in Japan showed a greater reduction than those conducted in European countries for both systolic BP (26·12 v. 22·08 mmHg) and diastolic BP (23·45 v. 20·52 mmHg). Some evidence of publication bias was present, but sensitivity analysis excluding small trials that reported extreme results only affected the pooled effect size minimally. In summary, the present meta-analysis suggested that probiotic fermented milk has BP-lowering effects in pre-hypertensive and hypertensive subjects.",0.20163998007774353
117,2021,12540390,Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,fermented milk blood pressure,0.0,"Background: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) plays a dual role in the regulation of hypertension: it catalyzes the production of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and it inactivates the vasodilator bradykinin. By inhibiting these processes, ACE inhibitors have antihypertensive effects. Peptides derived from milk proteins can have ACE-inhibiting properties and may thus be used as antihypertensive components. Objective: We evaluated the long-term blood pressure-lowering effect of milk fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus LBK-16H in hypertensive subjects. Design: In a randomized placebo-controlled study, 39 hypertensive patients received 150 mL/d of either L. helveticus LBK-16H fermented milk or a control product for 21 wk after a 2-wk run-in period. During the run-in period, the average baseline diastolic and systolic blood pressure values were 155 and 97 mm Hg, respectively, in the test product group and 152 and 96 mm Hg, respectively, in the control group. After the run-in period, blood pressure was measured at home on the same day every week with the use of an automatic blood pressure recorder. Results: There was a mean difference of 6.7 +/- 3.0 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (P = 0.030) and of 3.6 +/- 1.9 mm Hg (P = 0.059) in diastolic blood pressure between the test product and control groups.

In this study we evaluated the effect and safety of powdered fermented milk with L. helveticus CM4 on subjects with high-normal blood pressure or mild hypertension. Methods: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted using 40 subjects with high-normal blood pressure (HN group) and 40 subjects with mild hypertension (MH group). Each subject ingested 6 test tablets (12 g) containing powdered fermented milk with L. helveticus CM4 daily for 4 weeks (test group) or the same amount of placebo tablets for 4 weeks (placebo group). Results: During treatment, the decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the test group tended to be greater than in the placebo group for both blood pressure groups.

Dupilumab is an interleukin 4 (IL-4) receptor α-antagonist that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through blockade of the shared IL-4α subunit. Blockade of IL-4/13 is effective in reducing Th2 response. Dupilumab has recently been approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Clinical trials have shown that adults with moderate-to-severe AD who receive weekly or biweekly dupilumab injections have significantly improved clinical and patient-reported outcomes, including Eczema Area Severity Index, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis, Dermatology Life Quality Index, and itch Numeric Rating Scale scores. Concomitant use of topical corticosteroids along with dupilumab results in a greater improvement in signs and symptoms of AD than with use of dupilumab alone. Biomarker analyses show that dupilumab modulates the AD molecular signature and other Th2-associated biomarkers. Common adverse events reported in the clinical trials were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, injection site reactions, skin infections, and conjunctivitis. These were mild-to-moderate in nature, and overall rates of adverse events occurred with similar frequency between the treatment and placebo groups. There were no significant serious safety concerns identified in phase III clinical trials.

Dupilumab is used in atopic dermatitis (AD) but is not licensed for (isolated) hand eczema. In this observational prospective study we aimed to determine the response of hand eczema to dupilumab in patients with AD. Adult patients with hand eczema and AD received dupilumab s.c. at a 600 mg loading dose, followed by 300 mg every 2 weeks. Primary outcome was a minimum improvement of 75% on the Hand Eczema Severity Index after 16 weeks (HECSI-75). Secondary outcomes were severity, measured using the Photographic guide; quality of life improvement as patient-reported outcome, measured using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI); and AD severity, measured using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). Forty-seven patients were included (32 males; mean age, 45 years). HECSI-75 was achieved by 28 (60%). Mean HECSI score reduction was 49.2 points (range, 0-164; 95% within-subject confidence interval, 46.4-52.0), which was already significantly decreased after 4 weeks (P 0.001). DLQI score mean improvement was 8.8 points (standard deviation [SD], 6.0) or 70.0% decrease (SD, 26.4) (P 0.001). Eighteen patients (38%) were classified as responders on the Photographic guide. There was no difference in response between chronic fissured and recurrent vesicular clinical subtypes. Similar percentages of patients achieving EASI-75 and HECSI-75 were seen after 16 weeks.

Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib vs dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Design, setting, and participants: Heads Up was a 24-week, head-to-head, phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-controlled clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib with dupilumab among 692 adults with moderate-to-severe AD who were candidates for systemic therapy. The study was conducted from February 21, 2019, to December 9, 2020, at 129 centers located in 22 countries across Europe, North and South America, Oceania, and the Asia-Pacific region. Efficacy analyses were conducted in the intent-to-treat population. Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1 and treated with oral upadacitinib, 30 mg once daily, or subcutaneous dupilumab, 300 mg every other week. Main outcomes and measures: The primary end point was achievement of 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) at week 16. Secondary end points were percentage change from baseline in the Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (weekly average), proportion of patients achieving EASI100 and EASI90 at week 16, percentage change from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS at week 4, proportion of patients achieving EASI75 at week 2, percentage change from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS (weekly average) at week 1, and Worst Pruritus NRS (weekly average) improvement of 4 points or more at week 16. End points at week 24 included EASI75, EASI90, EASI100, and improvement of 4 points or more in Worst Pruritus NRS from baseline (weekly average). Safety was assessed as treatment-emergent adverse events in all patients receiving 1 or more dose of either drug. Results: Of 924 patients screened, 348 (183 men [52.6%]; mean [SD] age, 36.6 [14.6] years) were randomized to receive upadacitinib and 344 were randomized to receive dupilumab (194 men [56.4%]; mean [SD] age, 36.9 [14.1] years); demographic and disease characteristics were balanced among treatment groups. At week 16, 247 patients receiving upadacitinib (71.0%) and 210 patients receiving dupilumab (61.1%) achieved EASI75 (P = .006). All ranked secondary end points also demonstrated the superiority of upadacitinib vs dupilumab, including improvement in Worst Pruritus NRS as early as week 1 (mean [SE], 31.4% [1.7%] vs 8.8% [1.8%]; P .001), achievement of EASI75 as early as week 2 (152 [43.7%] vs 60 [17.4%]; P .001), and achievement of EASI100 at week 16 (97 [27.9%] vs 26 [7.6%]; P .001). Rates of serious infection, eczema herpeticum, herpes zoster, and laboratory-related adverse events were higher for patients who received upadacitinib, whereas rates of conjunctivitis and injection-site reactions were higher for patients who received dupilumab. Conclusions and relevance: During 16 weeks of treatment, upadacitinib demonstrated superior efficacy vs dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, with no new safety signals.

Objective: To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of dupilumab in patients with AD. Methods: This ongoing, multicenter, open-label extension study (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01949311"" title=""See in ClinicalTrials.gov"">NCT01949311</a>) evaluated long-term dupilumab treatment in adults who had previously participated in phase 1 through 3 clinical trials of dupilumab for AD. This analysis examined patients given 300 mg dupilumab weekly for up to 76 weeks at data cutoff (April 2016). Safety was the primary outcome; efficacy was also evaluated. Results: Of 1491 enrolled patients (1042.9 patient-years), 92.9% were receiving treatment at cutoff. The safety profile was consistent with previously reported trials (420.4 adverse events/100 patient-years and 8.5 serious adverse events/100 patient-years), with no new safety signals; common adverse events included nasopharyngitis, conjunctivitis, and injection-site reactions. Sustained improvement was seen up to 76 weeks in all efficacy outcomes, including measures of skin inflammation, pruritus, and quality of life. Limitations: Lack of control arm, limited number of patients with 76 weeks or longer of treatment (median follow-up, 24 weeks), and patients not receiving the approved dose regimen of 300 mg every 2 weeks.

A new biologic drug (dupilumab) has been approved for moderate to severe AD in adult patients. The efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in clinical trials, but these studies do not reflect conditions in daily practice and do not consider the different clinical manifestations of AD. Objectives: Analyzing the dupilumab activity in a real-world setting and comparing its efficacy on different AD phenotypes. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 221 AD patients treated with dupilumab, stratified into six clinical phenotypes: classic, generalized eczema inflammatory and lichenoid patterns, prurigo, nummular eczema, and erythroderma. At baseline and at weeks 4, 16, and 52, the disease severity was assessed through the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and the quality of life was assessed through the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire, Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (itch NRS), and Peak Sleep NRS. Results: We found a significant improvement after 16 weeks of treatment ( p 0.0001) in all six phenotypes for all the assessed scores mentioned above, persisting up to week 52. The best improvement was seen in the more severe phenotypes, particularly the erythrodermic one. Conclusions: The present study confirmed the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in the treatment of severe AD. Its strength was in the stratification of AD patients in six different phenotypes based on their clinical presentation, all of whom markedly improved in terms of both clinically evident and reported symptoms, as well as their quality of life.",0.622099757194519

Methods: In two randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials of identical design (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2), we enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease was inadequately controlled by topical treatment. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive, for 16 weeks, subcutaneous dupilumab (300 mg) or placebo weekly or the same dose of dupilumab every other week alternating with placebo. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had both a score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) on the Investigator's Global Assessment and a reduction of 2 points or more in that score from baseline at week 16. Results: We enrolled 671 patients in SOLO 1 and 708 in SOLO 2. In SOLO 1, the primary outcome occurred in 85 patients (38%) who received dupilumab every other week and in 83 (37%) who received dupilumab weekly, as compared with 23 (10%) who received placebo (P 0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). The results were similar in SOLO 2, with the primary outcome occurring in 84 patients (36%) who received dupilumab every other week and in 87 (36%) who received dupilumab weekly, as compared with 20 (8%) who received placebo (P 0.001 for both comparisons). In addition, in the two trials, an improvement from baseline to week 16 of at least 75% on the Eczema Area and Severity Index was reported in significantly more patients who received each regimen of dupilumab than in patients who received placebo (P 0.001 for all comparisons). Dupilumab was also associated with improvement in other clinical end points, including reduction in pruritus and symptoms of anxiety or depression and improvement in quality of life. Injection-site reactions and conjunctivitis were more frequent in the dupilumab groups than in the placebo groups. Conclusions: In two phase 3 trials of identical design involving patients with atopic dermatitis, dupilumab improved the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis, including pruritus, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and quality of life, as compared with placebo.

118,2021,25006719,Can dupixent treat eczema?,dupixent eczema,1.0,"Background: Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, has shown efficacy in patients with asthma and elevated eosinophil levels. The blockade by dupilumab of these key drivers of type 2 helper T-cell (Th2)-mediated inflammation could help in the treatment of related diseases, including atopic dermatitis. Methods: We performed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving adults who had moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis despite treatment with topical glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors. Dupilumab was evaluated as monotherapy in two 4-week trials and in one 12-week trial and in combination with topical glucocorticoids in another 4-week study. End points included the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, the investigator's global assessment score, pruritus, safety assessments, serum biomarker levels, and disease transcriptome. Results: In the 4-week monotherapy studies, dupilumab resulted in rapid and dose-dependent improvements in clinical indexes, biomarker levels, and the transcriptome. The results of the 12-week study of dupilumab monotherapy reproduced and extended the 4-week findings: 85% of patients in the dupilumab group, as compared with 35% of those in the placebo group, had a 50% reduction in the EASI score (EASI-50, with higher scores in the EASI indicating greater severity of eczema) (P 0.001); 40% of patients in the dupilumab group, as compared with 7% in the placebo group, had a score of 0 to 1 (indicating clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions) on the investigator's global assessment (P 0.001); and pruritus scores decreased (indicating a reduction in itch) by 55.7% in the dupilumab group versus 15.1% in the placebo group (P 0.001). In the combination study, 100% of the patients in the dupilumab group, as compared with 50% of those who received topical glucocorticoids with placebo injection, met the criterion for EASI-50 (P=0.002), despite the fact that patients who received dupilumab plus glucocorticoids used less than half the amount of topical glucocorticoids used by those who received placebo plus the topical medication (P=0.16). Adverse events, such as skin infection, occurred more frequently with placebo; nasopharyngitis and headache were the most frequent adverse events with dupilumab. Conclusions: Patients treated with dupilumab had marked and rapid improvement in all the evaluated measures of atopic dermatitis disease activity. Side-effect profiles were not dose-limiting.

Limited information exists in the literature to guide clinicians in the diagnosis and management of such patients. It is suggested that in approximately 40% of such patients a known cause for their chronic pruritic eruptions cannot be identified. In this report we will refer to this subgroup of patients as having idiopathic chronic eczematous eruption of aging (CEEA). Idiopathic CEEA must be distinguished from other established eczematous dermatoses. Idiopathic CEEA patients often require long-term systemic immunosuppressive drugs to make living bearable. Elder-onset atopic dermatitis is the most difficult of the known dermatoses to distinguish from idiopathic CEEA. Because of their clinical similarities we questioned whether dupilumab (Dupixent®), the first FDA-approved biologic for atopic dermatitis, might be valuable in the management of idiopathic CEEA. We report the case of an elderly man with idiopathic CEEA of four-years' duration who had a complete clinical response to the initiation of treatment with dupilumab. This case is presented to stimulate more discussion and systematic study of a possible role for dupilumab in otherwise-refractory idiopathic CEEA patients.

Methods: There were 75 sedentary adults aged 18+ years with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or knee osteoarthritis randomly assigned to 8 weeks of yoga (two 60-min classes and 1 home practice/wk) or waitlist. Poses were modified for individual needs. The primary endpoint was physical health [Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS)] adjusted for baseline; exploratory adjusted outcomes included fitness, mood, stress, self-efficacy, SF-36 health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and RA disease activity. In everyone completing yoga, we explored longterm effects at 9 months. Results: Participants were mostly female (96%), white (55%), and college-educated (51%), with a mean (SD) age of 52 years (12 yrs). Average disease duration was 9 years and 49% had RA. At 8 weeks, yoga was associated with significantly higher PCS (6.5, 95% CI 2.0-10.7), walking capacity (125 m, 95% CI 15-235), positive affect (5.2, 95% CI 1.4-8.9), and lower Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (-3.0, 95% CI -4.8 - -1.3). Significant improvements (p 0.05) were evident in SF-36 role physical, pain, general health, vitality, and mental health scales. Balance, grip strength, and flexibility were similar between groups. Twenty-two out of 28 in the waitlist group completed yoga. Among all yoga participants, significant (p 0.05) improvements were observed in mean PCS, flexibility, 6-min walk, and all psychological and most HRQOL domains at 8 weeks with most still evident 9 months later.

119,2021,23548052,Does yoga help reduce pain from arthritis and improve physical function?,yoga arthritis,1.0,"Background: While arthritis is the most common cause of disability, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics experience worse arthritis impact despite having the same or lower prevalence of arthritis compared to non-Hispanic whites. People with arthritis who exercise regularly have less pain, more energy, and improved sleep, yet arthritis is one of the most common reasons for limiting physical activity. Mind-body interventions, such as yoga, that teach stress management along with physical activity may be well suited for investigation in both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Yoga users are predominantly white, female, and college educated. There are few studies that examine yoga in minority populations; none address arthritis. This paper presents a study protocol examining the feasibility and acceptability of providing yoga to an urban, minority population with arthritis. Methods/design: In this ongoing pilot study, a convenience sample of 20 minority adults diagnosed with either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis undergo an 8-week program of yoga classes. It is believed that by attending yoga classes designed for patients with arthritis, with racially concordant instructors; acceptability of yoga as an adjunct to standard arthritis treatment and self-care will be enhanced. Self-care is defined as adopting behaviors that improve physical and mental well-being. This concept is quantified through collecting patient-reported outcome measures related to spiritual growth, health responsibility, interpersonal relations, and stress management. Additional measures collected during this study include: physical function, anxiety/depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social roles, and pain; as well as baseline demographic and clinical data. Field notes, quantitative and qualitative data regarding feasibility and acceptability are also collected. Acceptability is determined by response/retention rates, positive qualitative data, and continuing yoga practice after three months. Discussion: There are a number of challenges in recruiting and retaining participants from a community clinic serving minority populations. Adopting behaviors that improve well-being and quality of life include those that integrate mental health (mind) and physical health (body). Few studies have examined offering integrative modalities to this population. This pilot was undertaken to quantify measures of feasibility and acceptability that will be useful when evaluating future plans for expanding the study of yoga in urban, minority populations with arthritis.

Various environmental triggers like air pollutants, smoking, unhealthy social habits and sedentary lifestyle induce OS, which may compromise mitochondrial integrity. This trial was designed to explore the effect of 8-weeks yoga practice on mitochondrial health and disease severity in an active RA group compared with a usual-care control group. Methods: A total of 70 subjects were randomized into two groups: yoga group and non-yoga group. Mitochondrial health was assessed by calculation of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN), OS markers, mitochondrial activity, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), circadian rhythm markers and transcripts associated with mitochondrial integrity: AMPK, TIMP-1, KLOTHO, SIRT-1, and TFAM. Parameters of disease activity and disability quotient were also assessed by disease activity score - erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) and health assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-DI), respectively. Results: In yoga group, there was a significant upregulation of mtDNA-CN, mitochondrial activity markers, ΔΨm, and transcripts that maintain mitochondrial integrity after 8-weeks of yoga. There was optimization of OS markers, and circadian rhythm markers post 8-weeks practice of yoga. Yoga group participants showed significant improvements in DAS28-ESR (p 0.05) and HAQ-DI (p 0.05) over the non-yoga group. Conclusion: Adoption of yoga by RA patients holds the key to enhance mitochondrial health, improve circadian rhythm markers, OS marker regulation, upregulation of transcripts that maintain mitochondrial integrity, reduce disease activity and its associated consequences on health outcome and hence can be beneficial as an adjunct therapy.",0.7463105320930481

This study aims to systematically review and evaluate the efficacy of yoga for patients with RA. Methods: Medline (through PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE (through SCOPUS), and Web of Science database were screened through for articles published until 20 July 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of yoga in patients with RA were included. Outcomes measures were pain, physical function, disease activity, inflammatory cytokines, and grip strength. For each outcome, standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Result: Ten trials including 840 patients with RA aged 30-70 years were identified, with 86% female participants. Meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant overall effect in favor of yoga for physical function (HAQ-DI) (5 RCTs; SMD = -0.32, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.05, I <sup>2</sup> = 15%, P = 0.02), disease activity (DAS-28) (4 RCTs; SMD = -0.38, 95% CI -0.71 to -0.06, I <sup>2</sup> = 41%, P = 0.02) and grip strength (2 RCTs; SMD = 1.30, 95% CI 0.47-2.13, I <sup>2</sup> = 63%, P = 0.002). No effects were found for pain, tender joints, swollen joints count or inflammatory cytokines (i.e., CRP, ESR, IL-6, and TNF-α). Summary: The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that yoga may be beneficial for improving physical function, disease activity, and grip strength in patients with RA. However, the balance of evidence showed that yoga had no significant effect in improving pain, tender joints, swollen joints count, and inflammatory cytokines in patients suffering from RA.

Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool and quality of evidence through GRADE. Recent findings: Nine trials including 640 individuals with mainly lower extremity osteoarthritis aged 50-80 years were identified, with 80.3% female participants (median). Meta-analyses revealed very low-quality evidence for the effects of yoga on pain (vs. exercise: standardised mean difference (SMD) = - 1.07; 95%CI - 1.92, - 0.21; p = 0.01; vs. non-exercise: SMD = - 0.75; 95%CI - 1.18, - 0.31; p 0.001), physical function (vs. exercise: SMD = 0.80; 95%CI 0.36; 1.24; p 0.001; vs. non-exercise: SMD = 0.60; 95%CI 0.30, 0.98; p 0.001), and stiffness (vs. exercise: SMD = - 0.92; 95%CI - 1.69, - 0.14; p = 0.008; vs. non-exercise: SMD = - 0.76; 95%CI - 1.26, - 0.26; p = 0.003) in individuals with knee osteoarthritis. Effects were not robust against potential methodological bias. No effects were found for quality of life, and depression, or for hand osteoarthritis. Safety was rarely reported. The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that yoga may be effective for improving pain, function, and stiffness in individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee, compared to exercise and non-exercise control groups. Due to the low methodological quality and potential risk of bias, only a weak recommendation can be made at this time for the use of yoga in adults with osteoarthritis of the knee.",0.2821894884109497

All who completed were still practicing yoga three-months later. Qualitative narrative analysis identified major themes related to facilitating factors and barriers for yoga practice, self-efficacy, and support. Participant comments indicated that offering an arthritis-based yoga intervention and using a culturally congruent research design was found to be acceptable. Conclusions: As yoga research grows, there is a need to understand and promote acceptability for typically under-represented populations. This study attempts to inform the expansion of multicultural research designed to recruit and retain those from diverse backgrounds.",0.4182109832763672

Subjects were recruited from among RA patients in Dubai, United Arab Emirates by email invitations of the RA database. Demographic data, disease activity indices, health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), and quality of life (QOL) by SF-36 were documented at enrollment and after completion of 12 sessions of Raj yoga. A total of 47 patients were enrolled: 26 yoga and 21 controls. Baseline demographics were similar in both groups. Patients who underwent yoga had statistically significant improvements in DAS28 and HAQ, but not QOL. Our pilot study of 12 sessions of yoga for RA was able to demonstrate statistically significant improvements in RA disease parameters. We believe that a longer duration of treatment could result in more significant improvements.",0.47293516993522644
120,2021,12917936,Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,imitrex migraine,1.0,"Background: Migraine is a common neurovascular disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of disabling headache, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and, in some patients, neurological aura symptoms. Sumatriptan is one of a class of selective serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1B/1D) agonists (triptans) thought to relieve migraine attacks by several mechanisms, including cranial vasoconstriction and peripheral and central neural inhibition. Objectives: To describe and assess the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the efficacy and tolerability of oral sumatriptan for the treatment of a single acute attack of migraine in adults. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 through November 2001), and reference lists of articles and books. Selection criteria: We included double-blind RCTs comparing oral sumatriptan (100 mg, 50 mg, 25 mg) with placebo, no intervention, other drug treatments, behavioral therapy, or physical therapy for the treatment of an acute attack of migraine in adults. Trials comparing different doses of sumatriptan or dosing regimens were also included. Outcomes considered were: 2-hour pain-free response, headache relief/headache intensity, and functional disability; headache recurrence; and adverse events. Data collection and analysis: Data were abstracted by one reviewer and over-read by the other. The two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. Information on adverse events was collected from trial reports. Main results: Twenty-five trials involving 16,200 participants were included. Methodological quality was generally good. Sixteen trials were placebo comparisons and showed that sumatriptan in doses of 100 mg (14 trials), 50 mg (five trials), and 25 mg (three trials) provided significantly better pain-free response (100 mg and 25 mg only), headache relief, and relief of disability at 2 hours. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) for pain-free response at 2 hours were 5.1 (3.9 to 7.1) for the 100-mg dose (n = 2221) and 7.5 (2.7 to 142) for the 25-mg dose (n = 131); there was no significant difference between the 50-mg dose and placebo for this outcome (n = 127). For headache relief at 2 hours, NNTs were 3.4 (3.0 to 4.0), 3.2 (2.4 to 5.1), and 3.4 (2.3 to 6.6) for sumatriptan 100 mg (n = 2940), 50 mg (n = 420), and 25 mg (n = 226), respectively. Precise estimates of the efficacy of the 50- and 25-mg doses relative to the 100-mg dose could not be obtained. Adverse events were more common with sumatriptan 100 mg than with placebo (risk difference [RD] = 0.14 [0.09 to 0.20]; number-needed-to-harm [NNH] = 7.1 [5.0 to 11.1]; n = 3172). RDs for the 50- and 25-mg vs. placebo comparisons were not statistically significant. Reviewer's conclusions: Oral sumatriptan has been shown to be an effective drug for the treatment of a single acute attack of migraine. It is well tolerated, though minor adverse events were not uncommon in the included trials. Other triptans were generally similar in efficacy and adverse events. Among non-triptan drugs, ergotamine + caffeine was significantly less effective than sumatriptan, and other drugs have been insufficiently studied to draw firm conclusions.",0.14495441317558289

Few studies to date have proposed ginger derivates for migraine relief. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of ginger in the ablation of common migraine attack in comparison to sumatriptan therapy. In this double-blinded randomized clinical trial, 100 patients who had acute migraine without aura were randomly allocated to receive either ginger powder or sumatriptan. Time of headache onset, its severity, time interval from headache beginning to taking drug and patient self-estimation about response for five subsequent migraine attacks were recorded by patients. Patients(,) satisfaction from treatment efficacy and their willingness to continue it was also evaluated after 1 month following intervention. Two hours after using either drug, mean headaches severity decreased significantly. Efficacy of ginger powder and sumatriptan was similar. Clinical adverse effects of ginger powder were less than sumatriptan. Patients' satisfaction and willingness to continue did not differ. The effectiveness of ginger powder in the treatment of common migraine attacks is statistically comparable to sumatriptan.

Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of sumatriptan, 50-mg tablets, in treating the spectrum of headaches in IHS-diagnosed migraineurs. Design/methods: Migraineurs with severe disability (Headache Impact Questionnaire score 250 or greater) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Patients treated up to 10 headaches with sumatriptan, 50 mg, or placebo (4:1). Headache features, recorded prior to treatment, were used to classify each headache using IHS criteria. Headache response (moderate or severe pain reduced to mild or no pain) and pain-free response were recorded at 2 and 4 hours postdose (primary endpoint). Because patients treated multiple attacks, statistical methods controlling for within-subject correlation were used. Results: Two hundred forty-nine migraineurs treated 1576 moderate or severe headaches: migraine (n = 1110), migrainous (n = 103), and tension-type (n = 363). Sumatriptan was superior to placebo for headache response 4 hours postdose (primary endpoint) across all headache types (migraine, 66% versus 48%; P .001; migrainous, 71% versus 39%; P .01; tension-type, 78% versus 50%, P .001). Sumatriptan was also superior to placebo for pain-free response 4 hours postdose for migraine (41% versus 24%, P .001) and tension-type headaches (56% versus 36%, P =.001). Sumatriptan provided superior pain-free response 2 hours postdose for migraine (18% versus 7%, P .0001) and tension-type headache (28% versus 14%, P =.0005) compared with placebo. Conclusion: Sumatriptan, 50-mg tablets, are effective for the full spectrum of headaches experienced by patients with disabling migraine due to a sumatriptan-responsive mechanism.",0.18330563604831696
120,2021,7697699,Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,imitrex migraine,1.0,"Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the primary mode of action of sumatriptan: vasoconstriction, and trigeminal nerve terminal inhibition. Sumatriptan is a potent vasoconstrictor of intracranial arteries. It has been shown to increase blood flow velocity in large intracranial arteries in man in a dose-dependent fashion both during and between migraine attacks. Since the vasoconstrictor response of sumatriptan is reproducible outside the migraine attack, this action appears to be a direct vascular effect and not indirectly mediated via neural mechanisms. Sumatriptan also causes rapid constriction of dural and meningeal vessels in vivo. It does not modify cerebral blood flow but does constrict arterio-venous anastamoses that may be dilated during a migraine attack. This evidence suggests that sumatriptan has a direct, dose-related, vasoconstrictor action on certain intracranial blood vessels that correlates with its antimigraine activity. Alternatively, sumatriptan may act directly on the trigeminal sensory nerve terminals within the cranial blood vessel, inhibiting the release of sensory neuropeptides. Experimental data from animal studies have shown that following electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion there is a neurogenic inflammatory response with plasma protein extravasation from dural blood vessels. This response can be significantly reduced by sumatriptan at a dose level similar to that used in clinical treatment. This finding is further supported by the clinical observation that sumatriptan reduces the plasma levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide which are raised during a migraine attack.",0.11911690980195999

Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, after providing written informed consent, patients presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of migraine received a 500-mL bolus of IV saline solution and either 10 mg prochlorperazine with 12.5 mg diphenhydramine IV plus saline solution placebo subcutaneously or saline solution placebo IV plus 6 mg sumatriptan subcutaneously. Pain intensity was assessed with 100-mm visual analog scales (visual analog scale at baseline and every 20 minutes for 80 minutes). The primary outcome was change in pain intensity from baseline to 80 minutes or time of ED discharge if subjects remained in the ED for fewer than 80 minutes after treatment. Sedation and nausea were assessed every 20 minutes with visual analog scale scales, and subjects were contacted within 72 hours to assess headache recurrence. Results: Sixty-eight subjects entered the trial, with complete data for 66 subjects. Baseline pain scores were similar for the prochlorperazine/diphenhydramine and sumatriptan groups (76 versus 71 mm). Mean reductions in pain intensity at 80 minutes or time of ED discharge were 73 mm for the prochlorperazine/diphenhydramine group and 50 mm for those receiving sumatriptan (mean difference 23 mm; 95% confidence interval 11 to 36 mm).

We studied ATP flux from anaerobic glycolysis (An Gly), the creatine kinase reaction (CK) and oxidative phosphorylation (Ox Phos) using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) kinetic data collected during exercise. It was found that side-effects induced acutely by injection of 6 mg sumatriptan succinate s.c. were associated with reduced oxygen storage in peripheral skeletal muscle 5-20 min after injection as demonstrated by a transient reduction in mitochondrial function at end-exercise. These results suggest that mild vasoconstriction in peripheral skeletal muscle is associated with the action of sumatriptan and is likely to be the source of the side-effects experienced by some users.

Background: Migraine is a chronic, disabling disorder with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 10% in adults imposing substantial social and economic impact. Efficient treatment of migraine attacks could benefit patients by reducing their disability and the need for health care resources, and improving economic productivity. Design and methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial conducted at 5 university-affiliated research centers in Iran. Between January 2013 and April 2013, 350 individuals with a history of migraine were evaluated. Patients were diagnosed with migraine, with or without aura, as defined by the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria. The 242 patients meeting the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to SPr group (n = 121) or the sumatriptan plus placebo (SP) group (n = 121). The study medications were taken on an outpatient basis during the moderate to severe phase of migraine attack. Patients recorded details of the treated migraine on a diary card and rated pain severity immediately before dosing and 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours after dosing using a 4-point scale (0 = none to 3 = severe). Results: Of 242 patients randomized, 216 were included in the intention-to-treat efficacy analysis. In the SPr group, 39.6% of subjects experienced 2-hour headache-free response (primary outcome), which was significantly more effective than SP treatment (26.3%, odds ratio: 1.83, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-3.26, P = .038). Significantly more patients receiving SPr treatment (62.2%) had headache improvement compared with SP treatment (37.2%) at 2 hours (odds ratio: 2.77, 95% confidence interval: 1.60-4.81, P .001). A similar pattern of between-group differences was observed for 4-hour headache-free response (P = .006) and headache improvement response (P = .003). The incidence of headache recurrence within 2-48 hours after treatment was lowest in the SPr group (15.0%) compared with SP group (26.6%, P = .041). The only significant drug-related adverse events reported in ≥15% of patients in any treatment group were somnolence (32.2% and 7% in the SPr and SP groups, respectively, P .001), extrapyramidal symptoms (4.3% and 0%, P = .05), and nausea (1% and 8%, P = .03).

However, the studies with the best placebo controls have not been able to demonstrate that light treatment has a benefit beyond its placebo effect. Methods: Ninety-six patients with SAD completed the study. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments for 4 weeks, each 1.5 hours per day: morning light (average start time about 6 AM), evening light (average start about 9 PM), or morning placebo (average start about 6 AM). The bright light (approximately 6000 lux) was produced by light boxes, and the placebos were sham negative-ion generators. Depression ratings using the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, SAD version (SIGH-SAD) were performed weekly. Results: There were no differences among the 3 groups in expectation ratings or mean depression scores after 4 weeks of treatment. However, strict response criteria revealed statistically significant differences; after 3 weeks of treatment morning light produced more of the complete or almost complete remissions than placebo. By 1 criterion (24-item SIGH-SAD score 50% of baseline and or =8), 61% of the patients responded to morning light, 50% to evening light, and 32% to placebo after 4 weeks of treatment. Conclusions: Bright light therapy had a specific antidepressant effect beyond its placebo effect, but it took at least 3 weeks for a significant effect to develop.

This meta-analysis was aimed to assess the efficacy of BLT in the treatment of SAD in adults. Method: We performed a systematic literature search including randomized, single- or double-blind clinical trials investigating BLT (≥1,000 lx, light box or light visor) against dim light (≤400 lx) or sham/low-density negative ion generators as placebo. Only first-period data were used from crossover trials. The primary outcome was the post-treatment depression score measured by validated scales, and the secondary outcome was the rate of response to treatment. Results: A total of 19 studies finally met our predefined inclusion criteria. BLT was superior over placebo with a standardized mean difference of -0.37 (95% CI: -0.63 to -0.12) for depression ratings (18 studies, 610 patients) and a risk ratio of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.08-1.85) for response to active treatment (16 studies, 559 patients). We found no evidence for a publication bias, but moderate heterogeneity of the studies and a moderate-to-high risk of bias. Conclusions: BLT can be regarded as an effective treatment for SAD, but the available evidence stems from methodologically heterogeneous studies with small-to-medium sample sizes, necessitating larger high-quality clinical trials.",0.3168526887893677

Method: The authors systematically searched PubMed (January 1975 to July 2003) to identify randomized, controlled trials of light therapy for mood disorders that fulfilled predefined criteria. These articles were abstracted, and data were synthesized by disease and intervention category. Results: Only 13% of the studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses revealed that a significant reduction in depression symptom severity was associated with bright light treatment (eight studies, having an effect size of 0.84 and 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.60 to 1.08) and dawn simulation in seasonal affective disorder (five studies; effect size=0.73, 95% CI=0.37 to 1.08) and with bright light treatment in nonseasonal depression (three studies; effect size=0.53, 95% CI=0.18 to 0.89). Bright light as an adjunct to antidepressant pharmacotherapy for nonseasonal depression was not effective (five studies; effect size=-0.01, 95% CI=-0.36 to 0.34). Conclusions: Many reports of the efficacy of light therapy are not based on rigorous study designs. This analysis of randomized, controlled trials suggests that bright light treatment and dawn simulation for seasonal affective disorder and bright light for nonseasonal depression are efficacious, with effect sizes equivalent to those in most antidepressant pharmacotherapy trials.

Short wavelength light (blue) has demonstrated potency as a stimulus for acute melatonin suppression and circadian phase shifting. Methods: This study tested the efficacy of short wavelength light therapy for SAD. Blue light emitting diode (LED) units produced 468 nm light at 607 microW/cm2 (27 nm half-peak bandwidth); dim red LED units provided 654 nm at 34 microW/cm2 (21 nm half-peak bandwidth). Patients with major depression with a seasonal pattern, a score of &gt; or =20 on the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-SAD version (SIGH-SAD) and normal sleeping patterns (routine bedtimes between 10:00 pm and midnight) received 45 minutes of morning light treatment daily for 3 weeks. Twenty-four patients completed treatment following random assignment of condition (blue vs. red light). The SIGH-SAD was administered weekly. Results: Mixed-effects analyses of covariance determined that the short wavelength light treatment decreased SIGH-SAD scores significantly more than the dimmer red light condition (F = 6.45, p = .019 for average over the post-treatment times).

Objectives: To evaluate clinical effects of bright light therapy in comparison to the inactive placebo treatment for non-seasonal depression. Search strategy: We searched the Depression Anxiety &amp; Neurosis Controlled Trials register (CCDANCTR January 2003), comprising the results of searches of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 -), EMBASE (1980 -), CINAHL (1982 -), LILACS (1982 -), National Research Register, PsycINFO/PsycLIT (1974 -), PSYNDEX (1977 -), and SIGLE (1982 - ) using the group search strategy and the following terms: #30 = phototherapy or (""light therapy"" or light-therapy). We also sought trials from conference proceedings and references of included papers, and contacted the first author of each study as well as leading researchers in the field. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials comparing bright light with inactive placebo treatments for non-seasonal depression. Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted and quality assessment was made independently by two reviewers. The authors were contacted to obtain additional information. Main results: Twenty studies (49 reports) were included in the review. Most of the studies applied bright light as adjunctive treatment to drug therapy, sleep deprivation, or both. In general, the quality of reporting was poor, and many reviews did not report adverse effects systematically. The treatment response in the bright light group was better than in the control treatment group, but did not reach statistical significance. The result was mainly based on studies of less than 8 days of treatment. The response to bright light was significantly better than to control treatment in high-quality studies (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.50 to -0.31), in studies applying morning light treatment (SMD -0.38, CI -0.62 to -0.14), and in sleep deprivation responders (SMD -1.02, CI -1.60 to -0.45). Hypomania was more common in the bright light group compared to the control treatment group (risk ratio 4.91, CI 1.66 to 14.46, number needed to harm 8, CI 5 to 20). Twenty studies (49 reports) were included in the review. Most of the studies applied bright light as adjunctive treatment to drug therapy, sleep deprivation, or both. Treatment Reviewers' conclusions: For patients suffering from non-seasonal depression, bright light therapy offers modest though promising antidepressive efficacy, especially when administered during the first week of treatment, in the morning, and as an adjunctive treatment to sleep deprivation responders. Hypomania as a potential adverse effect needs to be considered. Due to limited data and heterogeneity of studies these results need to be interpreted with caution.",0.27265357971191406

121,2021,26558494,Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,light therapy lamp depression,1.0,"Background: Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review - one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD - focuses on light therapy as a preventive intervention. Light therapy is a non-pharmacological treatment that exposes people to artificial light. Mode of delivery (e.g. visors, light boxes) and form of light (e.g. bright white light) vary. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of light therapy (in comparison with no treatment, other types of light therapy, second-generation antidepressants, melatonin, agomelatine, psychological therapies, lifestyle interventions and negative ion generators) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Search methods: A search of the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neuorosis Review Group (CCDANCTR) included all years to 11 August 2015. The CCDANCTR contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials derived from EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trails (CENTRAL). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Knowledge, The Cochrane Library and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (to 26 May 2014). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and pertinent review articles. Selection criteria: For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we also intended to include non-randomised studies. We intended to include studies that compared any type of light therapy (e.g. bright white light, administered by visors or light boxes, infrared light, dawn stimulation) versus no treatment/placebo, second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), psychological therapies, melatonin, agomelatine, lifestyle changes, negative ion generators or another of the aforementioned light therapies. We also planned to include studies that looked at light therapy in combination with any comparator intervention and compared this with the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria. Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. Main results: We identified 2986 citations after de-duplication of search results. We excluded 2895 records during title and abstract review. We assessed 91 full-text papers for inclusion in the review, but only one study providing data from 46 people met our eligibility criteria. The included randomised controlled trial (RCT) had methodological limitations. We rated it as having high risk of performance and detection bias because of lack of blinding, and as having high risk of attrition bias because study authors did not report reasons for dropouts and did not integrate data from dropouts into the analysis.The included RCT compared preventive use of bright white light (2500 lux via visors), infrared light (0.18 lux via visors) and no light treatment. Overall, both forms of preventive light therapy reduced the incidence of SAD numerically compared with no light therapy. In all, 43% (6/14) of participants in the bright light group developed SAD, as well as 33% (5/15) in the infrared light group and 67% (6/9) in the non-treatment group. Bright light therapy reduced the risk of SAD incidence by 36%; however, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was very broad and included both possible effect sizes in favour of bright light therapy and those in favour of no light therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.38). Infrared light reduced the risk of SAD by 50% compared with no light therapy, but in this case also the CI was too broad to allow precise estimations of effect size (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.17). Comparison of both forms of preventive light therapy versus each other yielded similar rates of incidence of depressive episodes in both groups (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.28). The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. Reasons for downgrading evidence quality included high risk of bias of the included study, imprecision and other limitations, such as self rating of outcomes, lack of checking of compliance throughout the study duration and insufficient reporting of participant characteristics.Investigators provided no information on adverse events. We could find no studies that compared light therapy versus other interventions of interest such as SGA, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine. Authors' conclusions: Evidence on light therapy as preventive treatment for patients with a history of SAD is limited. Methodological limitations and the small sample size of the only available study have precluded review author conclusions on effects of light therapy for SAD. Given that comparative evidence for light therapy versus other preventive options is limited, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences.",0.2092999815940857
121,2021,16648320,Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,light therapy lamp depression,1.0,"Objective: Light therapy and antidepressants have shown comparable efficacy in separate studies of seasonal affective disorder treatment, but few studies have directly compared the two treatments. This study compared the effectiveness of light therapy and an antidepressant within a single trial. Method: This double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in four Canadian centers over three winter seasons. Patients met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder with a seasonal (winter) pattern and had scores &gt; or = 23 on the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. After a baseline observation week, eligible patients were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with either 1) 10,000-lux light treatment and a placebo capsule, or 2) 100-lux light treatment (placebo light) and fluoxetine, 20 mg/day. Light treatment was applied for 30 minutes/day in the morning with a fluorescent white-light box; placebo light boxes used neutral density filters. Results: A total of 96 patients were randomly assigned to a treatment condition. Intent-to-treat analysis showed overall improvement with time, with no differences between treatments. There were also no differences between the light and fluoxetine treatment groups in clinical response rates (67% for each group) or remission rates (50% and 54%, respectively). Post hoc testing found that light-treated patients had greater improvement at 1 week but not at other time points. Fluoxetine was associated with greater treatment-emergent adverse events (agitation, sleep disturbance, palpitations), but both treatments were generally well-tolerated with no differences in overall number of adverse effects. Conclusions: Light treatment showed earlier response onset and lower rate of some adverse events relative to fluoxetine, but there were no other significant differences in outcome between light therapy and antidepressant medication. Although limited by lack of a double-placebo condition, this study supports the effectiveness and tolerability of both treatments for seasonal affective disorder and suggests that other clinical factors, including patient preference, should guide selection of first-line treatment.",0.12479660660028458
121,2021,30770426,Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,light therapy lamp depression,1.0,"Objective: To assess the efficacy of bright light therapy (BLT) in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to a control light. Methods: In this double-blind controlled trial, we randomized patients with PD and MDD to treatment with BLT (±10,000 lux) or a control light (±200 lux). Participants were treated for 3 months, followed by a 6-month naturalistic follow-up. The primary outcome of the study was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score. Secondary outcomes were objective and subjective sleep measures and salivary melatonin and cortisol concentrations. Assessments were repeated halfway, at the end of treatment, and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Data were analyzed with a linear mixed-model analysis. Results: We enrolled 83 participants. HDRS scores decreased in both groups without a significant between-group difference at the end of treatment. Subjective sleep quality improved in both groups, with a larger improvement in the BLT group (B [SE] = 0.32 [0.16], p = 0.04). Total salivary cortisol secretion decreased in the BLT group, while it increased in the control group (B [SE] = -8.11 [3.93], p = 0.04). Conclusion: BLT was not more effective in reducing depressive symptoms than a control light. Mood and subjective sleep improved in both groups. BLT was more effective in improving subjective sleep quality than control light, possibly through a BLT-induced decrease in cortisol levels.

121,2021,16041296,Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,light therapy lamp depression,1.0,"Bright light therapy for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) has been investigated and applied for over 20 years. Physicians and clinicians are increasingly confident that bright light therapy is a potent, specifically active, nonpharmaceutical treatment modality. Indeed, the domain of light treatment is moving beyond SAD, to nonseasonal depression (unipolar and bipolar), seasonal flare-ups of bulimia nervosa, circadian sleep phase disorders, and more. Light therapy is simple to deliver to outpatients and inpatients alike, although the optimum dosing of light and treatment time of day requires individual adjustment. The side-effect profile is favorable in comparison with medications, although the clinician must remain vigilant about emergent hypomania and autonomic hyperactivation, especially during the first few days of treatment. Importantly, light therapy provides a compatible adjunct to antidepressant medication, which can result in accelerated improvement and fewer residual symptoms.",0.20147724449634552
122,2021,24020994,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,aleve migraine,0.0,"Objective: To compare the use of a combination of 85 mg sumatriptan plus 500 mg naproxen sodium in a combination tablet with 500 mg naproxen sodium in an identically appearing tablet when used as a daily preventative and acute treatment for 1 month and episodic acute treatment for an additional 2 months in patients with chronic migraine. Background: To date, there has been minimal study of acute medications for patients with chronic migraine. Consequently, there is a paucity of study methodology or evidence-based guidance on the use of acute treatment medications in patients with chronic migraine. Methods: This two-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, comparator pilot trial of 28 subjects, 18 to 65 years of age, with ICHD-II defined chronic migraine, was designed to generate hypotheses about the efficacy of 2 established acute migraine medications used both as a daily preventive treatment (month 1) and episodic acute treatment (months 1, 2, and 3). Subjects were randomized 1:1 to treat daily with SumaRT/Nap (85 mg sumatriptan + 500 mg naproxen sodium) (group A) or naproxen sodium (500 mg) (group B) in a prophylactic strategy for 1 month followed by 2 months of the same medications used for episodic acute treatment. Results: The combination of SumaRT/Nap used over a 3-month period did not appear to significantly reduce the number of migraine headache days. In the subset of subjects using naproxen sodium and completing the study per protocol, there was a marked reduction in migraine headache days (P .02 vs 0.25, respectively). Duration of migraine from treatment to pain free decreased in both groups, but was more robust in group B from baseline to month 3. Subjects in group B completing the study per protocol reported a 56% reduction in headache days vs 8% for group A. Subjects in group A and group B completing the study per protocol had considerably better 2-hour headache relief than subjects withdrawing early from the study. More subjects in group B prematurely withdrew from the study because of lack of efficacy (5 vs 1, respectively). Despite using significant quantities of acute medication during month 1, there was a reduction of acute medication in month 2 and 3 vs baseline vs month 1, particularly in the naproxen group. Conclusion: A combination of SumaRT/Nap (group A) did not appear to reduce migraine headache frequency over a 3-month period. Subjects using naproxen sodium (group B) alone and completing the study per protocol had a marked statistically significant reduction in migraine headache days. Both groups completing the study per protocol had experienced clinically meaningful 2-hour headache relief. This suggests there may be a subset of patients with chronic migraine that are responsive to high doses of naproxen as an acute intervention with a significant prophylactic benefit. Subjects randomized to SumaRT/Nap experience benefit, primarily as an acute intervention. This hypothesis may warrant future larger scale clinical trials. Frequent dosing of SumaRT/Nap or naproxen sodium was well tolerated in this study.",0.15269061923027039
122,2021,16109111,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,aleve migraine,0.0,"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment with a combination of sumatriptan 50 mg (encapsulated) and naproxen sodium 500 mg administered concurrently in the acute treatment of migraine. Background: The pathogenesis of migraine involves multiple peripheral and central neural mechanisms that individually have been successful targets for acute (abortive) and preventive treatment. This suggests that multi-mechanism therapy, which acts on multiple target sites, may confer improved efficacy and symptom relief for patients with migraine. Design and methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, four-arm study. Participants (n = 972) treated a single moderate or severe migraine attack with placebo, naproxen sodium 500 mg, sumatriptan 50 mg, or a combination of sumatriptan 50 mg and naproxen sodium 500 mg. In the latter two treatment arms, the sumatriptan tablets were encapsulated in order to achieve blinding of the study. Results: In the sumatriptan plus naproxen sodium group, 46% of subjects achieved 24-hour pain relief response (primary endpoint), which was significantly more effective than sumatriptan alone (29%), naproxen sodium alone (25%), or placebo (17%) (P .001). Two-hour headache response also significantly favored the sumatriptan 50 mg plus naproxen sodium 500 mg therapy (65%) versus sumatriptan (49%), naproxen sodium (46%), or placebo (27%) (P .001). A similar pattern of between-group differences was observed for 2-hour pain-free response and sustained pain-free response (P .001). The incidence of headache recurrence up to 24 hours after treatment was lowest in the sumatriptan plus naproxen sodium group (29%) versus sumatriptan alone (41%; P = .048), versus naproxen sodium alone (47%; P= .0035), and versus placebo (38%; P= .08). The incidences of the associated symptoms of migraine were significantly lower at 2 hours following sumatriptan 50 mg plus naproxen sodium 500 mg treatment versus placebo (P .001). The frequencies and types of adverse events reported did not differ between treatment groups, with dizziness and somnolence being the most common. Conclusions: This is among the first prospective studies to demonstrate that multi-mechanism acute therapy for migraine, combining a triptan and an analgesic, is well tolerated and offers improved clinical benefits over monotherapy with these selected standard antimigraine treatments. Specifically, sumatriptan 50 mg (encapsulated) and naproxen sodium 500 mg resulted in significantly superior pain relief as compared to monotherapy with either sumatriptan 50 mg (encapsulated) or naproxen sodium 500 mg for the acute treatment of migraine. Because encapsulation of the sumatriptan for blinding purposes may have altered its pharmacokinetic profile and thereby decreased the efficacy responses, additional studies are warranted that do not involve encapsulation of the active treatments and assess the true onset of action of multi-mechanism therapy in migraine. This study did show that the combination of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium was well tolerated and that there was no significant increase in the incidence of adverse events compared to monotherapy.",0.23124051094055176

This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan/naproxen sodium for the acute treatment of probable migraine without aura. Methods: Patients treated a headache of probable migraine without aura when pain was moderate or severe with sumatriptan/naproxen sodium ( N = 222 intent-to-treat (ITT)) or placebo ( N = 221 ITT/complete case analysis (a) ) in this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. Results: Sumatriptan/naproxen sodium was more effective than placebo with respect to the co-primary efficacy endpoints two-hour pain-free response (29% sumatriptan/naproxen sodium vs 11% placebo, P 0.001) and two- to 24-hour sustained pain-free response (24% sumatriptan/naproxen sodium vs 9% placebo, P 0.001). Sumatriptan/naproxen sodium was significantly more effective than placebo with respect to the secondary efficacy endpoints of pain-free response four hours postdose ( P 0.001), pain-free response maintained one to two hours postdose ( P = 0.034) and two to four hours postdose ( P 0.001), headache relief four hours postdose ( P 0.001), headache relief maintained two to four hours postdose ( P = 0.015), sustained headache relief two through 24 hours postdose ( P = 0.002), and rescue medication use ( P 0.001); but not productivity scores.

The initial dose of naproxen sodium was 825 mg followed one hour later by a further 550 mg, if symptoms were the same or had improved. If the migraine symptoms had worsened, patients were offered an escape analgesic combination of 1000 mg paracetamol and 10 mg metoclopramide. Patients were assessed at monthly intervals for changes in the severity and duration of headache, premonitory symptoms (mainly visual disturbances) and photophobia, nausea and vomiting associated with migraine attacks that had occurred since the previous visit. Patients were studied for a maximum of ten attacks and significant improvement was observed in the severity and duration of headache when the patients were on naproxen sodium. Also the premonitory symptoms and photophobia improved significantly on naproxen sodium and significantly less rescue analgesics were required. Patients suffering from common migraine had less severe headaches and photophobia when taking naproxen sodium than when taking placebo and the headaches were shorter in duration and patients took less rescue analgesic. No significant difference was observed between the treatment groups in patients with classical migraine. Ten patients in the placebo group and six in the naproxen sodium group reported side-effects but these were possibly related to the use of rescue medication. Naproxen sodium proved safe and effective in common migraine attacks, but in this study efficacy was not established for classical migraine.",0.1502716988325119

122,2021,20236345,Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,aleve migraine,0.0,"Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of naproxen sodium in the treatment of acute migraine attacks. Background: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including naproxen sodium have been used in treating migraine attack. A number of clinical trials of naproxen sodium in migraine have been reported. However, it remains to be established whether naproxen sodium unequivocally offers clinical benefits taken into account the desired outcomes in acute migraine therapy as recommended by the International Headache Society. Methods: Clinical trials were identified through electronic searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM review, and the Cochrane Library) up to June 2009 and historical searches of relevant articles. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they were (1) double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated naproxen sodium tablet in moderate or severe migraine attacks in adult patients, and (2) reporting the efficacy in terms of headache relief, pain-free, relief of migraine-associated symptoms, sustained headache relief, sustained pain-free, or headache recurrence. Data extraction and study quality assessment were performed independently by 2 investigators. Disagreements were resolved by a third investigator. Treatment effects and adverse effects were expressed as risk ratio. A random effects model was used when significant heterogeneity existed, otherwise the fixed effects model was performed. Results: We identified 16 published randomized controlled trials of naproxen in the treatment of migraine. Four trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Naproxen sodium was more effective than placebo in reducing pain intensity and providing pain-free within 2 hours in adults with moderate or severe migraine attacks. The pooled risk ratios were 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-1.77, P .00001), and 2.22 (95% CI 1.46-3.37, P = .0002), respectively, for headache relief at 2 hours and pain-free at 2 hours. It was also effective in achieving headache relief at 4 hours, relief of migraine-associated symptoms, sustained headache relief, and sustained pain-free responses. There was no significant difference in headache recurrence rate between naproxen sodium and placebo. The risk of any adverse event was greater with naproxen sodium than with placebo (pooled risk ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.04-1.60, P = .02). The adverse events commonly associated with naproxen sodium were nausea, dizziness, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Conclusions: The available evidence suggests that naproxen sodium is more effective but may cause more adverse events than placebo in the acute treatment of moderate to severe migraine. It is effective in reducing headache intensity, rendering pain-free at 2 hours and improving migraine-associated symptoms. However, its effectiveness relative to other active comparators needs to be better defined by appropriate head-to-head clinical trials.",0.19160941243171692

Daily oral NxS (550 mg) from 7 days before menstruation to 7 days after menstruation onset was given for 3 menstrual cycles, and 5 days before menstruation to 5 days after menstruation onset over the next 3 menstrual cycles. In the month before initiation of treatment and in the third month of treatment, 6-keto-PGF1(alpha), TXB(2) and PGE(2) were measured in plasma before menstruation (day -2) and on the second day (day +2) after bleeding onset. In the 20 women analysed, 6-keto-PGF1(alpha) was 17% lower (p 0.0001) and TXB(2) was 30% lower (p 0.0001) on day -2 during treatment than the same day pretreatment; TXB(2) was also lower (p 0.02) on day +2 during treatment than day +2 pretreatment. The 6-keto-PGF1(alpha)/TXB(2) ratio was higher (p 0.01) on day -2 treatment than day -2 pretreatment.

Methods: Adults with migraine (n = 50) without 'medication overuse headache' were treated for up to 18 migraine attacks per 3-month study period with study medication; SNC during one study period and S/N during the other study period. For all endpoints, differences between treatments were compared with paired t tests. Results: The percentage of patients reporting satisfied/very satisfied for Overall Satisfaction of SNC versus S/N (primary endpoint) was 85% versus 72% respectively (p = 0.054). For Overall Effectiveness, the results were 82% for SNC versus 73% for S/N (p = 0.159); and for Overall Side Effects the results were 86% for SNC versus 69% for S/N (p = 0.005). Mean PPMQ-R scores reflect greater satisfaction with SNC than S/N for Total score and for each of four subscales. The difference between SNC and S/N was significant for the Ease of Use subscale (p = 0.004) and met the criterion of being clinically meaningful for both the Total score and Ease of Use. SNC did not differ from S/N with respect to pain-free response 2 h post dose, pain relief 2 h post dose, sustained 24 h pain-free response, or sustained 24 h pain relief.

126,2021,26249739,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,"Background: Probiotics may improve a person's health by regulating their immune function. Some trials have shown that probiotic strains can prevent respiratory infections. Even though the previous version of our review showed benefits of probiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), several new studies have been published. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose), compared with placebo, in the prevention of acute URTIs in people of all ages, who are at risk of acute URTIs. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to July week 3, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to July 2014), Web of Science (1900 to July 2014), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, which includes the China Biological Medicine Database (from 1978 to July 2014), the Chinese Medicine Popular Science Literature Database (from 2000 to July 2014) and the Masters Degree Dissertation of Beijing Union Medical College Database (from 1981 to July 2014). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for completed and ongoing trials on 31 July 2014. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics with placebo to prevent acute URTIs. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of trials, and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results: We included 13 RCTs, although we could only extract data to meta-analyze 12 trials, which involved 3720 participants including children, adults (aged around 40 years) and older people. We found that probiotics were better than placebo when measuring the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTI [at least one episode: odds ratio (OR): 0.53; 95% CI = 0.37-0.76, P .001, low quality evidence; at least three episodes: OR: 0.53; 95% CI = 0.36-0.80, P = .002, low quality evidence]; the mean duration of an episode of acute URTI [mean difference (MD): -1.89; 95% CI = -2.03 to -1.75, P .001, low quality evidence]; reduced antibiotic prescription rates for acute URTIs (OR: 0.65; 95% CI = 0.45-0.94, moderate quality evidence) and cold-related school absence (OR: 0.10; 95% CI = 0.02-0.47, very low quality evidence). Probiotics and placebo were similar when measuring the rate ratio of episodes of acute URTI (rate ratio: 0.83; 95% CI = 0.66-1.05, P = .12, very low quality evidence) and adverse events (OR: 0.88; 95% CI = 0.65-1.19, P = .40, low quality evidence). Side effects of probiotics were minor and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common. We found that some subgroups had a high level of heterogeneity when we conducted pooled analyses and the evidence level was low or very low quality. Authors' conclusions: Probiotics were better than placebo in reducing the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTI, the mean duration of an episode of acute URTI, antibiotic use and cold-related school absence.

126,2021,27495104,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,"Background: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) represent one of the main health problems in children. Probiotics are viable bacteria that colonize the intestine and affect the host intestinal microbial balance. Accumulating evidence suggests that probiotic consumption may decrease the incidence of or modify RTIs. The authors systematically reviewed data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the effect of probiotic consumption on RTIs in children. Methods: MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were systematically searched for RCTs regarding the effect of probiotics on RTIs in children. The outcomes included number of children experienced with at least 1 RTI episode, duration of illness episodes, days of illness per subject, and school/day care absenteeism due to infection. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled relative risks, or mean difference (MD) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 23 trials involving 6269 children were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. None of the trials showed a high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence of outcomes was moderate. The age range of subjects was from newborn to 18 years. The results of meta-analysis showed that probiotic consumption significantly decreased the number of subjects having at least 1 RTI episode (17 RCTs, 4513 children, relative risk 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.96, P = 0.004). Children supplemented with probiotics had fewer numbers of days of RTIs per person compared with children who had taken a placebo (6 RCTs, 2067 children, MD -0.16, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.02, P = 0.03), and had fewer numbers of days absent from day care/school (8 RCTs, 1499 children, MD -0.94, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.15, P = 0.02). However, there was no statistically significant difference of illness episode duration between probiotic intervention group and placebo group (9 RCTs, 2817 children, MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.49 to 0.30, P = 0.19). Conclusion: Based on the available data and taking into account the safety profile of RCTs, probiotic consumption appears to be a feasible way to decrease the incidence of RTIs in children.",0.35278046131134033

Probiotics are non-pathogenic live microorganisms that, when ingested in adequate amounts, can colonize the intestinal tract, and enhance the immune system. In recent years, numerous studies have described the possible usefulness of certain probiotic strains in the treatment and prevention of respiratory tract infections, with disparate results. In order to assess the possible efficacy and safety of these microorganisms to prevent or ameliorate respiratory tract infections, we systematically searched the bibliographic databases MEDLINE (via Pubmed), EMBASE, The Cochrane library, Scopus, and Web of science, using the descriptors ""Respiratory Tract Infections"", ""Probiotics"", ""Occupational Health"", ""Humans"", and ""Clinical Trials"". After applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 18 studies were accepted for review and critical analysis. Our analysis suggests that a combination of different probiotics, most of them in the genus Bifidobacterium sp. and Lactobacillus sp., could be a good mix to strengthen the immune system and reduce the symptoms of URTIs in the healthy working population.",0.4848707914352417

Eight randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials met the inclusion criteria, considering the threshold of older people being 60 years and over. Single strain probiotics were used in all studies, including three probiotic strains used in fermented foods: Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei subsp . paracasei CNCM I-1518 and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Shirota, and three probiotic strains used as food supplements: Loigolactobacillus coryniformis K8 CECT5711, Bacillus subtilis CU1 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG. Current evidence showed that certain probiotic strains were better than a placebo in lowering the incidence or number of older people experiencing acute upper respiratory tract infections; however, not all probiotic strains were efficient, and not all studies reported statistically significant outcomes. More high quality large-scale properly controlled clinical studies focusing on older people are warranted.",0.2687253952026367

Some trials show that probiotic strains can prevent respiratory infections. Even though our previously published review showed the benefits of probiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), several new studies have been published. This is an update of a review first published in 2011 and updated in 2015. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose), compared with placebo or no treatment, in the prevention of acute URTIs in people of all ages, at risk of acute URTIs. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2022, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to May week 2, 2022), Embase (1974 to 10 May 2022), Web of Science (1900 to 10 May 2022), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, which includes the China Biological Medicine Database (from 1978 to 10 May 2022), the Chinese Medicine Popular Science Literature Database (from 2000 to 10 May 2022), and the Master's Degree Dissertation of Beijing Union Medical College Database (from 1981 to 10 May 2022). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for completed and ongoing trials on 10 May 2022. Selection criteria: We included individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs comparing probiotics with placebo or no treatment to prevent acute URTIs. The participants were children, adults, or the elderly in the community, care facilities, schools, or hospitals. Our main outcomes were the number of participants diagnosed with URTIs (at least one event and at least three events), the incidence rate (number of cases/person year) of acute URTIs, and the mean duration of an episode of URTIs. Our secondary outcomes were the number of participants who were absent from childcare centre, school, or work due to acute URTIs; the number of participants who used prescribed antibiotics for acute URTIs; and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event from probiotics. We excluded studies if they did not specify acute respiratory infections as 'upper'; studies with more than 50% of participants vaccinated against influenza or other acute URTIs within the last 12 months; and studies with significantly different proportions of vaccinated participants between the probiotics arm and the placebo or no treatment arm. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials and extracted data using standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We analysed both intention-to-treat and per-protocol data and used a random-effects model. We expressed results as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included 23 individual RCTs and one cluster-RCT. As one of the individual RCTs did not report outcomes in a usable way, we could only meta-analyse data from 23 trials, involving a total of 6950 participants including children (aged from one month to 11 years old), adults (mean age 37.3), and older people (mean age 84.6 years). One trial reported 22.5% flu-vaccine participants within the last 12 months, and 25.4% flu-vaccine participants during the intervention. Probiotics were more likely to be given with milk-based food in children; administered in powder form in adults; and given with milk-based food or in capsules in the elderly. Most of the studies used one or two strains (e.g. Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL9, Lactobacillus paracasei (8700:2 or N1115)) and 10<sup>9</sup> or 10<sup>11</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/day of probiotics for more than three months. We found that probiotics may reduce the number of participants diagnosed with URTIs (at least one event) (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87; P 0.001; 16 studies, 4798 participants; low-certainty evidence); likely reduce the number of participants diagnosed with URTIs (at least three events) (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.91; P = 0.02; 4 studies, 763 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); may reduce the incidence rate (number of cases/person year) of URTIs (rate ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92, P = 0.001; 12 studies, 4364 participants; low-certainty evidence); may reduce the mean duration of an episode of acute URTIs (MD -1.22 days, 95% CI -2.12 to -0.33; P = 0.007; 6 studies, 2406 participants; low-certainty evidence); likely reduce the number of participants who used prescribed antibiotics for acute URTIs (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.81; P = 0.001; 6 studies, 1548 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and may not increase the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.15; P = 0.79; 8 studies, 2456 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence showing a decrease in the number of people absent from childcare centre, school, or work due to acute URTIs with probiotics is very uncertain (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.59; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events from probiotics were minor, and most commonly gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea, and bowel pain.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying the effects of probiotics for the prevention of upper or lower RTIs were systematically identified. Fourteen RCTs (twelve involving healthy subjects and two involving patients with RTIs) were included. Various Lactobacillus strains were used in seven RCTs, combinations of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains were used in five RCTs, and a Bifidobacterium strain and a non-pathogenic Enterococcus faecalis strain were used in one RCT, respectively. In ten RCTs no difference was found regarding the incidence of RTIs in the probiotic arm compared with the control arm, whereas the remaining four RCTs favoured the use of probiotics. Reduction in the severity of symptoms related to RTIs was noted in five of six RCTs that provided relevant data. In three of nine RCTs that provided relevant data, the clinical course of RTIs was shorter in the probiotic arm, whereas no difference was found in the remaining six RCTs. In conclusion, probiotics may have a beneficial effect on the severity and duration of symptoms of RTIs but do not appear to reduce the incidence of RTIs.",0.1764792501926422

Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, quality of trials and extracted data. Main results: We included 14 RCTs, although we could only extract available data to meta-analyse in 10 trials which involved 3451 participants. We found that probiotics were better than placebo when measuring the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTI: at least one episode: odds ratio (OR) 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 0.92; at least three episodes: OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.80; rate ratio of episodes of acute URTI: rate ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96; and reduced antibiotic prescription rates for acute URTIs: OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.98. Probiotics and placebo were similar when measuring the mean duration (MD) of an episode of acute URTI: MD -0.29; 95% CI -3.71 to 3.13 and adverse events: OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.28. Side effects of probiotics were minor and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common. We found that some subgroups had a high level of heterogeneity when conducting pooled analyses. Authors' conclusions: Probiotics were better than placebo in reducing the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTIs, the rate ratio of episodes of acute URTI and reducing antibiotic use. This indicates that probiotics may be more beneficial than placebo for preventing acute URTIs. However, the results have some limitations and there were no data for older people.",0.24615013599395752
126,2021,20107143,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,"The rationale for the use of probiotics in the management of infectious diseases is supported by their potential to influence and stabilize the composition of gut microbiota, enhance colonization resistance, and modulate immune function parameters. A literature review was conducted to determine the efficacy of using probiotics in selected infections: 1) infectious diarrhea in infants and children, 2) traveler's diarrhea, 3) necrotizing enterocolitis in infants, 4) Helicobacter pylori infection, 5) respiratory tract infections in adults and children, 6) ear, nose, and throat infections, and 7) infectious complications in surgical and critically ill patients. The different types of infections that have been subject to clinical studies with different probiotics obviously prevent any generic conclusions. Furthermore, the lack of consistency among studies focusing on 1 specific infection, in study design, applied probiotic strains, outcome parameters, and study population, along with the still limited number of studies, preclude clear and definite conclusions on the efficacy of probiotics and illustrate the need for better-aligned study designs and methodology. Exceptions were the management of infectious diarrhea in infants and traveler's diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Sufficient consistent data exist for these applications to conclude that certain probiotics, under certain conditions, and in certain target populations, are beneficial in reducing the risk of infection. In addition, some evidence exists, although conclusions are premature, for the management of Helicobacter pylori infection and possible reduction of treatment side effects. Certain probiotics may also reduce the risk of various symptoms of respiratory tract infections in adults and children, including ear, nose, and throat infections, although data are currently far too limited to distill any clinical recommendations in this area. Positive but also negative results have been obtained in prevention of infectious complications in surgical and critically ill patients. For future studies it is recommended that researchers provide adequate power, identify pathogens, and report both clinical outcomes and immune biomarkers relating to putative underlying mechanisms.",0.13998158276081085

Prevention of these infections in childhood is a very important public health challenge. Previous systematic reviews, including both adult and childhood populations, have reported that probiotics seem promising, but with modest evidence. This study aimed to focus on prophylactic probiotic use in the prevention of URTIs in childhood. Methods: Relevant trials on two databases were identified in a systematic review, from inception to June 2014. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were carried out by two reviewers. In this review, the effects of probiotics, particularly the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains, on the incidence and symptom scores of URTI in otherwise healthy children were evaluated for the first time. This review comprises 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) applied to a pediatric population with high-quality methodology. Results: This systematic review suggests that probiotics in immunocompetent children have a modest effect both in diminishing the incidence of URTIs and the severity of the infection symptoms. Conclusions: At least one beneficial effect of prophylactic probiotic was observed in the majority of RCTs. Even a minimal reduction of 5 - 10% in the incidence of URTIs would have an important clinical and economic mpact on societies. Furthermore, the long-term administration of probiotics appeared to have a good safety profile in childhood and none of the studies reported any serious adverse events related to the probiotic strain.",0.48137345910072327

Methods: This qualitative study was based on phenomenological principles applied through focused inquiry to develop an understanding of the lived experience of the study participants. The inclusion criteria of an established diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and known use of CT were applied to a convenience sample of patients attending a rheumatology outpatient department clinic on two consecutive days. Of the 15 eligible patients identified, five were randomly selected for inclusion in the study. Narrative data were collected through analysis of transcripts taken from audiotape recordings of unstructured interviews with study participants. A manual indexing system was used to develop four significant categorisation themes to reflect the findings: (1) incentives to use CT, (2) perceived benefits of CT use, (3) the choice of CT used, and (4) perceived disadvantages and risks of CT use. Results: Incentives to use CT included dissatisfaction with conventional treatment, often in the form of side effects, and drug ineffectiveness. Social factors, such as loss of employment and social activities, were also indicated, as were psychological changes in the form of depression, hopelessness and fear. Perceived benefits were categorised as either physical or psychological with associated aspects of choice and control viewed as important elements of personal empowerment. The choice of CT used fell into three categories; physical, spiritual and herbal. The most commonly used of these were herbal remedies and supplements, closely followed by aromatherapy massage. Disadvantages and risks were identified as physical (pain and discomfort), psychological (fear and uncertainty), and/or material (cost). Conclusions: This study suggests that regular use of CT by patients with rheumatoid arthritis offers holistic benefits. Compared to conventional treatments, CT is seen to have advantages in terms of a lower incidence of adverse reactions, greater patient choice, psychological comfort and an increased quality of the patient/therapist relationship. The use of CT by patients with rheumatoid arthritis indicates a need for evidence-based information about its use and safety in order to direct practice within a rheumatology department.",0.5966719388961792
128,2021,16855994,Does steam from a shower help croup?,steam shower croup,0.0,"Background: Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is a common cause of upper airway obstruction in children with a peak incidence of 60 per 1000 child years in those aged between one and two years. It is characterised by hoarseness, a barking cough, and inspiratory stridor. These symptoms are thought to occur as a result of oedema of the larynx and trachea, which have been triggered by a recent viral infection. Para influenza virus type 1 is the agent most commonly identified in cases of croup. Severe cases are admitted to hospital and steroid treatment is established to reduce disease severity. Treatment with humidified air was previously widely used and is still commonly recommended as home treatment. Objectives: To assess the efficacy of humidified air in the treatment of croup. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006) and EMBASE (1990 to January 2006). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving children suffering from croup treated with humidified air. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently identified potentially relevant abstracts identified from the search and then assessed the full papers for inclusion and methodological quality. Outcome measures included mortality, ventilation, admission to hospital, re-contact with medical services, number of days off school and relief of symptoms; these were separately analysed for the week following treatment. Data extraction was performed by the two authors then entered by one and checked by the second author. Missing data were obtained from trails authors where possible. Data were analysed using Review Manager version 4.2. Sensitivity and sub-group analysis were not possible due to the paucity of trials. Main results: Three studies in emergency settings provided data on 135 patients with moderate croup for the main outcome (croup score). The combined results from 20 to 60 minutes in the three studies marginally favoured the treatment group with a weighted standardised mean difference of -0.14 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.75 to 0.47). No other outcomes were significantly different between the groups. Authors' conclusions: The croup score of children managed in an emergency setting with mild to moderate croup probably does not improve greatly with inhalation of humidified air. Further research is needed in primary care settings, using a wider range of more sensitive outcome measures.",0.15299701690673828

Results can be variable, and historical experience suggests that higher concentrations of topical minoxidil may enhance efficacy. Objective: The purpose of this 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter trial was to compare 5% topical minoxidil with 2% topical minoxidil and placebo in the treatment of men with AGA. Methods: A total of 393 men (18-49 years old) with AGA applied 5% topical minoxidil solution (n = 157), 2% topical minoxidil solution (n = 158), or placebo (vehicle for 5% solution; n = 78) twice daily. Efficacy was evaluated by scalp target area hair counts and patient and investigator assessments of change in scalp coverage and benefit of treatment. Results: After 48 weeks of therapy, 5% topical minoxidil was significantly superior to 2% topical minoxidil and placebo in terms of change from baseline in nonvellus hair count, patient rating of scalp coverage and treatment benefit, and investigator rating of scalp coverage. Hair count data indicate that response to treatment occurred earlier with 5% compared with 2% topical minoxidil. Additionally, data from a patient questionnaire on quality of life, global benefit, hair growth, and hair styling demonstrated that 5% topical minoxidil helped improve patients' psychosocial perceptions of hair loss. An increased occurrence of pruritus and local irritation was observed with 5% topical minoxidil compared with 2% topical minoxidil. Conclusion: In men with AGA, 5% topical minoxidil was clearly superior to 2% topical minoxidil and placebo in increasing hair regrowth, and the magnitude of its effect was marked (45% more hair regrowth than 2% topical minoxidil at week 48). Men who used 5% topical minoxidil also had an earlier response to treatment than those who used 2% topical minoxidil. Psychosocial perceptions of hair loss in men with AGA were also improved. Topical minoxidil (5% and 2%) was well tolerated by the men in this trial without evidence of systemic effects.",0.3407437205314636

Objective: To describe the safety of LDOM for the treatment of hair loss in a large cohort of patients. Methods: Retrospective multicenter study of patients treated with LDOM for at least 3 months for any type of alopecia. Results: A total of 1404 patients (943 women [67.2%] and 461 men [32.8%]) with a mean age of 43 years (range 8-86) were included. The dose of LDOM was titrated in 1065 patients, allowing the analysis of 2469 different cases. The most frequent adverse effect was hypertrichosis (15.1%), which led to treatment withdrawal in 14 patients (0.5%). Systemic adverse effects included lightheadedness (1.7%), fluid retention (1.3%), tachycardia (0.9%), headache (0.4%), periorbital edema (0.3%), and insomnia (0.2%), leading to drug discontinuation in 29 patients (1.2%).

Results can be variable, and historic experience suggests that higher concentrations of topical minoxidil may enhance efficacy. Objective: The purpose of this 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter trial was to compare the efficacy and safety of 5% topical minoxidil with 2% topical minoxidil and placebo in the treatment of female pattern hair loss. Methods: A total of 381 women (18-49 years old) with female pattern hair loss applied 5% topical minoxidil solution (n = 153), 2% topical minoxidil solution (n = 154), or placebo (vehicle for 5% solution; n = 74) twice daily. Primary efficacy variables were change in nonvellus hair count at week 48, and patient and investigator assessments of change in hair growth/scalp coverage at week 48. Results: After 48 weeks of therapy, 5% topical minoxidil was superior to placebo for each of the 3 primary efficacy measures. The 2% topical minoxidil group demonstrated superiority over placebo for hair count and investigator assessment of hair growth/scalp coverage at week 48; differences in patient assessment of hair growth at week 48 were not significantly different from placebo. The 5% topical minoxidil group demonstrated statistical superiority over the 2% topical minoxidil group in the patient assessment of treatment benefit at week 48.

A 7-day dose-finding study showed that both 0.5- and 2.0-mg doses of the drug produced a similar diminution in serum dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in male stumptails. Hair growth was evaluated by shaving and weighing scalp hair at baseline and at 4-week intervals during treatment to obtain cumulative delta hair weight (sum of the 4-week changes in hair weight from baseline) for the 20-week study. The activity of the 5 alpha-reductase enzyme was assessed by RIA of serum testosterone (T) and DHT at 4-week intervals. The combination of finasteride and minoxidil generated significant augmentation of hair weight (additive effect) compared to either drug alone. Finasteride increased hair weight in four of five monkeys. When the data of the one nonresponsive monkey were excluded, finasteride elicited a significant elevation in hair weight compared to topical vehicle alone. Minoxidil also evoked a significant increase in hair weight compared to vehicle alone. Serum T was unchanged, whereas serum DHT was significantly depressed in monkeys that received either finasteride or the combination of finasteride and minoxidil. These data suggest that inhibition of the conversion of T to DHT by this 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor reverses the balding process and enhances hair regrowth by topical minoxidil in the male balding stumptail macaque.",0.30994024872779846
129,2021,14996087,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,"We have known for over 30 years that minoxidil stimulates hair growth, yet our understanding of its mechanism of action on the hair follicle is very limited. In animal studies, topical minoxidil shortens telogen, causing premature entry of resting hair follicles into anagen, and it probably has a similar action in humans. Minoxidil may also cause prolongation of anagen and increases hair follicle size. Orally administered minoxidil lowers blood pressure by relaxing vascular smooth muscle through the action of its sulphated metabolite, minoxidil sulphate, as an opener of sarcolemmal KATP channels. There is some evidence that the stimulatory effect of minoxidil on hair growth is also due to the opening of potassium channels by minoxidil sulphate, but this idea has been difficult to prove and to date there has been no clear demonstration that KATP channels are expressed in the hair follicle. A number of in vitro effects of minoxidil have been described in monocultures of various skin and hair follicle cell types including stimulation of cell proliferation, inhibition of collagen synthesis, and stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and prostaglandin synthesis. Some or all of these effects may be relevant to hair growth, but the application of results obtained in cell culture studies to the complex biology of the hair follicle is uncertain.

Objective: In recent years, oral minoxidil at low dose has been proposed as a safe alternative. This study reviewed articles in which oral minoxidil was used to treat hair loss to determine its efficacy and safety as an alternative to topical minoxidil. Methods: PubMed searches were performed to identify articles discussing oral minoxidil as the primary form of treatment for hair loss published up to April 2020. Results: A total of 17 studies with 634 patients were found discussing the use of oral minoxidil as the primary treatment modality for hair loss. Androgenetic alopecia was the most studied condition, but other conditions included telogen effluvium, lichen planopilaris, loose anagen hair syndrome, monilethrix, alopecia areata, and permanent chemotherapy-induced alopecia.

There are approximately 2 dozen such clinics in Tijuana, some of which have been treating international cancer patients since 1963. Among the first clinics to be established were the Bio-Medical Center (Hoxsey therapy), Oasis of Hope (a Laetrile-oriented clinic), and a series of clinics affiliated with the Gerson diet therapy. These original clinics were established mainly by American citizens in response to increased regulation of nonstandard therapies in the United States, particularly after passage of the Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act in 1962. In the 1970s, the Tijuana clinics proliferated with the upsurge of interest in Laetrile (amygdalin). By 1978, 70,000 US cancer patients had taken Laetrile for cancer treatment, and many of those had gone to Tijuana to receive it. The popularity of the Tijuana clinics peaked in the mid-1980s. Although many new clinics opened after then, a dozen have folded in the past 10 years alone. The turning point for the clinics came with passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which facilitated greater cooperation among the antifraud authorities of Canada, the United States, and Mexico. In 1994, the tripartite members of NAFTA formed the Mexico-United States-Canada Health Fraud Work Group, or MUCH, whose brief is to strengthen the 3 countries' ability to prevent cross-border health fraud. Under the auspices of MUCH and its members, regulatory crackdowns began in earnest early in 2001. The clinics were also badly affected by the general downturn in travel after 9/11. If these trends continue, many Tijuana clinics are unlikely to survive. Some suggestions are made for how the Tijuana clinics could be reorganized and reformed to minimize the likelihood of governmental actions and to maximize public support. Such reforms center on 5 main areas: (1) research, (2) physical plant, (3) finances, (4) ethics, and (5) education.",0.24492384493350983

Participants: All licensed naturopathic physicians in the United States and Canada (N=1,356) received screening forms; 642 (47%) completed the form. Of the respondents, 333 (52%) were eligible, and 161 completed the survey (48%). Main outcome measures: Demographics of naturopathic physicians, development of treatment plans, CAM therapies used, perceived efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Results: Of those respondents screened, 497 (77%) had provided naturopathic care to women with breast cancer, and 402 (63%) had treated women with breast cancer in the previous 12 months. Naturopaths who were women were more likely than men to treat breast cancer (P or = .004).

Design: Prospective study. Setting: Medical school-affiliated infertility center. Patient(s): Seventeen infertile patients undergoing routine gynecoradiologic investigation as part of an initial infertility workup. Intervention(s): The initial hysterosalpinography was performed with a commercially available uterine catheter that seals off the uterine cavity before injection of contrast. If intrauterine adhesions were diagnosed, an immediate attempt at lysis was made using the catheter's balloon tip or hysteroscopic scissors, which were inserted through the main port of the catheter. The procedures were carried out using a paracervical block or IV analgesia. Main outcome measure(s): Normal uterine cavity after lysis of intrauterine adhesions. Result(s): Seventeen patients underwent lysis of intrauterine adhesions. In 13 patients (9 mild, 3 moderate, and 1 severe), the adhesions were lysed successfully (81.2%). Among those, nine procedures were performed with the balloon and four with scissors. In 4 cases (2 moderate and 2 severe), lysis of adhesions was only partially successful. These procedures had to be abandoned prematurely because of patient discomfort before attempting the use of scissors (n = 1), extravasation of dye into the myometrium making visualization difficult (n = 1), and thick, fibrotic adhesions that were resistant to scissors (n = 2). Conclusion(s): In-office lysis of intrauterine adhesions under gynecoradiologic control can be carried out safely in the majority of patients, using minimally invasive techniques. The potential cost savings in comparison with endoscopic procedures, which require utilization of expensive operating room time, are especially relevant in today's cost-conscious managed care environment.

Previous meta-analytic reviews of CBT interventions in this population have not investigated potential moderators of treatment efficacy specific to this type of therapy. Method: Forty randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of CBT during pregnancy and the first year postpartum were included in the meta-analyses. Change in depressive symptoms from pre-treatment to post-treatment was assessed in both treatment and prevention trials, and the difference in prevalence of postpartum depressive episodes was assessed in prevention trials. Characteristics of included studies, interventions and samples were assessed as potential moderators of effect sizes. Results: CBT interventions resulted in significant reductions in depressive symptoms compared to control conditions in both treatment and prevention studies. In prevention studies, individuals who received CBT had significantly lower rates of postpartum depressive episodes compared to control conditions. In both treatment and prevention trials, interventions initiated during the postpartum period were more effective than antenatal interventions. In prevention trials, individually-administered treatments were more effective than group interventions and greater reductions in depressive symptoms were found in studies that included higher proportions of nonwhite, single, and multiparous participants.

The results showed some evidence for relaxing effects of L-theanine during the baseline condition on the tranquil-troubled subscale of the VAMS. Alprazolam did not exert any anxiolytic effects in comparison with the placebo on any of the measures during the relaxed state. Neither L-theanine nor alprazalam had any significant anxiolytic effects during the experimentally induced anxiety state.

L -theanine at doses lower and higher than these may also show promising therapeutic potential; however, a more thorough investigation through randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover clinical trials are necessary to elucidate its effects for longer periods, providing further insights for meta-analyses and the development of recommendation guidelines. Additionally, animal studies investigating a higher dosage, its combination with other pharmacological compounds and associated metabolic comorbidities are recommended, as cases of hepatotoxicity associated with the consumption of green tea extract have been reported.",0.5662020444869995
131,2021,21208586,Can l-theanine supplements reduce stress and anxiety?,l-theanine supplements anxiety,1.0,"Objective: L-theanine is a unique amino acid present almost exclusively in the tea plant. It possesses neuroprotective, mood-enhancing, and relaxation properties. This is a first study designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of L-theanine augmentation of antipsychotic treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Method: 60 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated in an 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. 400 mg/d of L-theanine was added to ongoing antipsychotic treatment from February 2006 until October 2008. The outcome measures were the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) for neurocognitive functioning, and additional measures of general functioning, side effects, and quality of life. Results: 40 patients completed the study protocol. Compared with placebo, L-theanine augmentation was associated with reduction of anxiety (P = .015; measured by the HARS scale) and positive (P = .009) and general psychopathology (P .001) scores (measured by the PANSS 3-dimensional model). According to the 5-dimension model of psychopathology, L-theanine produced significant reductions on PANSS positive (P = .004) and activation factor (P = .006) scores compared to placebo. The effect sizes (Cohen d) for these differences ranged from modest to moderate (0.09-0.39). PANSS negative and CANTAB task scores, general functioning, side effect, and quality of life measures were not affected by L-theanine augmentation. L-theanine was found to be a safe and well-tolerated medication. Conclusions: L-theanine augmentation of antipsychotic therapy can ameliorate positive, activation, and anxiety symptoms in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients. Further long-term studies of L-theanine are needed to substantiate the clinically significant benefits of L-theanine augmentation.",0.26940402388572693
131,2021,18296328,Can l-theanine supplements reduce stress and anxiety?,l-theanine supplements anxiety,1.0,"Tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world after water. Tea is known to be a rich source of flavonoid antioxidants. However tea also contains a unique amino acid, L-theanine that may modulate aspects of brain function in humans. Evidence from human electroencephalograph (EEG) studies show that it has a direct effect on the brain (Juneja et al. Trends in Food Science &amp; Tech 1999;10;199-204). L-theanine significantly increases activity in the alpha frequency band which indicates that it relaxes the mind without inducing drowsiness. However, this effect has only been established at higher doses than that typically found in a cup of black tea (approximately 20mg). The aim of the current research was to establish this effect at more realistic dietary levels. EEG was measured in healthy, young participants at baseline and 45, 60, 75, 90 and 105 minutes after ingestion of 50mg L-theanine (n=16) or placebo (n=19). Participants were resting with their eyes closed during EEG recording. There was a greater increase in alpha activity across time in the L-theanine condition (relative to placebo (p+0.05). A second study replicated this effect in participants engaged in passive activity. These data indicate that L-theanine, at realistic dietary levels, has a significant effect on the general state of mental alertness or arousal. Furthermore, alpha activity is known to play an important role in critical aspects of attention, and further research is therefore focussed on understanding the effect of L-theanine on attentional processes.",0.2561092972755432
131,2021,23107346,Can l-theanine supplements reduce stress and anxiety?,l-theanine supplements anxiety,1.0,"Background: L-theanine, an amino acid contained in green tea leaves, is known to block the binding of L-glutamic acid to glutamate receptors in the brain, and has been considered to cause anti-stress effects by inhibiting cortical neuron excitation. Both L-theanine and caffeine, which green tea contains, have been highlighted for their beneficial effects on cognition and mood. Methods: In this study, we investigated the effects of orally administered L-theanine or caffeine on mental task performance and physiological activities under conditions of physical or psychological stress in humans. Fourteen participants each underwent three separate trials, in which they orally took either L-theanine + placebo, caffeine + placebo, or placebo only. Results: The results after the mental tasks showed that L-theanine significantly inhibited the blood-pressure increases in a high-response group, which consisted of participants whose blood pressure increased more than average by a performance of a mental task after placebo intake. Caffeine tended to have a similar but smaller inhibition of the blood-pressure increases caused by the mental tasks. The result of the Profile of Mood States after the mental tasks also showed that L-theanine reduced the Tension-Anxiety scores as compared with placebo intake. Conclusions: The findings above denote that L-theanine not only reduces anxiety but also attenuates the blood-pressure increase in high-stress-response adults.",0.3753306567668915
131,2021,30707852,Can l-theanine supplements reduce stress and anxiety?,l-theanine supplements anxiety,1.0,"Context: γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter and it is well established that activation of GABA A receptors favours sleep. l-Theanine, a naturally occurring amino acid first discovered in green tea, is a well-known anti-anxiety supplement with proven relaxation benefits. Objective: This study investigated the potential synergistic sleep enhancement effect of GABA/l-theanine mixture. Materials and methods: Pentobarbital-induced sleep test was applied to find proper concentration for sleep-promoting effect in ICR mice. Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis was performed to investigate total sleeping time and sleep quality in normal SD rats and caffeine-induced awareness model. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to investigate whether the sleep-promoting mechanism of GABA/l-theanine mixture involved transcriptional processes. Results: GABA/l-theanine mixture (100/20 mg/kg) showed a decrease in sleep latency (20.7 and 14.9%) and an increase in sleep duration (87.3 and 26.8%) compared to GABA or theanine alone. GABA/l-theanine mixture led to a significant increase in rapid eye movement (REM) (99.6%) and non-REM (NREM) (20.6%) compared to controls. The use of GABA/l-theanine mixture rather than GABA or l-theanine alone restored to normal levels sleep time and quality in the arousal animal model. The administration of GABA/l-theanine led to increased expression of GABA and the glutamate GluN1 receptor subunit. Conclusions: GABA/l-theanine mixture has a positive synergistic effect on sleep quality and duration as compared to the GABA or l-theanine alone. The increase in GABA receptor and GluN1 expression is attributed to the potential neuromodulatory properties of GABA/l-theanine combination, which seems to affect sleep behaviour.",0.6237934231758118

Design: An in vitro study determined the temperature that inactivated rhinovirus: a temperature of 43 degrees C lasting at least 1 hour was needed. We then conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized in vivo study. Setting: The virology laboratory and the outpatient department of the Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic Foundation. Patients: Sixty-eight Cleveland Clinic employee volunteers with symptoms of the common cold at the time of enrollment. Intervention: A single 60-minute treatment was given to the volunteers. The steam treatment group (n = 32) received 40 L/min of heated saturated air that raised the intranasal temperature to 43 degrees C. The placebo group (n = 36) received 2 L/min of ambient air at 20 degrees C to 24 degrees C. Main outcome measures: Subjective symptom scores for nasal congestion, nasal drainage, and sneezing and objective measures of nasal resistance were studied during a 7-day follow-up observation period. Results: There were no significant differences in daily symptom scores between the groups (P = .59 to .83). The only statistically significant differences between the groups were lower nasal resistances at baseline in the steam group (P = .04) and percent improvement in nasal resistance favoring the placebo group on day 7 (P = .01). However, these differences were of questionable clinical significance.

The effect of steam inhalation on RV shedding by infected volunteers was examined in this study. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Volunteers experimentally infected with RV were treated with machine-generated humidified air, which was either hot (active) or at room temperature (placebo). Viral shedding was assessed over the 4 days following treatment. Setting: Local hotel. Participants: Twenty volunteers from the university community who were susceptible to the challenge virus. Intervention: Two 30-minute intranasal treatments, the first at 24 hours after inoculation and the second at 48 hours. The temperature of active vapor was 42 degrees C to 44 degrees C and of placebo vapor was 22 degrees C. Main outcome measures: Viral titers in nasal washings on each of 5 days following inoculation. Results: Mean viral titers prior to the first treatment were 10(1.7) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter in the active group and 10(1.5) in the placebo group. Mean titers for the next 4 days were 10(1.7), and 10(1.7), 10(1.2), and 10(0.9)/mL in the active group and 10(1.8), 10(1.9), 10(1.6), and 10(0.7)/mL in the placebo group (no significant difference).

Treatment consisted of two 20-minute sessions, during which the patient inhaled saturated, hot (42 degrees to 44 degrees C) air through the nose. The subjective response was recorded by each patient during the week following treatment on a daily symptom score card. Nasal patency was determined before treatment, the following day, and 1 week later by measuring peak nasal expiratory and inspiratory air flow. Highly reproducible results were obtained by using these objective methods. Steam inhalation resulted in alleviation of cold symptoms and increased nasal patency in a significantly higher percentage of patients in the actively treated group than in the placebo-treated group.

Search strategy: We searched MEDLINE with MeSH headings: common cold, rhinopharyngitis, inhalation, steam, heated vapour, rhinothermy, till July 1999. EMBASE, Current Contents, review articles, cross references were also searched. Attempts were also made to contact the manufacturers for any unpublished data. Selection criteria: Randomized trials using heated water vapour in a standardized way in patients with the common cold or volunteers with experimental induction of rhinovirus infection were included in the review. Data collection and analysis: All the articles retrieved were initially subjected to a review for inclusion / exclusion criteria. Review articles, editorials, abstracts with inadequate outcome description were excluded. Studies selected for inclusion were subjected to a methodological assessment. Main results: The results of a systematic review of six trials with 319 participants, support the use of warm vapour inhalations in the common cold in terms of relief of symptoms (Odds Ratio with 95 % CI 0.31, 0.16-0.60, Relative risk 0.56, 0.4-0.79). Results on symptom score indices were equivocal. None of the studies demonstrated a worsening of clinical symptom scores. One study demonstrated increased nasal resistance one week after steam inhalation in contrast to an earlier study which showed improvement in the nasal resistance. There was no evidence of decreased viral shedding measured by virus isolation in the nasal secretions or measurement of viral titres in nasal washings among treatment group. The rhinovirus titres in the nasal washings from the treatment group were the same as those of the placebo group on day one prior to the treatment and on all four days after the treatment. The area under curve was also similar in the placebo and treatment groups for titres of virus in the nasal washings as were the average viral titres across five days of follow up, the maximum values after treatment, and viral shedding velocity i.e. amount of virus shed per day. Minor side effects due to thermal stress were reported in all the studies. Reviewer's conclusions: Three trials demonstrated beneficial effects on the symptoms of the common cold. One study from Israel showed a decrease in nasal resistance measured by peak nasal expiratory and inspiratory flow rate. Studies done in North America failed to show any objective improvement in outcome measures with the study intervention.

132,2021,22962927,Does inhaling steam help treat common cold?,inhaling steam common cold,0.0,"The common cold, or upper respiratory tract infection, is one of the leading reasons for physician visits. Generally caused by viruses, the common cold is treated symptomatically. Antibiotics are not effective in children or adults. In children, there is a potential for harm and no benefits with over-the-counter cough and cold medications; therefore, they should not be used in children younger than four years. Other commonly used medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, oral prednisolone, and Echinacea, also are ineffective in children. Products that improve symptoms in children include vapor rub, zinc sulfate, Pelargonium sidoides (geranium) extract, and buckwheat honey. Prophylactic probiotics, zinc sulfate, nasal saline irrigation, and the herbal preparation Chizukit reduce the incidence of colds in children. For adults, antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, codeine, nasal saline irrigation, Echinacea angustifolia preparations, and steam inhalation are ineffective at relieving cold symptoms. Pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, inhaled ipratropium, and zinc (acetate or gluconate) modestly reduce the severity and duration of symptoms for adults. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and some herbal preparations, including Echinacea purpurea, improve symptoms in adults. Prophylactic use of garlic may decrease the frequency of colds in adults, but has no effect on duration of symptoms. Hand hygiene reduces the spread of viruses that cause cold illnesses.

We also searched World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (8 March 2017) and ClinicalTrials.gov (8 March 2017) as well as reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials using heated water vapour in participants with the common cold or experimentally induced common cold were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Three review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion of potential studies identified from the search. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram. We used a data collection form for study characteristics and outcome data that was developed and used for previous versions of this review. Two review authors independently extracted data, and a third review author resolved any disagreements. We used Review Manager 5 software to analyse data. Main results: We included six trials from five publications involving a total of 387 participants. We included no new studies in this 2017 update. The 'Risk of bias' assessment suggested an unclear risk of bias in the domain of randomisation and a low risk of bias in performance, detection, attrition, and reporting.It was uncertain whether heated, humidified air provides symptomatic relief for the common cold, as the fixed-effect analysis showed evidence of an effect (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.56; 2 studies, 149 participants), but the random-effects analysis showed no significant difference in the results (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.95). There is an argument for using either form of analysis. No studies demonstrated an exacerbation of clinical symptom scores. One study conducted in the USA demonstrated worsened nasal resistance, but an earlier Israeli study showed improvement. One study examined viral shedding in nasal washings, finding no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.19).

There was significant heterogeneity in the effects of heated, humidified air on different outcomes, therefore we graded the quality of the evidence as low. Some studies reported minor adverse events (including discomfort or irritation of the nose).

133,2021,24026850,Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,exercise depression,1.0,"Background: Depression is a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Depression is commonly treated with antidepressants and/or psychological therapy, but some people may prefer alternative approaches such as exercise. There are a number of theoretical reasons why exercise may improve depression. This is an update of an earlier review first published in 2009. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of depression in adults compared with no treatment or a comparator intervention. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) to 13 July 2012. This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years); MEDLINE (1950 to date); EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also searched www.controlled-trials.com, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. No date or language restrictions were applied to the search.We conducted an additional search of the CCDANCTR up to 1st March 2013 and any potentially eligible trials not already included are listed as 'awaiting classification.' Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials in which exercise (defined according to American College of Sports Medicine criteria) was compared to standard treatment, no treatment or a placebo treatment, pharmacological treatment, psychological treatment or other active treatment in adults (aged 18 and over) with depression, as defined by trial authors. We included cluster trials and those that randomised individuals. We excluded trials of postnatal depression. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors extracted data on primary and secondary outcomes at the end of the trial and end of follow-up (if available). We calculated effect sizes for each trial using Hedges' g method and a standardised mean difference (SMD) for the overall pooled effect, using a random-effects model risk ratio for dichotomous data. Where trials used a number of different tools to assess depression, we included the main outcome measure only in the meta-analysis. Where trials provided several 'doses' of exercise, we used data from the biggest 'dose' of exercise, and performed sensitivity analyses using the lower 'dose'. We performed subgroup analyses to explore the influence of method of diagnosis of depression (diagnostic interview or cut-off point on scale), intensity of exercise and the number of sessions of exercise on effect sizes. Two authors performed the 'Risk of bias' assessments. Our sensitivity analyses explored the influence of study quality on outcome. Main results: Thirty-nine trials (2326 participants) fulfilled our inclusion criteria, of which 37 provided data for meta-analyses. There were multiple sources of bias in many of the trials; randomisation was adequately concealed in 14 studies, 15 used intention-to-treat analyses and 12 used blinded outcome assessors.For the 35 trials (1356 participants) comparing exercise with no treatment or a control intervention, the pooled SMD for the primary outcome of depression at the end of treatment was -0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.81 to -0.42), indicating a moderate clinical effect. There was moderate heterogeneity (I² = 63%).When we included only the six trials (464 participants) with adequate allocation concealment, intention-to-treat analysis and blinded outcome assessment, the pooled SMD for this outcome was not statistically significant (-0.18, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.11). Pooled data from the eight trials (377 participants) providing long-term follow-up data on mood found a small effect in favour of exercise (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.03).Twenty-nine trials reported acceptability of treatment, three trials reported quality of life, none reported cost, and six reported adverse events.For acceptability of treatment (assessed by number of drop-outs during the intervention), the risk ratio was 1.00 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.04).Seven trials compared exercise with psychological therapy (189 participants), and found no significant difference (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.26). Four trials (n = 300) compared exercise with pharmacological treatment and found no significant difference (SMD -0.11, -0.34, 0.12). One trial (n = 18) reported that exercise was more effective than bright light therapy (MD -6.40, 95% CI -10.20 to -2.60).For each trial that was included, two authors independently assessed for sources of bias in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration 'Risk of bias' tool. In exercise trials, there are inherent difficulties in blinding both those receiving the intervention and those delivering the intervention. Many trials used participant self-report rating scales as a method for post-intervention analysis, which also has the potential to bias findings. Authors' conclusions: Exercise is moderately more effective than a control intervention for reducing symptoms of depression, but analysis of methodologically robust trials only shows a smaller effect in favour of exercise. When compared to psychological or pharmacological therapies, exercise appears to be no more effective, though this conclusion is based on a few small trials.",0.25336751341819763
133,2021,11020092,Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,exercise depression,1.0,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the status of 156 adult volunteers with major depressive disorder (MDD) 6 months after completion of a study in which they were randomly assigned to a 4-month course of aerobic exercise, sertraline therapy, or a combination of exercise and sertraline. Methods: The presence and severity of depression were assessed by clinical interview using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and by self-report using the Beck Depression Inventory. Assessments were performed at baseline, after 4 months of treatment, and 6 months after treatment was concluded (ie, after 10 months). Results: After 4 months patients in all three groups exhibited significant improvement; the proportion of remitted participants (ie, those who no longer met diagnostic criteria for MDD and had an HRSD score 8) was comparable across the three treatment conditions. After 10 months, however, remitted subjects in the exercise group had significantly lower relapse rates (p = .01) than subjects in the medication group. Exercising on one's own during the follow-up period was associated with a reduced probability of depression diagnosis at the end of that period (odds ratio = 0.49, p = .0009). Conclusions: Among individuals with MDD, exercise therapy is feasible and is associated with significant therapeutic benefit, especially if exercise is continued over time.",0.23224972188472748

Depression is commonly treated with antidepressants and/or psychotherapy, but some people may prefer alternative approaches such as exercise. There are a number of theoretical reasons why exercise may improve depression. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of depression. Search strategy: We searched Medline, Embase, Sports Discus, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for eligible studies in March 2007. In addition, we hand-searched several relevant journals, contacted experts in the field, searched bibliographies of retrieved articles, and performed citation searches of identified studies. We also searched www.controlled-trials.com in May 2008. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials in which exercise was compared to standard treatment, no treatment or a placebo treatment in adults (aged 18 and over) with depression, as defined by trial authors. We excluded trials of post-natal depression. Data collection and analysis: We calculated effect sizes for each trial using Cohen's method and a standardised mean difference (SMD) for the overall pooled effect, using a random effects model. Where trials used a number of different tools to assess depression, we included the main outcome measure only in the meta-analysis. Main results: Twenty-eight trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria, of which 25 provided data for meta-analyses. Randomisation was adequately concealed in a minority of studies, most did not use intention to treat analyses and most used self-reported symptoms as outcome measures. For the 23 trials (907 participants) comparing exercise with no treatment or a control intervention, the pooled SMD was -0.82 (95% CI -1.12, -0.51), indicating a large clinical effect. However, when we included only the three trials with adequate allocation concealment and intention to treat analysis and blinded outcome assessment, the pooled SMD was -0.42 (95% CI -0.88, 0.03) i.e. moderate, non-significant effect. The effect of exercise was not significantly different from that of cognitive therapy. There was insufficient data to determine risks and costs. Authors' conclusions: Exercise seems to improve depressive symptoms in people with a diagnosis of depression, but when only methodologically robust trials are included, the effect sizes are only moderate and not statistically significant. Further, more methodologically robust trials should be performed to obtain more accurate estimates of effect sizes, and to determine risks and costs.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from a recent Cochrane review and searches of major electronic databases from 01/2013 to 08/2015. We included RCTs of exercise interventions in people with depression (including those with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or ratings on depressive symptoms), comparing exercise versus control conditions. A random effects meta-analysis calculating the standardized mean difference (SMD, 95% confidence interval; CI), meta-regressions, trim and fill and fail-safe n analyses were conducted. Twenty-five RCTs were included comparing exercise versus control comparison groups, including 9 examining participants with MDD. Overall, exercise had a large and significant effect on depression (SMD adjusted for publication bias = 1.11 (95% CI 0.79-1.43)) with a fail-safe number of 1057. Most adjusted analyses suggested publication bias led to an underestimated SMD. Larger effects were found for interventions in MDD, utilising aerobic exercise, at moderate and vigorous intensities, in a supervised and unsupervised format. In MDD, larger effects were found for moderate intensity, aerobic exercise, and interventions supervised by exercise professionals. Exercise has a large and significant antidepressant effect in people with depression (including MDD). Previous meta-analyses may have underestimated the benefits of exercise due to publication bias.

We also searched www.controlled-trials.com in November 2010. The CCDAN Group searched its Specialised Register in June 2011 and potentially eligible trials were listed as 'awaiting assessment'. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials in which exercise was compared to standard treatment, no treatment or a placebo treatment in adults (aged 18 and over) with depression, as defined by trial authors. We excluded trials of postnatal depression. Data collection and analysis: For this update, two review authors extracted data on outcomes at the end of the trial. We used these data to calculate effect sizes for each trial using Hedges' g method and a standardised mean difference (SMD) for the overall pooled effect, using a random-effects model. Where trials used a number of different tools to assess depression, we included the main outcome measure only in the meta-analysis.

Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a submaximal Vo 2 test, and neuroimaging assessments were conducted using a Siemans MAGNETOM 7-Tesla magnetic resonance scanner at the University of Pittsburgh. Results: Attrition was 38% and 14% for the medication and exercise groups, respectively. Attendance was 91% for the exercise intervention.

Meta-analytic evidence indicates that volumetric reductions in the hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, striatum, and amygdala, as well as compromised white matter integrity are frequently observed in depressed adults. Exercise has shown promise as an effective treatment for depression, but few studies have attempted to characterize or identify the neural mechanisms of these effects. In this review, we examined the overlap between structural brain abnormalities in depression and the effects of exercise on brain structure in adults, to highlight possible neural mechanisms that may mediate the positive effects of exercise on depressive symptoms. The prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum emerged as structural neural markers that may serve as targets for exercise-based treatments for depression.

In line, intervention studies describe an anxiolytic and antidepressive activity of exercise in healthy subjects and patients. However, the majority of published studies have substantial methodological shortcomings. The aim of this paper is to critically review the currently available literature with respect to (1) the association of physical activity, exercise and the prevalence and incidence of depression and anxiety disorders and (2) the potential therapeutic activity of exercise training in patients with depression or anxiety disorders. Although the association of physical activity and the prevalence of mental disorders, including depression and anxiety disorders have been repeatedly described, only few studies examined the association of physical activity and mental disorders prospectively. Reduced incidence rates of depression and (some) anxiety disorders in exercising subjects raise the question whether exercise may be used in the prevention of some mental disorders. Besides case series and small uncontrolled studies, recent well controlled studies suggest that exercise training may be clinically effective, at least in major depression and panic disorder. Although, the evidence for positive effects of exercise and exercise training on depression and anxiety is growing, the clinical use, at least as an adjunct to established treatment approaches like psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy, is still at the beginning. Further studies on the clinical effects of exercise, interaction with standard treatment approaches and details on the optimal type, intensity, frequency and duration may further support the clinical administration in patients. Furthermore, there is a lack of knowledge on how to best deal with depression and anxiety related symptoms which hinder patients to participate and benefit from exercise training.",0.3726145327091217

However, the extent to which exercise training may reduce depressive symptoms in older patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) has not been systematically evaluated. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of an aerobic exercise program compared with standard medication (ie, antidepressants) for treatment of MDD in older patients, we conducted a 16-week randomized controlled trial. Methods: One hundred fifty-six men and women with MDD (age, &gt; or = 50 years) were assigned randomly to a program of aerobic exercise, antidepressants (sertraline hydrochloride), or combined exercise and medication. Subjects underwent comprehensive evaluations of depression, including the presence and severity of MDD using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores before and after treatment. Secondary outcome measures included aerobic capacity, life satisfaction, self-esteem, anxiety, and dysfunctional cognitions. Results: After 16 weeks of treatment, the groups did not differ statistically on HAM-D or BDI scores (P = .67); adjustment for baseline levels of depression yielded an essentially identical result. Growth curve models revealed that all groups exhibited statistically and clinically significant reductions on HAM-D and BDI scores. However, patients receiving medication alone exhibited the fastest initial response; among patients receiving combination therapy, those with less severe depressive symptoms initially showed a more rapid response than those with initially more severe depressive symptoms. Conclusions: An exercise training program may be considered an alternative to antidepressants for treatment of depression in older persons. Although antidepressants may facilitate a more rapid initial therapeutic response than exercise, after 16 weeks of treatment exercise was equally effective in reducing depression among patients with MDD.",0.22610895335674286

The development and registration of new pesticides has become so costly that many chemical companies are unwilling to pursue it and health-care providers now face a serious lack of new commercial pediculicides. Many infested people resort to using ""home-remedy"" approaches that have not been scientifically tested. In this article, we examined the potential value of six purportedly effective ""home remedies"" (vinegar, isopropyl alcohol, olive oil, mayonnaise, melted butter, and petroleum jelly) to treat head louse infestations and the likelihood of drowning lice by water submersion. Results indicated that only the application of petroleum jelly caused significant louse mortality but no treatment prevented lice from laying eggs. Most home remedy products did little to kill eggs, despite prolonged exposure. Petroleum jelly caused the greatest egg mortality, allowing only 6% to hatch. It was extremely difficult to drown lice, despite extended periods (i.e., 8 hr) of water submersion, suggesting that killing lice by depriving them of oxygen is inefficient. None of the home remedy products we surveyed was an effective means of louse control. This suggests that when treatment failure occurs, an increased amount of time and effort should be focused on alternative chemical pediculicides and/or manual louse removal (i.e., combing) rather than using any of these products.",0.06306612491607666
135,2021,10937452,Can applying mayonnaise help get rid of lice?,mayonnaise lice treatment,0.0,"Head louse infestations (pediculosis) are prevalent worldwide. In developed countries, the infestation rate of 4- to 13-year-old children remains high despite preventive efforts. This is due to the existence of numerous ineffective pediculicides, the incorrect use of the effective agents, toxicological concerns and the development of louse strains resistant to insecticides. One of the most effective tools for the prevention and control of lice is the louse comb, which should be used regularly for the detection of living lice at an early stage of infestation, and as an accessory to any treatment method to remove living and dead lice. The louse comb can also be used systematically for the treatment of infestations, for confirmation that treatment with pediculicides has been successful, and for the removal of nits (dead eggs or egg shells). Most pediculicides are only partially ovicidal. Therefore, 10 days after beginning treatment with any antilouse product, the scalp of the child should be examined. If no living lice are found, the treatment should be discontinued. If living lice are still present, treatment should be continued with a product containing a different active ingredient. Suffocating agents such as olive, soya, sunflower and corn oils, hair gels and mayonnaise are able to kill a significant number of lice only if they are applied in liberal quantities for more than 12 hours. However, they lubricate the hair and therefore may facilitate combing and removing lice and eggs from the scalp. Nits may remain glued on the hair for at least 6 months, even after a successful treatment, and lead to a false positive diagnosis of louse infestation. If nits are seen on the hair, the child should be examined, but treatment should be initiated only if living lice are found. Formulations containing 5% acetic acid or 8% formic acid, as well as acid shampoos (pH 4.5 to 5.5) and conditioners, in combination with a louse comb, can be helpful for removing nits. There is no conclusive evidence that using essential oils to repel lice is effective. Regular examination of the child's head using a louse comb is the best measure to detect re-infestation at an early stage. Educating caregivers, nurses and teachers about louse biology, epidemiology, prevention and control is of paramount importance. The psychological effect of an infestation with lice is significant and often associated with anxiety and fear.

A search of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration website and labels of approved products were reviewed. A marked decline in the effectiveness of permethrin and synergized pyrethrins was found, probably because of resistance arising from widespread and indiscriminate use, and the emergence of knockdown resistance mutations. The potential toxicity of lindane in the setting of readily available, safer, and more effective alternatives, should limit its use. Prescription products shown to be safe and effective with a single application, without nit combing, are topical ivermectin, malathion, and spinosad, whereas benzyl alcohol requires two applications. Home remedies such as mayonnaise, and essential oils, have not been demonstrated to be safe or effective, and may carry potential for severe adverse events.

This protein is a transmembrane serine protease that plays an essential role in down-regulating hepcidin, the key regulator of iron homeostasis. Hallmarks of this disease are microcytic hypochromic anemia, low transferrin saturation and normal/high serum hepcidin values. The anemia appears in the post-natal period, although in some cases it is only diagnosed in adulthood. The disease is refractory to oral iron treatment but shows a slow response to intravenous iron injections and partial correction of the anemia. To date, 40 different Matriptase-2 mutations have been reported, affecting all the functional domains of the large ectodomain of the protein. In vitro experiments on transfected cells suggest that Matriptase-2 cleaves Hemojuvelin, a major regulator of hepcidin expression and that this function is altered in this genetic form of anemia. In contrast to the low/undetectable hepcidin levels observed in acquired iron deficiency, in patients with Matriptase-2 deficiency, serum hepcidin is inappropriately high for the low iron status and accounts for the absent/delayed response to oral iron treatment. A challenge for the clinicians and pediatricians is the recognition of the disorder among iron deficiency and other microcytic anemias commonly found in pediatric patients. The current treatment of iron refractory iron deficiency anemia is based on parenteral iron administration; in the future, manipulation of the hepcidin pathway with the aim of suppressing it might become an alternative therapeutic approach.",0.5169256329536438

136,2021,31413088,Can eating dates help manage iron deficiency anemia?,dates iron deficiency anemia,1.0,"In iron-depleted women without anemia, oral iron supplements induce an increase in serum hepcidin (SHep) that persists for 24 hours, decreasing iron absorption from supplements given later on the same or next day. Consequently, iron absorption from supplements is highest if iron is given on alternate days. Whether this dosing schedule is also beneficial in women with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) given high-dose iron supplements is uncertain. The primary objective of this study was to assess whether, in women with IDA, alternate-day administration of 100 and 200 mg iron increases iron absorption compared to consecutive-day iron administration. Secondary objectives were to correlate iron absorption with SHep and iron status parameters. We performed a cross-over iron absorption study in women with IDA (n=19; median hemoglobin 11.5 mg/dL; mean serum ferritin 10 mg/L) who received either 100 or 200 mg iron as ferrous sulfate given at 8 AM on days 2, 3 and 5 labeled with stable iron isotopes 57Fe, 58Fe and 54Fe; after a 16-day incorporation period, the other labeled dose was given at 8 AM on days 23, 24 and 26 (days 2, 3 and 5 of the second period). Iron absorption on days 2 and 3 (consecutive) and day 5 (alternate) was assessed by measuring erythrocyte isotope incorporation. For both doses, SHep was higher on day 3 than on day 2 ( P 0.001) or day 5 ( P 0.01) with no significant difference between days 2 and 5. Similarly, for both doses, fractional iron absorption (FIA) on days 2 and 5 was 40-50% higher than on day 3 ( P 0.001), while absorption on day 2 did not differ significantly from day 5. There was no significant difference in the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects comparing the two iron doses ( P =0.105). Alternate day dosing of oral iron supplements in anemic women may be preferable because it sharply increases FIA. If needed, to provide the same total amount of iron with alternate day dosing, twice the daily target dose should be given on alternate days, as total iron absorption from a single dose of 200 mg given on alternate days was approximately twice that from 100 mg given on consecutive days ( P 0.001).

These studies, however, have primarily involved nonanemic, iron-replete individuals. The effect of the drug has not been studied in patients with established iron deficiency, and to our knowledge the patients presented here are the first of their kind to be reported. Our observations support the probability that the profound hypochlorhydria induced by omeprazole may indeed impair the optimal absorption of orally administered iron in iron-deficient individuals, precluding them from obtaining therapeutically adequate amounts to establish the positive balance necessary for the resolution of anemia and the replenishment of stores. The possible explanations for this phenomenon are also discussed.",0.09017112851142883
136,2021,23766655,Can eating dates help manage iron deficiency anemia?,dates iron deficiency anemia,1.0,"Iron deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia worldwide, caused by poor iron intake, chronic blood loss, or impaired absorption. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are increasingly likely to have iron deficiency anemia, with an estimated prevalence of 36%-76%. Detection of iron deficiency is problematic as outward signs and symptoms are not always present. Iron deficiency can have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life, necessitating prompt management and treatment. Effective treatment includes identifying and treating the underlying cause and initiating iron replacement therapy with either oral or intravenous iron. Numerous formulations for oral iron are available, with ferrous fumarate, sulfate, and gluconate being the most commonly prescribed. Available intravenous formulations include iron dextran, iron sucrose, ferric gluconate, and ferumoxytol. Low-molecular weight iron dextran and iron sucrose have been shown to be safe, efficacious, and effective in a host of gastrointestinal disorders. Ferumoxytol is the newest US Food and Drug Administration-approved intravenous iron therapy, indicated for iron deficiency anemia in adults with chronic kidney disease. Ferumoxytol is also being investigated in Phase 3 studies for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients without chronic kidney disease, including subgroups with IBD. A review of the efficacy and safety of iron replacement in IBD, therapeutic considerations, and recommendations for the practicing gastroenterologist are presented.",0.477070152759552

Although the two can occur together, anemia in HF is often not caused by iron deficiency, and iron deficiency can be present without causing anemia. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents have been investigated extensively in the past few years and might be of benefit in patients with HF and anemia. However, concerns have arisen regarding the safety of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients with chronic kidney disease and so the results of a large mortality trial are eagerly awaited to provide information on safety in patients with HF. Iron supplementation or replacement is a much older treatment option for patients with HF and anemia, but questions about the safety of intravenous iron, and absorption problems with oral formulations have prevented its widespread use to date. In the past few years, however, new data on the importance of iron deficiency in HF have become available, and a number of studies with intravenous iron have shown promising results. Therefore, this treatment approach is likely to become an attractive option for patients with HF and iron deficiency, both with and without anemia.",0.07152571529150009

136,2021,11930010,Can eating dates help manage iron deficiency anemia?,dates iron deficiency anemia,1.0,"We recently reported the hemochromatosis-like phenotype observed in our Usf2 knockout mice. In these mice, as in murine models of hemochromatosis and patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, iron accumulates in parenchymal cells (in particular, liver and pancreas), whereas the reticuloendothelial system is spared from this iron loading. We suggested that this phenotypic trait could be attributed to the absence, in the Usf2 knockout mice, of a secreted liver-specific peptide, hepcidin. We conjectured that the reverse situation, namely overexpression of hepcidin, might result in phenotypic traits of iron deficiency. This question was addressed by generating transgenic mice expressing hepcidin under the control of the liver-specific transthyretin promoter. We found that the majority of the transgenic mice were born with a pale skin and died within a few hours after birth. These transgenic animals had decreased body iron levels and presented severe microcytic hypochromic anemia. So far, three mosaic transgenic animals have survived. They were unequivocally identified by physical features, including reduced body size, pallor, hairless and crumpled skin. These pleiotropic effects were found to be associated with erythrocyte abnormalities, with marked anisocytosis, poikylocytosis and hypochromia, which are features characteristic of iron-deficiency anemia. These results strongly support the proposed role of hepcidin as a putative iron-regulatory hormone. The animal models devoid of hepcidin (the Usf2 knockout mice) or overexpressing the peptide (the transgenic mice presented in this paper) represent valuable tools for investigating iron homeostasis in vivo and for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of hepcidin action.",0.1150117814540863

This is because such injuries often leave residual fragments of foreign organic matter in the tissues, leading to troublesome secondary infections. This report details 1 year's experience with nine hand infections after fish bone injury in a busy regional hand surgery referral centre. There were five males and four females with an average age of 45 years. Radiographs taken on presentation in five patients revealed a radiolucent foreign body in only two patients. Two patients presented with a flexor tendon sheath infection, three with a pulp space infection, one with infection of the hypothenar space, one with a subungual infection, one with cellulitis of the dorsum of the hand and one with an abscess on the dorsum of the hand. Antibiotics were prescribed for six patients and all patients except the one with cellulitis of his hand underwent surgical débridement. A single surgical procedure was adequate in five patients. One patient with a hypothenar space infection only had the foreign body removed during the third surgical débridement. The two patients with flexor tendon sheath infections required ray amputation. Fish bones cause a number of different infections in the hand. A foreign body should always be sought even if not present on the radiograph.

Platelet aggregation is of critical importance in thrombotic events, and platelets play a major role in the aetiology of several CVD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of coffee drinking on platelet aggregation ex vivo, using caffeine as control. A crossover study was performed on ten healthy subjects. In two different sessions, subjects drank 200 ml coffee, containing 180 mg caffeine, or a capsule of caffeine (180 mg) with 200 ml water. Platelets were separated from plasma at baseline and 30 and 60 min after coffee drinking. Platelet aggregation was induced with three different agonists: collagen, arachidonic acid and ADP. Coffee drinking inhibited collagen (P 0.05 from baseline at time 30 min) and arachidonic acid (P 0.05 from baseline at time 60 min) induced platelet aggregation. Caffeine intake did not affect platelet aggregation induced by the three agonists. Coffee consumption induced a significant increase of platelet phenolic acids (likely present as glucuronate and sulphate derivatives), caffeic acid, the principal phenolic acid in coffee, raising from 0.3 (SEM 0.1) to 2.4 (SEM 0.6) ng/mg (P 0.01). Caffeine was not detectable in platelets. Coffee drinking decreases platelet aggregation, and induces a significant increase in phenolic acid platelet concentration. The antiplatelet effect of coffee is independent from caffeine and could be a result of the interaction of coffee phenolic acids with the intracellular signalling network leading to platelet aggregation.",0.1203300803899765

We present an unusual case of generalized taste change following an oral surgical procedure. The case is presented to enhance understanding of taste disorders and their relation to a localized traumatic event. Causative factors and management strategies are also reviewed. Taste change, encompassing loss (ageusia) or alteration (dysgeusia) of taste, is a rare phenomenon that may be idiopathic or may result from head trauma; endocrine, metabolic, sinus, autoimmune and salivary gland disorders; medication use; cancer treatment (radiation or chemotherapy); viral, bacterial and fungal infections; certain oral conditions; or peripheral nerve damage due to invasive procedures including dental interventions. Some factors thought to be responsible for nerve injuries associated with dental procedures are proximity of the chorda tympani nerve to the surgical site, retraction of the lingual flap, extraction of unerupted teeth especially third mandibular molars, and experience of the operator. Nerve damage may also be a result of local anesthetic injection due to direct needle trauma causing hemorrhage within the epineurium or a neurotoxic effect of the anesthetic. The sensation of taste is mediated by three cranial nerves: facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX) and vagus (X). The trigeminal nerve (V) provides general sensory innervation to a region that overlaps the areas served by these other cranial nerves (Table 1). Because of their anatomic proximity, the possibility exists for iatrogenic injury to the chorda tympani, lingual nerve or both during surgical procedures in the posterior mandible. This may result in irreversible gustatory deficits and somatosensory dysfunction. The purpose of this article is to review the possible causes and management of taste disorders.

The present study investigated the relationship between PCOS symptoms and sociosexuality in young women with a continuum of symptoms ranging from none to clinical levels. Given that unrestricted sociosexuality, or one's orientation toward uncommitted sexual activity, is associated with hyperandrogenism, we hypothesized that women experiencing more symptoms of PCOS, and a greater likelihood of androgen excess, would have a more unrestricted sociosexual orientation. Women completed questionnaires about PCOS symptoms, sociosexuality, and sexuality. Unrestricted sociosexuality, unrestricted desire, romantic interest in women, and masturbation frequency were all positively associated with PCOS symptoms (including male pattern hair growth). The sexuality scores were also higher in women who scored above (versus below) the cutoff on a self-report PCOS screening questionnaire. In addition, attraction to women was higher in participants reporting a past diagnosis of PCOS. The findings are in line with theories that androgens play a role in sociosexuality and sexual orientation. Future research should examine sociocultural explanations, and whether the continuum of PCOS symptoms (e.g., hirsutism) is a useful model for studying the effects of androgen exposure, hyperandrogenism, or androgen responsiveness on women's behavior.",0.18213674426078796

Inadequate treatment masking and reduced bioavailability of zinc from some formulations have been cited as influencing results. Objectives: To assess whether zinc (irrespective of the zinc salt or formulation used) is efficacious in reducing the incidence, severity and duration of common cold symptoms. In addition, we aimed to identify potential sources of heterogeneity in results obtained and to assess their clinical significance. Search methods: In this updated review, we searched CENTRAL (2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 2, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to January 2013), CINAHL (1981 to January 2013), Web of Science (1985 to January 2013), LILACS (1982 to January 2013), WHO ICTRP and clinicaltrials.gov. Selection criteria: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials using zinc for at least five consecutive days to treat, or for at least five months to prevent the common cold. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Main results: Five trials were identified in the updated searches in January 2013 and two of them did not meet our inclusion criteria. We included 16 therapeutic trials (1387 participants) and two preventive trials (394 participants). Intake of zinc was associated with a significant reduction in the duration (days) (mean difference (MD) -1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.72 to -0.34) (P = 0.003) (I(2) statistic = 89%) but not the severity of common cold symptoms (MD -1.06, 95% CI -2.36 to 0.23) (P = 0.11) (I(2) statistic = 84%). The proportion of participants who were symptomatic after seven days of treatment was significantly smaller (odds ratio (OR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.00) (P = 0.05) than those in the control, (I(2 )statistic = 75%). The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of developing a cold (IRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.88) (P = 0.006) (I(2) statistic = 88%), school absence (P = 0.0003) and prescription of antibiotics (P 0.00001) was lower in the zinc group. Overall adverse events (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.09) (P = 0.002), bad taste (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.11) (P 0.00001) and nausea (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.44 to 3.23) (P = 0.002) were higher in the zinc group. The very high heterogeneity means that the averaged estimates must be viewed with caution. Authors' conclusions: Zinc administered within 24 hours of onset of symptoms reduces the duration of common cold symptoms in healthy people but some caution is needed due to the heterogeneity of the data. As the zinc lozenges formulation has been widely studied and there is a significant reduction in the duration of cold at a dose of ≥ 75 mg/day, for those considering using zinc it would be best to use it at this dose throughout the cold. Regarding prophylactic zinc supplementation, currently no firm recommendation can be made because of insufficient data.

From four electronic databases, 660 identified studies were screened and data were extracted from 20 studies (zinc, 10; vitamin D, 8; and vitamins A and E, 2). The quality of selected studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and certainty in the outcomes was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. The review found that micronutrients supplementation, except vitamin C, may not prevent cold incidence or reduce symptom severity among healthy adults. However, zinc supplementation was observed to potentially reduce cold duration by 2.25 days (when zinc is provided singly, 95% CI: -3.39, -1.12).

Design: Meta-analysis. Setting: Placebo-controlled zinc lozenge trials, in which the zinc dose was &gt; 75 mg/day. The pooled effect of zinc lozenges on common cold duration was calculated by using inverse-variance random-effects method. Participants: Seven randomised trials with 575 participants with naturally acquired common colds. Main outcome measure: Duration of the common cold. Results: The mean common cold duration was 33% (95% CI 21% to 45%) shorter for the zinc groups of the seven included trials. Three trials that used lozenges composed of zinc acetate found that colds were shortened by 40% and four trials that used zinc gluconate by 28%. The difference between the two salts was not significant: 12 percentage points (95% CI: -12 to + 36). Five trials used zinc doses of 80-92 mg/day, common cold duration was reduced by 33%, and two trials used zinc doses of 192-207 mg/day and found an effect of 35%. The difference between the high-dose and low-dose zinc trials was not significant: 2 percentage points (95% CI: -29 to + 32). Conclusions: Properly composed zinc gluconate lozenges may be as effective as zinc acetate lozenges. There is no evidence that zinc doses over 100 mg/day might lead to greater efficacy in the treatment of the common cold. Common cold patients may be encouraged to try zinc lozenges for treating their colds. The optimal lozenge composition and dosage scheme need to be investigated further.",0.2679286599159241
138,2021,25888289,Can zinc help treat the common cold?,zinc common cold,1.0,"Background: A previous meta-analysis found that high dose zinc acetate lozenges reduced the duration of common colds by 42%, whereas low zinc doses had no effect. Lozenges are dissolved in the pharyngeal region, thus there might be some difference in the effect of zinc lozenges on the duration of respiratory symptoms in the pharyngeal region compared with the nasal region. The objective of this study was to determine whether zinc acetate lozenges have different effects on the duration of common cold symptoms originating from different anatomical regions. Methods: We analyzed three randomized trials on zinc acetate lozenges for the common cold administering zinc in doses of 80-92 mg/day. All three trials reported the effect of zinc on seven respiratory symptoms, and three systemic symptoms. We pooled the effects of zinc lozenges for each symptom and calculated point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: Zinc acetate lozenges shortened the duration of nasal discharge by 34% (95% CI: 17% to 51%), nasal congestion by 37% (15% to 58%), sneezing by 22% (-1% to 45%), scratchy throat by 33% (8% to 59%), sore throat by 18% (-10% to 46%), hoarseness by 43% (3% to 83%), and cough by 46% (28% to 64%). Zinc lozenges shortened the duration of muscle ache by 54% (18% to 89%), but there was no difference in the duration of headache and fever. Conclusions: The effect of zinc acetate lozenges on cold symptoms may be associated with the local availability of zinc from the lozenges, with the levels being highest in the pharyngeal region. However our findings indicate that the effects of zinc ions are not limited to the pharyngeal region. There is no indication that the effect of zinc lozenges on nasal symptoms is less than the effect on the symptoms of the pharyngeal region, which is more exposed to released zinc ions. Given that the adverse effects of zinc in the three trials were minor, zinc acetate lozenges releasing zinc ions at doses of about 80 mg/day may be a useful treatment for the common cold, started within 24 hours, for a time period of less than two weeks.",0.2889311611652374

However, the duration of colds is a time outcome, and survival analysis may be a more informative approach. The objective of this individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was to estimate the effect of zinc acetate lozenges on the rate of recovery from colds. Methods: We analyzed IPD for 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials in which 80-92 mg/day of elemental zinc were administered as zinc acetate lozenges to 199 common cold patients. We used mixed-effects Cox regression to estimate the effect of zinc. Results: Patients administered zinc lozenges recovered faster by rate ratio 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.1-4.7). The effect was not modified by age, sex, race, allergy, smoking, or baseline common cold severity. On the 5th day, 70% of the zinc patients had recovered compared with 27% of the placebo patients. Accordingly, 2.6 times more patients were cured in the zinc group. The difference also corresponds to the number needed to treat of 2.3 on the 5th day. None of the studies observed serious adverse effects of zinc. Conclusions: The 3-fold increase in the rate of recovery from the common cold is a clinically important effect.

Exclusions were pregnancy, lactation, chronic runny nose or chronic cough. Intervention: We randomised 253 participants to receive a package of lozenges to be taken if they caught the common cold. Of the 253 participants, 88 contracted the common cold and 87 were included in our primary analysis. Zinc acetate lozenges contained 13 mg elemental zinc and placebo lozenges contained sucrose octa-acetate to camouflage the taste of zinc.

138,2021,15496046,Can zinc help treat the common cold?,zinc common cold,1.0,"Objective: To review the laboratory and clinical evidence of the medicinal value of zinc for the treatment of the common cold. Data sources: Published articles identified through Medline (1980-2003) using the search terms zinc, rhinovirus, and other pertinent subject headings. Additional sources were identified from the bibliographies of the retrieved articles. Study selection: By the author. Data extraction: By the author. Data synthesis: Human rhinoviruses, by attaching to the nasal epithelium via the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) receptor, cause most colds. Ionic zinc, based on its electrical charge, also has an affinity for ICAM-1 receptor sites and may exert an antiviral effect by attaching to the ICAM-1 receptors in the rhinovirus structure and nasal epithelial cells. Clinical tests of zinc for treatment of common colds have been inconsistent, primarily because of study design, blinding, and lozenge contents. Early formulations of lozenges also were unpalatable. In three trials with similar study designs, methodologies, and efficacy assessments, zinc effectively and significantly shortened the duration of the common cold when it was administered within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Recent reports of trials with zinc gluconate administered as a nasal gel have supported these findings; in addition, they have shown that treatment with zinc nasal gel is effective in reducing the duration and severity of common cold symptoms in patients with established illness. Conclusion: Clinical trial data support the value of zinc in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms of the common cold when administered within 24 hours of the onset of common cold symptoms. Additional clinical and laboratory evaluations are warranted to further define the role of ionic zinc for the prevention and treatment of the common cold and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms through which zinc exerts its symptom-relieving effects.",0.3306959271430969

Symptom severity scores were decreased significantly in the zinc group. Mean changes in plasma levels of zinc, sIL-1ra, and ICAM-1 differed significantly between groups. Conclusion: Administration of zinc lozenges was associated with reduced duration and severity of cold symptoms. We related the improvement in cold symptoms to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of zinc.",0.2477872669696808
139,2021,961545,Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,copper bracelets reduce pain,0.0,"From over 300 arthritis sufferers, half of whom previously wore 'copper bracelets', three treatment-group-subjects were randomly allocated for a psychological study. This involved wearing 'copper bracelets' and placebo bracelets (amodised aluminum resembling copper) alternately. These groups, as also a control group, answered questionnaires. The copper bracelets were weighed before and after use. Preliminary results show that, to a significant number of subjects, the wearing of the 'copper bracelet' appeared to have some therapeutic value. A study of the components of sweat and the solubility of copper in sweat was carried out. In five sweat samples, the copper concentration was of the order 2 x 10(-5) M and after equilibrating with copper turnings at room temperature for 24 hours the samples turned blue in colour and contained approximately 2 x 10(-3) M copper. The permeability of skin to copper containing solutions has also been discussed. It has also been shown that the wearing of a 'copper bracelet' results in a weight loss in excess of the body's total burden of copper (100-150 mg). A pair of copper bracelets lost 80 mg in 50 days when worn around the ankles and a copper bracelet worn around the wrist also lost about 90 mg in that time.",0.3186626434326172

Design: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Each participant wore four devices over a 16-week period. Setting: Forty five patients with osteoarthritis were recruited from general practices in rural and urban areas of Yorkshire. Interventions: Experimental device: a commercially available magnetic wrist strap. Control devices: a weak magnetic wrist strap, a demagnetised wrist strap, and a copper bracelet. Main outcome measures: The WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index, the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Pain Rating Index (PRI), a pain visual analogue scale (VAS), and medication use. Results: No difference was observed between devices in terms of their effects on pain as measured by the primary outcome measure (WOMAC A), the PRI and the VAS. Similar results were obtained for stiffness (WOMAC B), physical function (WOMAC C), and medication use. Further analyses of the PRI subscales revealed a statistically significant difference between devices (P=0.025), which favoured the experimental device. Participants reported lower sensory pain after wearing the standard magnetic wrist strap, than when wearing control devices. However, no adjustment was made for multiple testing. Conclusions: Our results indicate that magnetic and copper bracelets are generally ineffective for managing pain, stiffness and physical function in osteoarthritis. Reported therapeutic benefits are most likely attributable to non-specific placebo effects. However such devices have no major adverse effects and may provide hope.",0.15436173975467682

139,2021,18789135,Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,copper bracelets reduce pain,0.0,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis is a common inflammatory autoimmune disease. Although disease activity may be managed effectively with prescription drugs, unproven treatments such as magnet therapy are sometimes used as an adjunct for pain control. Therapeutic devices incorporating permanent magnets are widely available and easy to use. Magnets may also be perceived as a more natural and less harmful alternative to analgesic compounds. Of interest to health service researchers is the possibility that magnet therapy might help to reduce the economic burden of managing chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Magnets are extremely cheap to manufacture and prolonged treatment involves a single cost. Despite this, good quality scientific evidence concerning the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of magnet therapy is scarce. The primary aim of the CAMBRA trial is to investigate the effectiveness of magnet therapy for relieving pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. Methods/design: The CAMBRA trial employs a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Participant will each wear four devices: a commercially available magnetic wrist strap; an attenuated wrist strap; a demagnetised wrist strap; and a copper bracelet. Device will be allocated in a randomised sequence and each worn for five weeks. The four treatment phases will be separated by wash out periods lasting one week. Both participants and researchers will be blind, as far as feasible, to the allocation of experimental and control devices. In total 69 participants will be recruited from general practices within the UK. Eligible patients will have a verified diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis that is being managed using drugs, and will be experiencing chronic pain. Outcomes measured will include pain, inflammation, disease activity, physical function, medication use, affect, and health related costs. Data will be collected using questionnaires, diaries, manual pill counts and blood tests. Discussion: Magnetism is an inherent property of experimental devices which is hard to conceal. The use of multiple control devices, including a copper bracelet, represents a concerted attempt to overcome methodological limitations associated with trials in this field. The trial began in July 2007. At the time of submission (August 2008) recruitment has finished, with 70 trial participants, and data collection is almost complete.

Epidemiologic evidence indicates that depressed heart rate variability is associated with reduced survival from coronary heart disease as well as increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. The authors examined mortality from cardiovascular disease in relation to occupational magnetic field exposure among a cohort of 138,903 male electric utility workers from five US companies over the period 1950-1988. Cardiovascular disease deaths were categorized as arrhythmia related (n = 212), acute myocardial infarction (n = 4,238), atherosclerosis (n = 142), or chronic coronary heart disease (n = 2,210). Exposure was classified by duration of work in jobs with elevated magnetic field exposure and indices of cumulative magnetic field exposure. Adjusting for age, year, race, social class, and active work status, longer duration in jobs with elevated magnetic field exposure was associated with increased risk of death from arrhythmia-related conditions and acute myocardial infarction. Indices of magnetic field exposure were consistently related to mortality from arrhythmia and acute myocardial infarction, with mortality rate ratios of 1.5-3.3 in the uppermost categories. No gradients in risk were found for atherosclerosis or for chronic coronary heart disease. These data suggest a possible association between occupational magnetic fields and arrhythmia-related heart disease.",0.07345172762870789
139,2021,7928105,Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,copper bracelets reduce pain,0.0,"Recently, I reported that extracranial treatment with picoTesla range magnetic fields (MF) is an effective, safe, and revolutionary modality in the management of Parkinsonism including those patients manifesting levodopa-induced motor complications. This treatment, which has emerged as a potentially more advantageous modality than pharmacologic therapy, also produces improvements in nonmotor aspects of the disease including mood, cognitive functions, sleep, pain, appetite, autonomic functions, and sexual behavior, which are usually minimally, if at all, ameliorated by long term therapy with levodopa or anticholinergic agents. The present communication concerns a 69 year old Parkinsonian patient who, following a series of two treatments with extracranial picoTesla range MF on two separate days, improved to the point where he was able to discontinue most of his antiparkinsonian medications for a period of two weeks without experiencing deterioration in symptoms. On the third week he began to develop recurrence of symptoms and resumed taking his regular medications. At the end of the fourth week the patient received a series of four magnetic treatments on four successive days after he completely discontinued his antiparkinsonian medications. During this period he experienced a remarkable improvement in motor disability as well as in cognitive functions (i.e., visuospatial performance), mood, sleep, appetite, bowel functions and resolution of pain in the lower extremity. This report attests to the antiparkinsonian efficacy of picoTesla range MF and suggests that this treatment, when applied on a regular basis, may reduce the requirement for antiparkinsonian medications. This observation, when confirmed in a larger cohort of patients, may carry important implications for the therapy of Parkinsonism as it may offer an alternative treatment for patients who develop levodopa failure or experience intolerable side effects from dopaminergic medication. The observation that magnetic treatment improved the patient's symptoms while being off dopaminergic therapy supports the role of nondopaminergic mechanisms in the pathophysiology of Parkinsonism.",0.18034367263317108

However, no one has reported therapeutic efficacy of pain relief from pudendal neuralgia with sacral magnetic stimulation. Methods: Five patients with pudendal neuralgia or sciatica received 30 to 50 pulsed magnetic stimuli of the sacral nerve roots. The median age of the patients was 59 (range, 28-69) years; there were 3 females. Results: Sacral magnetic stimulation immediately eliminated the pain. The pain relief lasted between 30 minutes and 56 days (median, 24 hours). Adverse effects were not observed. Conclusions: This pilot study indicates that magnetic stimulation of the sacral nerve roots may be a promising therapeutic modality for pain relief from pudendal neuralgia and sciatica.

We used the avridine arthritis rat model to evaluate the tissue response in the synovial, interstitial and subcutaneous tissues after implant insertion. Quantitative immunohistochemistry showed that normal joint synovial tissue is dominated by ED2-positive resident macrophages. Polyethylene implants induced a much stronger foreign-body reaction than titanium implants, as measured by the number of interfacial ED1-positive macrophages. The tissue response to titanium and polyethylene was also vastly different in arthritic synovial tissue compared with control tissue. It is likely that these biomaterials interact differently with inflammatory cells or intermediary compounds. It may be that arthritic synovial tissue produces reactive oxygen intermediates (free radicals) with which titanium has a unique anti-inflammatory interaction in vitro.",0.22571924328804016

There are several accepted treatments, but these can be uncomfortable, inconvenient, and expensive. A number of alternative treatments have been reported to be beneficial in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and snoring. They are advertised in magazines, on the radio and television, and on the Internet. The lay press is reporting about the effectiveness of these treatments without the benefit of clinical trials or scientific studies. Among the therapies currently being promoted for the treatment of snoring and sleep apnea is biomagnetic therapy. Unlike many of the other treatments which have not undergone scientific evaluation, biomagnetic therapy has been evaluated in the past. In fact, the evaluation of biomagnetic therapy is one of the first controlled scientific investigations found in the literature. This report showed that magnet therapy had no medicinal value. Despite this clear evidence, magnetic therapy continues to be utilized today and currently is being promoted for the treatment of snoring and sleep apnea. At out Sleep Disorder Center, we have had the opportunity to evaluate a patient with severe obstructive sleep apnea both before and after treatment with magnetic therapy, as well as with conventional therapy. Our study clearly indicates there was no benefit from magnetic therapy in this case.

However, despite the ongoing treatment, the consequences of this disease are possible, which may appear in the short term or after a while. Pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 is characterized by the presence of such complications as cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, sleep disturbances, appetite disorders, etc. Often, pneumonia leads to dysfunctions of the respiratory system, higher mental functions, functions of the cardiovascular system and, unfortunately, possible disability. The search and implementation of new methods of physical rehabilitation is an urgent task of modern medicine. Low-frequency magnetotherapy is one of the safest and most commonly recommended treatments for pneumonia. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of the use of low-frequency magnetotherapy in the complex medical rehabilitation of patients who have had pneumonia in the phase of convalescence. Material and methods: The study included 52 patients who had suffered from pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and whose average age was 56.2±5.7 years. Group I (main) group ( n =30), against the background of standard therapy on the 16th day after discharge from the hospital, received low-frequency magnetotherapy on the ALMAG-02 apparatus (Elamed, Russia) daily for 20 minutes, a course of 10-12 procedures. In the second (control) group ( n =22), therapy was carried out in accordance with the Temporary Clinical Recommendations of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection COVID-19 (version 8.1 of 01/10/2020), as well as the Temporary Clinical recommendations for medical rehabilitation for a new coronavirus infection (version 8.1 of 01/10/2020). Evaluation method: spirometry using a spirographMIR (Italy), chest excursion, rehabilitation routing scale (RRM), quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D), Borg scale for patient assessment of exercise tolerance, ECG, oxygen saturation in the blood. Results and discussion: The patients of the 1st group showed an increase in the vital capacity of the lungs by 16.4% in comparison with the 2nd (control) group; an increase in chest excursion by 45.6%, a decrease in the level of shortness of breath from moderate to mild by 64.1%, a decrease in disabilities by 62.7%, compared with the second (control) group.

Furthermore, most patients with moccasin tinea pedis also have onychomycosis, thus adding to the recalcitrant nature of the infection. The topical antifungals used as sole therapy are generally ineffective because the scale on the plantar surface impedes or limits the absorption of the antifungal agent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 40% urea cream as an adjunct to topical antifungals in the treatment of moccasin tinea pedis. Patients with untreated moccasin tinea pedis were selected from the general dermatology clinic. The diagnosis of moccasin tinea pedis was made clinically and confirmed with a potassium hydroxide test or a positive fungal culture. A total of 12 patients with moccasin tinea pedis were treated with 40% urea cream once daily and ciclopirox cream twice daily. Patients then were evaluated after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment for the presence of erythema, scaling, and pruritus.

140,2021,14960127,Can fungal creams treat athlete's foot?,fungal cream athlete's foot,1.0,"Superficial fungal infections of the foot (tinea pedis and onychomycosis) are common among elderly patients. Although most authorities believe that patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased predisposition to dermatophytic infections, some controversies still remain. Because these infections disrupt the skin integrity and provide an avenue for bacterial superinfection, elderly diabetic patients with dermatophytic infection should be promptly treated with an antifungal agent. For most dermatophytic infections of the foot, topical agents are usually effective and less expensive than oral agents. Laboratory diagnosis of fungal infection prior to institution of therapy is recommended. Proper technique for obtaining the specimen is important to ensure a higher chance of isolating the infecting fungus. Commonly used anti-dermatophytic agents that are also active against the yeasts include the imidazoles, the allylamines-benzylamines and the hydroxypyridones, which are also effective against most of the moulds. Oral therapy for tinea pedis, although not well studied, should be limited to patients with more extensive infections, such as vesicobullous and moccasin type, resistant infections or chronic infections. In addition, oral agents should also be considered in diabetic and immunosuppressed patients. On the other hand, treatment of onychomycosis of the foot usually requires systemic therapy. Griseofulvin is the least effective agent when compared with the newer agents. Terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole have been shown to have acceptable cure rates. More recently, topical treatment of the nail with 8% ciclopirox nail lacquer, bifonazole with urea and amorolfine have been reported to be successful. Over the past decade, fungal foot infections of the skin and nail are more effectively treated with the introduction of numerous topical and oral agents.",0.14620499312877655

The dermatophytes are commonly keratinophilic in nature which can multiply and invade the keratinized tissues and affect various parts of the human body like nails, skin, and hair. The luliconazole is an antifungal drug utilized against dermatophytes which causes athlete's foot and ringworm etc. fungal infections of the skin or nails caused by Candida albicans (C.P. Robin) Berkhout and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (Robin) Blanchard. Objective: The study aimed to develop the luliconazole topical cream with turmeric oil and penetration enhancer to improve permeability and enhance antifungal activity. Methods: To prepare the luliconazole topical cream, various compositions of formulation were melted and mixed with varying concentrations of turmeric oil. The oil, drug, and aqueous phases were prepared separately and mixed stepwise in a vessel under continuous stirring at control conditions. Results: The optimized LC2 cream showed pH 6.45±0.12, which is considered suitable to avoid irritation upon topical application. The LC2 cream formulation also showed significantly (p 0.05) more permeability with a permeation flux (0.347 mg/cm2/h) against an aqueous suspension of the drug (0.215 mg/cm2/h). The LC2 cream followed the Higuchi model and showed the drug release from cream via a diffusion mechanism with super case II transport mechanism. Furthermore, the antifungal activity of optimized cream was found better than marketed cream. Conclusion: It is concluded that the prepared luliconazole cream can be an effective anti-fungal treatment with enhanced drug delivery into the skin to treat athlete's foot and ringworm etc. caused by dermatophytes namely C. albicans and Trichophyton spp.",0.8256637454032898

Ciclopirox, a broad-spectrum hydroxypyridone antifungal, has proven efficacy against the organisms commonly implicated in tinea pedis; Trichophyton rubrum, T.mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum. Objective: Two multicenter, double-blind, clinical studies compared the efficacy and safety of ciclopirox gel with that of its vehicle base in subjects with moderate interdigital tinea pedis with or without plantar involvement. Methods: Three hundred and seventy-four subjects were enrolled and randomized to one of two treatment groups: ciclopirox gel 0.77%, or ciclopirox gel vehicle, applied twice daily for 28 days, with a final visit up to day 50. The primary efficacy variable was Treatment Success defined as combined mycological cure and clinical improvement &gt;/= 75%. Secondary measures of effectiveness were Global Clinical Response, Sign and Symptom Severity Scores, Mycological Evaluation (KOH examination and final culture result), Mycological Cure (negative KOH and negative final culture results) and Treatment Cure (combined clinical and mycological cure). Results: At endpoint (final post-baseline visit), 60% of the ciclopirox subjects achieved treatment success compared to 6% of the vehicle subjects. At the same time point, 66% of ciclopirox subjects compared with 19% of vehicle subjects were either cleared or had excellent improvement. Pooled data showed that 85% of ciclopirox subjects were mycologically cured, compared to only 16% of vehicle subjects at day 43, 2 weeks post-treatment.

The aims of this study were to investigate the antifungal activity of SB on the three fungal groups (yeasts, dermatophytes and molds) responsible for human skin and nail infections. We first evaluated the in vitro antifungal activity of SB on 70 fungal strains isolated from skin and nail infections: 40 dermatophytes, 18 yeasts and 12 molds. A concentration of 10 g/L SB inhibited the growth of 80% of all the fungal isolates tested on Sabouraud dextrose agar. The minimal inhibitory concentration 90 (MIC90) of SB measured on Sabouraud dextrose agar, Sabouraud dextrose broth and potato dextrose broth was 5 g/L for the yeasts, 20 g/L for the dermatophytes and 40 g/L for the molds. In a second step, we prospectively evaluated the ex vivo antifungal activity of SB on 24 infected (15 dermatophytes, 7 yeasts and 2 molds) clinical specimens (15 nails and 9 skin scrapings). The fungal growth was completely inhibited for 19 (79%) specimens and reduced for 4 (17%) specimens after 7 days of incubation on Sabouraud dextrose-chloramphenicol agar supplemented with 10 g/L of SB as compared to Sabouraud dextrose-chloramphenicol agar without SB.

140,2021,24714996,Can fungal creams treat athlete's foot?,fungal cream athlete's foot,1.0,"Background: About 15% of the world population have fungal infections of the feet (tinea pedis or athlete's foot). There are many clinical presentations of tinea pedis, and most commonly, tinea pedis is seen between the toes (interdigital) and on the soles, heels, and sides of the foot (plantar). Plantar tinea pedis is known as moccasin foot. Once acquired, the infection can spread to other sites including the nails, which can be a source of re-infection. Oral therapy is usually used for chronic conditions or when topical treatment has failed. Objective: To assess the effects of oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot (tinea pedis). Search methods: For this update we searched the following databases to July 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and CINAHL (from 1981). We checked the bibliographies of retrieved trials for further references to relevant trials, and we searched online trials registers. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials of oral treatments in participants who have a clinically diagnosed tinea pedis, confirmed by microscopy and growth of dermatophytes (fungi) in culture. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently undertook study selection, ""Risk of bias"" assessment, and data extraction. Main results: We included 15 trials, involving 1,438 participants. The 2 trials (71 participants) comparing terbinafine and griseofulvin produced a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 2.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 3.44) in favors of terbinafine's ability to cure infection. No significant difference was detected between terbinafine and itraconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole, fluconazole and ketoconazole, or between griseofulvin and ketoconazole, although the trials were generally small. Two trials showed that terbinafine and itraconazole were effective compared with placebo: terbinafine (31 participants, RR 24.54, 95%CI 1.57 to 384.32) and itraconazole (72 participants, RR 6.67, 95%CI 2.17 to 20.48). All drugs reported adverse effects, with gastrointestinal effects most commonly reported. Ten of the trials were published over 15 years ago, and this is reflected by the poor reporting of information from which to make a clear ""Risk of bias"" assessment. Only one trial was at low risk of bias overall. The majority of the remaining trials were judged as ""unclear"" risk of bias because of the lack of clear statements with respect to methods of generating the randomization sequence and allocation concealment. More trials achieved blinding of participants and personnel than blinding of the outcome assessors, which was again poorly reported. Authors' conclusions: The evidence suggests that terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin; and terbinafine and itraconazole are more effective than no treatment. In order to produce more reliable data , a rigorous evaluation of different drug therapies needs to be undertaken with larger sample sizes to ensure they are large enough to show any real difference when two treatments are being compared. It is also important to continue to follow up and collect data , preferably for six months after the end of the intervention period, to establish whether or not the infection recurred.",0.1272299587726593

Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of three different doses of fluconazole (150, 300, and 450 mg) given orally once weekly to that of placebo in the treatment of distal subungual onychomycosis of the toenail caused by dermatophytes. Methods: In this multicenter, double-blind study, 362 patients with mycologically confirmed onychomycosis were randomized to treatment with fluconazole, 150, 300, or 450 mg once weekly, or placebo once weekly for a maximum of 12 months. To enter the study, patients were required to have at least 25% involvement of the target nail with at least 2 mm of healthy nail from the nail fold to the proximal onychomycotic border. Patients who were clinically cured or improved at the end of treatment were further evaluated over a 6 month follow-up period. At both the end of therapy and the end of follow-up, clinical success of the target nail was defined as reduction of the affected area to less than 25% or cure. Results: At the end of therapy, 86% to 89% of patients in the fluconazole treatment groups were judged clinical successes as defined above compared with 8% of placebo-treated patients. Clinical cure (completely healthy nail) was achieved in 28% to 36% of fluconazole-treated patients compared with 3% of placebo-treated patients. Fluconazole demonstrated mycologic eradication rates of 47% to 62% at the end of therapy compared with 14% for placebo. The rates at the end of follow-up were very similar, indicating that eradication of the dermatophyte was maintained over the 6-month period. All efficacy measures for the fluconazole groups were significantly superior to placebo (p=0.0001); there were no significant differences between the fluconazole groups on these efficacy measures. The clinical relapse rate among cured patients over 6 months of follow-up was low at 4%. Fluconazole was well tolerated at all doses over the 12-month treatment period, with the incidence and severity of adverse events being similar between the fluconazole and placebo treatment groups. Mean time to clinical success in the fluconazole treatment groups was 6 to 7 months. This time frame may be used as a guideline for fluconazole treatment duration. Conclusion: The results of this study support the use of fluconazole in the treatment of distal subungual onychomycosis of the toenail caused by dermatophytes. Doses between 150 to 450 mg weekly for 6 months were clinically and mycologically effective as well as safe and well tolerated.",0.126382514834404

While not medically dangerous, SG can be disfiguring, causing emotional and psychological distress. However, studies specifically addressing the prevention of SG, especially during pregnancy, are sparse. Furthermore, the molecular pathogenesis of SG is unclear and may differ from that of striae from other causes. Considering these factors, we review topical modalities that have been used specifically for preventing SG during pregnancy. We identify two major strategies (end points) addressed by these modalities, namely (i) preventing the de novo development of SG and (ii) reducing the severity of SG that have recently developed. We also identify risk factors for the development of SG and suggest that pregnant women with these risk factors are an appropriate target population for prevention. In reviewing the literature, we find that there is limited evidence that centella, and possibly massage with bitter almond oil, may prevent SG and/or reduce their severity. There is weak evidence that hyaluronic acid prevents SG. Tretinoin holds promise for reducing the severity of new-onset SG, but its use is limited by its pregnancy category. Finally, cocoa butter and olive oil are not effective for preventing SG or reducing the severity of lesions. We conclude that reliable methods for preventing SG are scarce. Furthermore, available topical modalities generally lack strong evidence from rigorous, well-designed, randomized controlled trials with ample numbers of subjects. Thus, further research is necessary to elucidate SG pathogenesis, which may lead to effective prevention modalities.",0.13606637716293335

Given the broad spectrum of diarrhea, this review focuses on the main etiologies: acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). For each, we reviewed randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and guidelines. For acute gastroenteritis we found 12 guidelines: 5 recommended probiotics and 7 did not. However, the guidelines containing positive recommendations provided proof of evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Saccharomyces boulardii had the most compelling evidence of efficacy as they reduced the duration of the disease by 1 day. For AAD 4 meta-analyses were found, reporting variable efficacy of probiotics in preventing diarrhea, based on the setting, patient's age, and antibiotics. The most effective strains were LGG and S. boulardii. For NEC, we found 3 randomized controlled trials, 5 meta-analyses, and 4 position papers. Probiotics reduced the risk of NEC enterocolitis and mortality in preterm babies. Guidelines did not support a routine use of probiotics and asked for further data for such sensitive implications. In conclusion, there is strong and solid proof of efficacy of probiotics as active treatment of gastroenteritis in addition to rehydration. There is solid evidence that probiotics have some efficacy in prevention of AAD, but the number needed to treat is an issue. For both etiologies LGG and S. boulardii have the strongest evidence. In NEC the indications are more debated, yet on the basis of available data and their implications, probiotics should be carefully considered.",0.14157290756702423

Objective: To assess the effect of a multispecies probiotic on the risk of AAD in children. Design, setting, and participants: This randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted from February 2018 to May 2021 in a multicenter, mixed setting (inpatients and outpatients). Patients were followed up throughout the intervention period. Eligibility criteria included age 3 months to 18 years, recruitment within 24 hours following initiation of broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics, and signed informed consent. In total, 646 eligible patients were approached and 350 patients took part in the trial. Interventions: A multispecies probiotic consisting of Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W51, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, L acidophilus W55, Lactocaseibacillus paracasei W20, Lactoplantibacillus plantarum W62, Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus W71, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius W24, for a total dose of 10 billion colony-forming units daily, for the duration of antibiotic treatment and for 7 days after. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was AAD, defined as 3 or more loose or watery stools per day in a 24-hour period, caused either by Clostridioides difficile or of otherwise unexplained etiology, after testing for common diarrheal pathogens. The secondary outcomes included diarrhea regardless of the etiology, diarrhea duration, and predefined diarrhea complications. Results: A total of 350 children (192 boys and 158 girls; mean [range] age, 50 [3-212] months) were randomized and 313 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Compared with placebo (n = 155), the probiotic (n = 158) had no effect on risk of AAD (relative risk [RR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.49-1.33). However, children in the probiotic group had a lower risk of diarrhea regardless of the etiology (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.94). No differences were observed between the groups for most of the secondary outcomes, including adverse events. Conclusions and relevance: A multispecies probiotic did not reduce the risk of AAD in children when analyzed according to the most stringent definition. However, it reduced the overall risk of diarrhea during and for 7 days after antibiotic treatment. Our study also shows that the AAD definition has a significant effect on clinical trial results and their interpretation.

142,2021,31039287,Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,probiotics child diarrhea caused by antibiotics ,1.0,"Background: Antibiotics alter the microbial balance commonly resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics may prevent AAD via providing gut barrier, restoration of the gut microflora, and other potential mechanisms of action. Objectives: The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children. Search methods: MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and the Web of Science (inception to 28 May 2018) were searched along with registers including the ISRCTN and Clinicaltrials.gov. We also searched the NICE Evidence Services database as well as reference lists from relevant articles. Selection criteria: Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of AAD, adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea) as mean difference (MD), along with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. For studies reporting on microbiome characteristics using heterogeneous outcomes, we describe the results narratively. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. Main results: Thirty-three studies (6352 participants) were included. Probiotics assessed included Bacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., orStreptococcus spp., alone or in combination. The risk of bias was determined to be high in 20 studies and low in 13 studies. Complete case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 33 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control.After 5 days to 12 weeks of follow-up, the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (259/3232) compared to 19% (598/3120) in the control group (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.56; I² = 57%, 6352 participants; NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13; moderate certainty evidence). Nineteen studies had loss to follow-up ranging from 1% to 46%. After making assumptions for those lost, the observed benefit was still statistically significant using an extreme plausible intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, wherein the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 12% (436/3551) compared to 19% (664/3468) in the control group (7019 participants; RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.77; P 0.00001; I² = 70%). An a priori available case subgroup analysis exploring heterogeneity indicated that high dose (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) is more effective than low probiotic dose ( 5 billion CFUs per day), interaction P value = 0.01. For the high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (162/2029) compared to 23% (462/2009) in the control group (4038 participants; RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.46; P = 0.06; moderate certainty evidence). For the low dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (97/1155) compared to 13% (133/1059) in the control group (2214 participants; RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.01; P = 0.02). Again, assumptions for loss to follow-up using an extreme plausible ITT analysis was statistically significant. For high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 13% (278/2218) compared to 23% (503/2207) in control group (4425 participants; RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.70; P 0.00001; I² = 68%; moderate certainty evidence).None of the 24 trials (4415 participants) that reported on adverse events reported any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Adverse event rates were low. After 5 days to 4 weeks follow-up, 4% (86/2229) of probiotics participants had an adverse event compared to 6% (121/2186) of control participants (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; P 0.00001; I² = 75%; low certainty evidence). Common adverse events included rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, and constipation.After 10 days to 12 weeks of follow-up, eight studies recorded data on our secondary outcome, the mean duration of diarrhea; with probiotics reducing diarrhea duration by almost one day (MD -0.91; 95% CI -1.38 to -0.44; P 0.00001; low certainty evidence). One study reported on microbiome characteristics, reporting no difference in changes with concurrent antibiotic and probiotic use. Authors' conclusions: The overall evidence suggests a moderate protective effect of probiotics for preventing AAD (NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13). Using five criteria to evaluate the credibility of the subgroup analysis on probiotic dose, the results indicate the subgroup effect based on high dose probiotics (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) was credible. Based on high-dose probiotics, the NNTB to prevent one case of diarrhea is 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). The overall certainty of the evidence for the primary endpoint, incidence of AAD based on high dose probiotics was moderate due to the minor issues with risk of bias and inconsistency related to a diversity of probiotic agents used. Evidence also suggests that probiotics may moderately reduce the duration of diarrhea, a reduction by almost one day. The benefit of high dose probiotics (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus orSaccharomyces boulardii) needs to be confirmed by a large well-designed multi-centered randomized trial. It is premature to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy and safety of 'other' probiotic agents as an adjunct to antibiotics in children. Adverse event rates were low and no serious adverse events were attributable to probiotics. Although no serious adverse events were observed among inpatient and outpatient children, including small studies conducted in the intensive care unit and in the neonatal unit, observational studies not included in this review have reported serious adverse events in severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation.",0.29977065324783325
142,2021,29257353,Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,probiotics child diarrhea caused by antibiotics ,1.0,"Background: Antibiotics can disturb gastrointestinal microbiota which may lead to reduced resistance to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). Probiotics are live microbial preparations that, when administered in adequate amounts, may confer a health benefit to the host, and are a potential C. difficile prevention strategy. Recent clinical practice guidelines do not recommend probiotic prophylaxis, even though probiotics have the highest quality evidence among cited prophylactic therapies. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for preventing C.difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in adults and children. Search methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 21 March 2017. Additionally, we conducted an extensive grey literature search. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled (placebo, alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment control) trials investigating probiotics (any strain, any dose) for prevention of CDAD, or C. difficile infection were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Two authors (independently and in duplicate) extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcome was the incidence of CDAD. Secondary outcomes included detection of C. difficile infection in stool, adverse events, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and length of hospital stay. Dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence of CDAD) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. Continuous outcomes (e.g. length of hospital stay) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of missing data on efficacy and safety outcomes. For the sensitivity analyses, we assumed that the event rate for those participants in the control group who had missing data was the same as the event rate for those participants in the control group who were successfully followed. For the probiotic group, we calculated effects using the following assumed ratios of event rates in those with missing data in comparison to those successfully followed: 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analyses were conducted on probiotic species, dose, adult versus pediatric population, and risk of bias as well as a post hoc subgroup analysis on baseline risk of CDAD (low 0% to 2%; moderate 3% to 5%; high &gt; 5%). The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was independently assessed using the GRADE criteria. Main results: Thirty-nine studies (9955 participants) met the eligibility requirements for our review. Overall, 27 studies were rated as either high or unclear risk of bias. A complete case analysis (i.e. participants who completed the study) among trials investigating CDAD (31 trials, 8672 participants) suggests that probiotics reduce the risk of CDAD by 60%. The incidence of CDAD was 1.5% (70/4525) in the probiotic group compared to 4.0% (164/4147) in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.52; GRADE = moderate). Twenty-two of 31 trials had missing CDAD data ranging from 2% to 45%. Our complete case CDAD results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of plausible and worst-plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data and results were similar whether considering subgroups of trials in adults versus children, inpatients versus outpatients, different probiotic species, lower versus higher doses of probiotics, or studies at high versus low risk of bias. However, in a post hoc analysis, we did observe a subgroup effect with respect to baseline risk of developing CDAD. Trials with a baseline CDAD risk of 0% to 2% and 3% to 5% did not show any difference in risk but trials enrolling participants with a baseline risk of &gt; 5% for developing CDAD demonstrated a large 70% risk reduction (interaction P value = 0.01). Among studies with a baseline risk &gt; 5%, the incidence of CDAD in the probiotic group was 3.1% (43/1370) compared to 11.6% (126/1084) in the control group (13 trials, 2454 participants; RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.42; GRADE = moderate). With respect to detection of C. difficile in the stool pooled complete case results from 15 trials (1214 participants) did not show a reduction in infection rates. C. difficile infection was 15.5% (98/633) in the probiotics group compared to 17.0% (99/581) in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.10; GRADE = moderate). Adverse events were assessed in 32 studies (8305 participants) and our pooled complete case analysis indicates probiotics reduce the risk of adverse events by 17% (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97; GRADE = very low). In both treatment and control groups the most common adverse events included abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance. Authors' conclusions: Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 randomized controlled trials including 8672 patients, moderate certainty evidence suggests that probiotics are effective for preventing CDAD (NNTB = 42 patients, 95% CI 32 to 58). Our post hoc subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity indicated that probiotics are effective among trials with a CDAD baseline risk &gt;5% (NNTB = 12; moderate certainty evidence), but not among trials with a baseline risk ≤5% (low to moderate certainty evidence). Although adverse effects were reported among 32 included trials, there were more adverse events among patients in the control groups. The short-term use of probiotics appears to be safe and effective when used along with antibiotics in patients who are not immunocompromised or severely debilitated. Despite the need for further research, hospitalized patients, particularly those at high risk of CDAD, should be informed of the potential benefits and harms of probiotics.",0.17196376621723175

Evidence acquisition: We did a PubMed, Medline and Cochrane libary search for literature available in last 25 years. Results: Prevalence of antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) is around 11% Children younger than 2 years and type of antibiotics are the two risk factors identified for AAD. For the pediatric population, CDI reportedly decreased in a tertiary care hospital in India, though number of suspected samples tested increased. The incidence of community acquired CDI is increasing in the pediatric population also. Detection of toxin A and B by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and detection of toxin B by tissue culture form the mainstay in the diagnosis of C. difficile. Most of the AAD would respond to only discontinuation or change of the antibiotic. Oral metronidazole or oral vancomycin are drugs of choice for CDI. Probiotics reduce the risk of AAD in children and for every 7-10 patients one less would develop AAD. Conclusion: Prevalence of AAD is low and majority will respond to discontinuation of antibiotic.

143,2021,12804508,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol or Tylenol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line pharmacologic therapy. The comparative safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs is important to consider as NSAIDs have the potential for serious gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular toxicities, and acetaminophen in high dosages (greater than or equal to 2 grams per day), may also have the potential for serious upper gastrointestinal toxicity. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus NSAIDs (ibuprofen, arthrotec, celecoxib,naproxen, rofecoxib) for treating OA. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (up to July 2002), and Current Contents (up to March 2002). Reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles were also hand searched. Selection criteria: Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen alone in OA were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Pain, physical function and global assessment outcomes were reported. Results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as standardized mean differences. Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk and the number needed to treat was calculated. Main results: Six RCTs and 1689 participants were included in the review. One study compared acetaminophen to placebo, and five compared acetaminophen to NSAIDs. In the placebo-controlled RCT, acetaminophen was shown to be clearly superior to placebo with a similar safety profile. The number needed to treat to achieve an improvement in pain was three. In the comparator-controlled RCTs, acetaminophen was less effective overall than NSAIDs in terms of pain reduction and global assessments but both drugs had similar efficacy in terms of improvements in functional status. No significant difference was found between the safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs, although patients taking NSAIDS were more likely to withdraw due to GI events. Reviewer's conclusions: The evidence to date suggests that NSAIDs are superior to acetaminophen for improving knee and hip pain in people with OA but have not been shown to be superior in improving function. The size of the treatment effect was modest, and the mean trial duration was only six weeks, therefore, additional considerations need to be factored in when making the decision between using acetaminophen or NSAIDs. In OA subjects with moderate-to-severe levels of pain, NSAIDs appear to be more effective than acetaminophen.",0.1644195169210434

Published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol or Tylenol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line pharmacologic therapy. The comparative safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs is also important to consider. This update to the original 2003 review includes nine additional RCTs. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, arthrotec, celecoxib, naproxen, rofecoxib) for treating OA. Search strategy: We searched MEDLINE (up to July 2005), EMBASE (2002-July 2005), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ACP Journal Club, DARE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (all from 1994 to July 2005). Reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles were also hand searched. Selection criteria: Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen alone in OA were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Pain, physical function and global assessment outcomes were reported. Results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as standardized mean differences (SMD). Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk (RR) and the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated. Main results: Fifteen RCTs involving 5986 participants were included in this review. Seven RCTs compared acetaminophen to placebo and ten RCTs compared acetaminophen to NSAIDs. In the placebo-controlled RCTs, acetaminophen was superior to placebo in five of the seven RCTs and had a similar safety profile. Compared to placebo, a pooled analysis of five trials of overall pain using multiple methods demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.04), which is of questionable clinical significance. The relative percent improvement from baseline was 5% with an absolute change of 4 points on a 0 to 100 scale. The NNT to achieve an improvement in pain ranged from 4 to 16. In the comparator-controlled RCTs, acetaminophen was less effective overall than NSAIDs in terms of pain reduction, global assessments and in terms of improvements in functional status. No significant difference was found overall between the safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs, although patients taking traditional NSAIDS were more likely to experience an adverse GI event (RR 1.47, (95% CI 1.08 to 2.00). 19% of patients in the traditional NSAID group versus 13% in the acetaminophen group experienced an adverse GI event. However, the median trial duration was only 6 weeks and it is difficult to assess adverse outcomes in a relatively short time period. Authors' conclusions: The evidence to date suggests that NSAIDs are superior to acetaminophen for improving knee and hip pain in people with OA. The size of the treatment effect was modest, and the median trial duration was only six weeks, therefore, additional considerations need to be factored in when making the decision between using acetaminophen or NSAIDs.

143,2021,34252357,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common difficult-to-treat condition where the goal, in the absence of disease-modifying treatments, is to alleviate symptoms such as pain and loss of function. Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opioids are common pharmacologic treatments for OA. Antibodies directed against nerve growth factor (NGF-Abs) are a new class of agents under clinical investigation for the treatment of OA. This narrative review describes (and uses schematics to visualize) nociceptive signaling, chronification of pain, and the mechanisms of action (MOAs) of these different analgesics in the context of OA-related pain pathophysiology. Further, the varying levels of efficacy and safety of these agents observed in patients with OA is examined, based on an overview of published clinical data and/or treatment guidelines (when available), in the context of differences in their MOAs.",0.3960297107696533
143,2021,17265490,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Objective: To assess the effects of the prescription formulation of glucosamine sulfate (1,500 mg administered once daily) on the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis (OA) during a 6-month treatment course. Methods: Three hundred eighteen patients were enrolled in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in which acetaminophen, the currently preferred medication for symptomatic treatment of OA, was used as a side comparator. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral glucosamine sulfate 1,500 mg once daily (n = 106), acetaminophen 3 gm/day (n = 108), or placebo (n = 104). The primary efficacy outcome measure was the change in the Lequesne index after 6 months. Secondary parameters included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and response according to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International criteria. These outcome measures were assessed using an intent-to-treat analysis. Results: At baseline, the study patients had moderately severe OA symptoms (mean Lequesne index approximately 11 points). Glucosamine sulfate was more effective than placebo in improving the Lequesne score, with a final decrease of 3.1 points, versus 1.9 with placebo (difference between glucosamine sulfate and placebo -1.2 [95% confidence interval -2.3, -0.8]) (P = 0.032). The 2.7-point decrease with acetaminophen was not significantly different from that with placebo (difference -0.8 [95% confidence interval -1.9, 0.3]) (P = 0.18). Similar results were observed for the WOMAC. There were more responders to glucosamine sulfate (39.6%) and acetaminophen (33.3%) than to placebo (21.2%) (P = 0.004 and P = 0.047, respectively, versus placebo). Safety was good, and was comparable among groups. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that glucosamine sulfate at the oral once-daily dosage of 1,500 mg is more effective than placebo in treating knee OA symptoms. Although acetaminophen also had a higher responder rate compared with placebo, it failed to show significant effects on the algofunctional indexes.",0.16501517593860626
143,2021,11754710,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Context: Osteoarthritis (OA) is often treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). Objective: To assess the relative therapeutic efficacy of rofecoxib, celecoxib, and acetaminophen in adults with OA. Design and setting: Randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trial, conducted from June 1999 to February 2000, in 29 clinical centers in the United States. Patients: Three hundred eighty-two patients aged at least 40 years who had OA of the knee that was previously treated with NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d (n = 96); rofecoxib, 25 mg/d (n = 95); celecoxib, 200 mg/d (n = 97); or acetaminophen, 4000 mg/d (n = 94) for 6 weeks. Main outcome measures: Assessments over days 1 to 6 and over 6 weeks included pain on walking, night pain, pain at rest, and morning stiffness as measured on a Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (100-mm visual analog scale [VAS]) and global response to therapy compared among 4 treatment groups. Results: 79% of patients completed the study. More patients treated with acetaminophen discontinued early due to lack of efficacy than patients treated with COX-2 inhibitors (31% vs 18%-19%). Efficacy assessed in the first 6 days of therapy showed greatest response to rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, followed by rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d, celecoxib, and acetaminophen, respectively, in terms of relief of pain on walking (-32.2, - 29.0, - 26.4, and -20.6 mm change on the VAS; P /=.04 for all others vs acetaminophen; P =.05 for 25-mg rofecoxib vs celecoxib), rest pain (-21.8, - 18.6, - 15.5, and - 12.5 mm; P /=.02 for either dose of rofecoxib vs acetaminophen and P =.02 for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs celecoxib), night pain (-25.2, - 22.0, - 18.7, and - 18.8 mm; P =.04 for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs both acetaminophen and celecoxib), and morning stiffness (-30.4, - 28.4, - 25.7, and - 20.9 mm; P /=.02 for either dose of rofecoxib vs acetaminophen). Over 6 weeks, rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, provided greatest response for night pain (P .002 vs celecoxib and P =.006 vs acetaminophen and P =.02 vs rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d), composite pain subscale (P /=.03 vs all other treatments), stiffness subscale (P /=.04 vs celecoxib and acetaminophen), and physical function subscale (P =.001 vs acetaminophen). Global responses over 6 weeks showed a similar pattern (good or excellent response at week 6: 60%, 56%, 46%, and 39%, respectively; P /=.03 for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs celecoxib and acetaminophen; P =.02 for rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d, vs acetaminophen). All treatments were generally safe and well tolerated. Conclusion: Rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, provided efficacy advantages over acetaminophen, 4000 mg/d, celecoxib, 200 mg/d, and rofecoxib, 12.5 mg, for symptomatic knee OA.",0.15041135251522064
143,2021,20297877,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"The major clinical guidelines recommend the use of acetaminophen (acetyl-para-aminophenol [APAP]) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) and only recommend the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) after APAP failure. This recommendation is based on the efficacy of APAP in treating OA and its relatively benign side-effect profile compared with NSAIDs. NSAIDs are associated with a high risk of adverse events, particularly those of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A large number of studies in OA have compared APAP with a variety of selective and nonselective NSAIDs and typically found greater efficacy with NSAIDs. This advantage, however, is mainly the result of increased efficacy in patients with more severe disease, and is viewed as a relatively small analgesic advantage in some studies and meta-analyses. Many of these same studies have reported little or no difference in safety between APAP and NSAIDs, but these results are typically based on short-term studies. Results from meta-analyses on the safety of NSAIDs almost unanimously confirm elevated risk of GI complications. The analgesic mechanism of APAP is still not well understood. However, the notion that APAP has no anti-inflammatory effect has been challenged in recent years with increasing data that suggest it may have an effect on inflammation distinct from that seen with NSAIDs. A variety of mechanistic hypotheses have been proposed.",0.03581574186682701
143,2021,15478167,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Objective: To perform a meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of recommended dosages of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, versus acetaminophen in the treatment of symptomatic hip and knee osteoarthritis. Methods: Medline and EMBASE searches were performed for original clinical trials directly comparing NSAIDs with acetaminophen. A standardized form was used to abstract all data, including outcome measures of pain at rest, walking pain, and dropouts due to adverse effects. Inverse-variance-weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for pain measures were determined for treatment groups. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated for withdrawals due to adverse events. Results were compared using a random effects model. Results: Seven articles met inclusion criteria with sufficient data for analysis. Participants had a mean age of 61.1 years and 71.1% were women. Test of heterogeneity was not significant for either rest (P = 0.73) or walking (P = 0.76) pain. The scores for overall pain at rest (WMD -6.33 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale [VAS], 95% CI -9.24, -3.41) and walking pain (WMD -5.76 mm on a 100-mm VAS, 95% CI -8.99, -2.52) favored the NSAID-treated group. Although NSAIDs elevated the risk of withdrawals due to adverse events, the difference was not statistically significant (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.93, 2.27). Conclusion: NSAIDs are statistically superior in reducing rest and walking pain compared with acetaminophen for symptomatic osteoarthritis. Safety, measured by discontinuation due to adverse events, was not statistically different between NSAID- and acetaminophen-treated groups.",0.1826360821723938
143,2021,15082468,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Background: Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is recommended as the initial pharmacological treatment for knee or hip osteoarthritis. However, survey and clinical trial data indicate greater efficacy for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 specific inhibitors. Design: Two randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover multicentre clinical trials, Patient Preference for Placebo, Acetaminophen or Celecoxib Efficacy Studies (PACES). Patients: Osteoarthritis of knee or hip. Intervention: ""Wash out"" of treatment; randomisation; 6 weeks of celecoxib 200 mg/day, acetaminophen 1000 mg four times a day, or placebo; second ""wash out;"" crossover to 6 weeks of second treatment. Measurements: Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), visual analogue pain scale, patient preference between two treatments. Results: Celecoxib was more efficacious than acetaminophen in both periods in both studies; WOMAC and pain scale scores differed at p 0.05 in period II and both periods combined of PACES-a and in periods I and II and both periods combined in PACES-b, but not in period I of PACES-a. Acetaminophen was more efficacious than placebo, generally p 0.05 in PACES-b, and &gt;0.05 in PACES-a. Patient preferences were 53% celecoxib v 24% acetaminophen in PACES-a (p 0.001) and 50% v 32% in PACES-b (p = 0.009); 37% acetaminophen v 28% placebo in PACES-a (p = 0.340) and 48% v 24% in PACES-b (p = 0.007). No clinically or statistically significant differences were seen in adverse events or tolerability among the three treatment groups. Conclusions: Greater efficacy was seen for celecoxib v acetaminophen v placebo, while adverse events and tolerability were similar. Variation in results and statistical significance in the two different trials are of interest.",0.22708681225776672
143,2021,17142063,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Objective: To examine the efficacy and safety of two doses of long-acting acetaminophen in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee. Methods: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen extended-release (ER) 650 mg and 1300 mg given three times daily for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe OA of the hip or knee. Primary efficacy end points were mean change from baseline through 12 weeks in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and physical function subscale scores and mean patient global assessment of response to therapy at week 12. Safety assessments included monitoring vital signs, adverse events, study joint assessments, and clinical laboratory results at each study visit. Results: Four hundred eighty-three patients were randomized to treatment and included in the intent-to-treat analysis. All groups were similar with respect to baseline demographics except for gender, weight, and body mass index. Acetaminophen ER 3900 mg was significantly superior to placebo for all three primary end points; acetaminophen ER 1950 mg was significantly superior to placebo only with respect to patient assessment of response to therapy. Study treatments were generally well tolerated, and there was no significant difference among the groups in the overall number of adverse events. Conclusions: Acetaminophen ER 3900 mg/d administered for up to 12 weeks was effective in treating moderate to moderately severe chronic OA pain of the hip or knee and was generally well tolerated.",0.20466949045658112
143,2021,21619937,Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,tylenol osteoarthritis,1.0,"Objective: To identify sources of heterogeneity (statistical, methodological, and clinical) in studies evaluating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) vs acetaminophen in patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) to elucidate variations in outcomes. Method: A database search (1966 to January 2010) was made for (randomized) controlled trials ((R)CTs) comparing NSAIDs vs acetaminophen in knee and hip OA. Extracted data included baseline demographic/clinical characteristics, outcomes at follow-up, and characteristics of study design. Heterogeneity was examined with subgroup analyses by exploring changes in effect size and with I(2) of Higgins. Pain measures were expressed as standardized mean differences. Results: 15 RCTs, including 21 comparisons of NSAIDs and acetaminophen were included. Statistical heterogeneity was absent (Cochran's Q-test=14.11; I(2)=0; P=0.78). Moderate clinical heterogeneity was found for comparisons which included both hip and knee OA vs knee OA only (I(2)=51; P=0.09). NSAIDs seemed slightly more effective than acetaminophen if more patients with hip OA were included. However, the pooled effect sizes of comparisons with knee OA vs both knee and hip OA are equal. Low clinical heterogeneity was found for comparisons with low dosage of acetaminophen, normal dosage of NSAIDs, and moderate pain intensity at baseline. Low methodological heterogeneity was found for comparisons with a short duration. Conclusion: Future trials should present the results of hip and knee OA separately, as moderate clinical heterogeneity was found. There might be differences in effectiveness of NSAIDs vs acetaminophen in patients with hip vs knee OA. No significant methodological and statistical heterogeneity was found in studies evaluating NSAIDs vs acetaminophen.",0.18468621373176575
144,2021,29144545,Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,"Background: Depression is a highly prevalent mood disorder that is characterised by persistent low mood, diminished interest, and loss of pleasure. Music therapy may be helpful in modulating moods and emotions. An update of the 2008 Cochrane review was needed to improve knowledge on effects of music therapy for depression. Objectives: 1. To assess effects of music therapy for depression in people of any age compared with treatment as usual (TAU) and psychological, pharmacological, and/or other therapies.2. To compare effects of different forms of music therapy for people of any age with a diagnosis of depression. Search methods: We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD-CTR; from inception to 6 May 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; to 17 June 2016); Thomson Reuters/Web of Science (to 21 June 2016); Ebsco/PsycInfo, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, and PubMed (to 5 July 2016); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, the National Guideline Clearing House, and OpenGrey (to 6 September 2016); and the Digital Access to Research Theses (DART)-Europe E-theses Portal, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database (to 7 September 2016). We checked reference lists of retrieved articles and relevant systematic reviews and contacted trialists and subject experts for additional information when needed. We updated this search in August 2017 and placed potentially relevant studies in the ""Awaiting classification"" section; we will incorporate these into the next version of this review as appropriate. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing music therapy versus treatment as usual (TAU), psychological therapies, pharmacological therapies, other therapies, or different forms of music therapy for reducing depression. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. Main results: We included in this review nine studies involving a total of 421 participants, 411 of whom were included in the meta-analysis examining short-term effects of music therapy for depression. Concerning primary outcomes, we found moderate-quality evidence of large effects favouring music therapy and TAU over TAU alone for both clinician-rated depressive symptoms (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.69 to -0.27, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 219) and patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -0.85, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.34, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 142). Music therapy was not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU. Regarding secondary outcomes, music therapy plus TAU was superior to TAU alone for anxiety and functioning. Music therapy and TAU was not more effective than TAU alone for improved quality of life (SMD 0.32, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.80, P = 0.20, n = 67, low-quality evidence). We found no significant discrepancies in the numbers of participants who left the study early (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.70, P = 0.26, 5 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 293, moderate-quality evidence). Findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that music therapy added to TAU provides short-term beneficial effects for people with depression if compared to TAU alone. Additionally, we are uncertain about the effects of music therapy versus psychological therapies on clinician-rated depression (SMD -0.78, 95% CI -2.36 to 0.81, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low-quality evidence), patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -1.28, 95% CI -3.75 to 1.02, 4 RCTs, n = 131, low-quality evidence), quality of life (SMD -1.31, 95% CI - 0.36 to 2.99, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low-quality evidence), and leaving the study early (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.49, 4 RCTs, n = 157, moderate-quality evidence). We found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, and anxiety. We do not know whether one form of music therapy is better than another for clinician-rated depressive symptoms (SMD -0.52, 95% CI -1.87 to 0.83, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -1.33 to 1.30, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), quality of life (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -1.57 to 1.08, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), or leaving the study early (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.46, 1 RCT, n = 10). We found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, or anxiety. Authors' conclusions: Findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that music therapy provides short-term beneficial effects for people with depression. Music therapy added to treatment as usual (TAU) seems to improve depressive symptoms compared with TAU alone. Additionally, music therapy plus TAU is not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU alone. Music therapy also shows efficacy in decreasing anxiety levels and improving functioning of depressed individuals.Future trials based on adequate design and larger samples of children and adolescents are needed to consolidate our findings. Researchers should consider investigating mechanisms of music therapy for depression. It is important to clearly describe music therapy, TAU, the comparator condition, and the profession of the person who delivers the intervention, for reproducibility and comparison purposes.",0.39401349425315857
144,2021,18254052,Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,"Background: Depression is a highly prevalent disorder associated with reduced social functioning, impaired quality of life, and increased mortality. Music therapy has been used in the treatment of a variety of mental disorders, but its impact on those with depression is unclear. Objectives: To examine the efficacy of music therapy with standard care compared to standard care alone among people with depression and to compare the effects of music therapy for people with depression against other psychological or pharmacological therapies. Search strategy: CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References were searched on 7/11/2007, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, PsycLit, PSYindex, and other relevant sites were searched in November 2006. Reference lists of retrieved articles were hand searched, as well as specialist music and arts therapies journals. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials comparing music therapy with standard care or other interventions for depression. Data collection and analysis: Data on participants, interventions and outcomes were extracted and entered onto a database independently by two review authors. The methodological quality of each study was also assessed independently by two review authors. The primary outcome was reduction in symptoms of depression, based on a continuous scale. Main results: Five studies met the inclusion criteria of the review. Marked variations in the interventions offered and the populations studied meant that meta-analysis was not appropriate. Four of the five studies individually reported greater reduction in symptoms of depression among those randomised to music therapy than to those in standard care conditions. The fifth study, in which music therapy was used as an active control treatment, reported no significant change in mental state for music therapy compared with standard care. Dropout rates from music therapy conditions appeared to be low in all studies. Authors' conclusions: Findings from individual randomised trials suggest that music therapy is accepted by people with depression and is associated with improvements in mood. However, the small number and low methodological quality of studies mean that it is not possible to be confident about its effectiveness. High quality trials evaluating the effects of music therapy on depression are required.",0.32415300607681274
144,2021,33206656,Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,"Background: We aimed to determine and compare the effects of music therapy and music medicine on depression, and explore the potential factors associated with the effect. Methods: PubMed (MEDLINE), Ovid-Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Clinical Evidence were searched to identify studies evaluating the effectiveness of music-based intervention on depression from inception to May 2020. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were estimated with random-effect model and fixed-effect model. Results: A total of 55 RCTs were included in our meta-analysis. Music therapy exhibited a significant reduction in depressive symptom (SMD = -0.66; 95% CI = -0.86 to -0.46; P 0.001) compared with the control group; while, music medicine exhibited a stronger effect in reducing depressive symptom (SMD = -1.33; 95% CI = -1.96 to -0.70; P 0.001).

Aims To determine the efficacy of music therapy added to standard care compared with standard care only in the treatment of depression among working-age people. Method: Participants (n = 79) with an ICD-10 diagnosis of depression were randomised to receive individual music therapy plus standard care (20 bi-weekly sessions) or standard care only, and followed up at baseline, at 3 months (after intervention) and at 6 months. Clinical measures included depression, anxiety, general functioning, quality of life and alexithymia. Trial registration: ISRCTN84185937. Results: Participants receiving music therapy plus standard care showed greater improvement than those receiving standard care only in depression symptoms (mean difference 4.65, 95% CI 0.59 to 8.70), anxiety symptoms (1.82, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.55) and general functioning (-4.58, 95% CI -8.93 to -0.24) at 3-month follow-up. The response rate was significantly higher for the music therapy plus standard care group than for the standard care only group (odds ratio 2.96, 95% CI 1.01 to 9.02). Conclusions: Individual music therapy combined with standard care is effective for depression among working-age people with depression. The results of this study along with the previous research indicate that music therapy with its specific qualities is a valuable enhancement to established treatment practices.",0.5972476005554199

Method: The study had a prospective, parallel-group design with permuted-block randomization. Older persons with dementia (N = 104) were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. The experimental group received 12 sessions of group music therapy (two 30-min sessions per week for 6 weeks), and the control group received usual care. Data were collected 4 times: (1) 1 week before the intervention, (2) the 6th session of the intervention, (3) the 12th session of the intervention, and (4) 1 month after the final session. Results: Group music therapy reduced depression in persons with dementia. Improvements in depression occurred immediately after music therapy and were apparent throughout the course of therapy. The cortisol level did not significantly decrease after the group music therapy. Cognitive function significantly improved slightly at the 6th session, the 12th session, and 1 month after the sessions ended; in particular, short-term recall function improved. The group music therapy intervention had the greatest impact in subjects with mild and moderate dementia. Conclusion: The group music intervention is a noninvasive and inexpensive therapy that appeared to reduce elders' depression. It also delayed the deterioration of cognitive functions, particularly short-term recall function. Group music therapy may be an appropriate intervention among elderly persons with mild and moderate dementia.",0.39260512590408325

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of music therapy intervention on the autonomic control of heart rate, anxiety, and depression in mothers. Methods: Prospective randomized clinical trial including 21 mothers of preterms admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary hospital, recruited from August 2015 to September 2017, and divided into control group (CG; n = 11) and music therapy group (MTG; n = 10). Participants underwent anxiety and depression evaluation, as well as measurements of the intervals between consecutive heartbeats or RR intervals for the analysis of HRV at the first and the last weeks of hospitalization of their preterms. Music therapy sessions lasting 30-45 min were individually delivered weekly using receptive techniques. The mean and standard deviation of variables were obtained and the normality of data was analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The paired sample t-test or Wilcoxon test were employed to calculate the differences between variables before and after music therapy intervention. The correlations anxiety versus heart variables and depression versus heart variables were established using Spearman correlation test. Fisher's exact test was used to verify the differences between categorical variables. A significance level of p 0.05 was established. Statistical analysis were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 20. Results: Participants in MTG had an average of seven sessions of music therapy, and showed improvement in anxiety and depression scores and autonomic indexes of the time domain (p 0.05). Significant correlations were found between depression and parasympathetic modulation using linear (r = - 0.687; p = 0.028) and nonlinear analyses (r = - 0.689; p = 0.027) in MTG.

144,2021,33664693,Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,"Introduction: There is evidence from earlier trials for the efficacy of music therapy in the treatment of depression among working-age people. Starting therapy sessions with relaxation and revisiting therapeutic themes outside therapy have been deemed promising for outcome enhancement. However, previous music therapy trials have not investigated this issue. Objective: To investigate the efficacy of two enhancers, resonance frequency breathing (RFB) and listening homework (LH), when combined with an established music therapy model (trial registration number ISRCTN11618310). Methods: In a 2 × 2 factorial randomised controlled trial, working-age individuals with depression were allocated into groups based on four conditions derived from either the presence or absence of two enhancers (RFB and LH). All received music therapy over 6 weeks. Outcomes were observed at 6 weeks and 6 months. The primary outcome was the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score. Results: There was a significant overall effect of treatment for the primary outcome favouring the breathing group ( d = 0.50, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.93, p = 0.02). The effect was larger after adjustment for potential confounders ( d = 0.62, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.08, p = 0.009). Treatment effects for secondary outcomes, including anxiety (anxiety scale of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and quality of life (RAND-36), were also significant, favouring the breathing group. The homework enhancer did not reach significant treatment effects. Conclusion: We found that the addition of RFB to a music therapy intervention resulted in enhanced therapeutic outcome for clients with depression.",0.5392773747444153

A recent pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of a new music therapy technique. The aim of this controlled, randomised study was to assess the effects of this new music therapy technique on anxiety and depression in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer-type dementia. Methods: This was a single-centre, comparative, controlled, randomised study, with blinded assessment of its results. The duration of follow-up was 24 weeks. The treated group (n = 15) participated in weekly sessions of individual, receptive music therapy. The musical style of the session was chosen by the patient. The validated 'U' technique was employed. The control group (n = 15) participated under the same conditions in reading sessions. The principal endpoint, measured at weeks 1, 4, 8, 16 and 24, was the level of anxiety (Hamilton Scale). Changes in the depression score (Geriatric Depression Scale) were also analyzed as a secondary endpoint. Results: Significant improvements in anxiety (p 0.01) and depression (p 0.01) were observed in the music therapy group as from week 4 and until week 16. The effect of music therapy was sustained for up to 8 weeks after the discontinuation of sessions between weeks 16 and 24 (p 0.01). Conclusion: These results confirm the valuable effect of music therapy on anxiety and depression in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

The aim of this study was to obtain estimates of effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids in BPD using meta-analysis, with a priori differentiation of affective, impulsive, and cognitive-perceptual symptom domains. Data sources: We performed a literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE, using terms related to BPD and omega-3 fatty acids. Publication date was not a restriction. Study selection: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared omega-3 fatty acids to placebo or any active comparator and pooled data using meta-analysis. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis, describing 4 RCTs testing effects of omega-3 fatty acids in 137 patients with BPD or BPD-related behavior. Data extraction: Using a pre-piloted data extraction form, we obtained data including intervention dose, duration, and BPD symptom scale scores, differentiating affective, impulsive, and cognitive-perceptual symptom domains. Results: Random effects meta-analysis showed an overall significant decreasing effect of omega-3 fatty acids on overall BPD symptom severity (0.54 standardized difference in means [SDM]; 95% CI = 0.91 to 0.17; Z = 2.87; P = .0041), without heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 0.00; Q = 2.63; P = .45).

In a previous 12-week randomized trial we assessed the efficacy of the combination of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with valproic acid, in comparison with valproic acid monotherapy, in 43 BPD outpatients. Combined therapy was superior to valproic acid monotherapy (the control group) in the treatment of some BPD symptoms: impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol, outbursts of anger, and self-harm. The present study is a 24-week follow-up aimed at evaluating whether the differences in efficacy between the two subgroups were maintained after discontinuation of omega-3 fatty acids. Methods: Thirty-four patients who completed the 12-week trial entered the follow-up study. Participants were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the follow-up period using the rating scales that showed a significant difference between the groups after the 12-week trial with fatty acids supplementation: the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI) (items 'impulsivity' and 'outbursts of anger'), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Version 11 (BIS-11), and Self Harm Inventory (SHI). Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Results: At the end of the follow-up a significant difference within groups was maintained for all four variables examined, while a significant difference between groups was maintained for outbursts of anger. Concerning tolerability, no clinically significant adverse effects were registered during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Combined therapy with omega-3 fatty acids showed long-lasting effects after discontinuation in terms of anger control.

145,2021,27472373,Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,omega 3 borderline personality disorder,1.0,"A new application for omega-3 fatty acids has recently emerged, concerning the treatment of several mental disorders. This indication is supported by data of neurobiological research, as highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) are highly concentrated in neural phospholipids and are important components of the neuronal cell membrane. They modulate the mechanisms of brain cell signaling, including the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways. The aim of this review is to provide a complete and updated account of the empirical evidence of the efficacy and safety that are currently available for omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The main evidence for the effectiveness of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been obtained in mood disorders, in particular in the treatment of depressive symptoms in unipolar and bipolar depression. There is some evidence to support the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of conditions characterized by a high level of impulsivity and aggression and borderline personality disorders. In patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, small-to-modest effects of omega-3 HUFAs have been found. The most promising results have been reported by studies using high doses of EPA or the association of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. In schizophrenia, current data are not conclusive and do not allow us either to refuse or support the indication of omega-3 fatty acids. For the remaining psychiatric disturbances, including autism spectrum disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders and substance use disorder, the data are too scarce to draw any conclusion.

145,2021,20556762,Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,omega 3 borderline personality disorder,1.0,"Background: Drugs are widely used in borderline personality disorder (BPD) treatment, chosen because of properties known from other psychiatric disorders (""off-label use""), mostly targeting affective or impulsive symptom clusters. Objectives: To assess the effects of drug treatment in BPD patients. Search strategy: We searched bibliographic databases according to the Cochrane Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems Group strategy up to September 2009, reference lists of articles, and contacted researchers in the field. Selection criteria: Randomised studies comparing drug versus placebo, or drug versus drug(s) in BPD patients. Outcomes included total BPD severity, distinct BPD symptom facets according to DSM-IV criteria, associated psychopathology not specific to BPD, attrition and adverse effects. Data collection and analysis: Two authors selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data, independently. Main results: Twenty-eight trials involving a total of 1742 trial participants were included. First-generation antipsychotics (flupenthixol decanoate, haloperidol, thiothixene); second-generation antipsychotics (aripirazole, olanzapine, ziprasidone), mood stabilisers (carbamazepine, valproate semisodium, lamotrigine, topiramate), antidepressants (amitriptyline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, phenelzine sulfate, mianserin), and dietary supplementation (omega-3 fatty acid) were tested. First-generation antipsychotics were subject to older trials, whereas recent studies focussed on second-generation antipsychotics and mood stabilisers. Data were sparse for individual comparisons, indicating marginal effects for first-generation antipsychotics and antidepressants.The findings were suggestive in supporting the use of second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and omega-3 fatty acids, but require replication, since most effect estimates were based on single studies. The long-term use of these drugs has not been assessed.Adverse event data were scarce, except for olanzapine. There was a possible increase in self-harming behaviour, significant weight gain, sedation and changes in haemogram parameters with olanzapine. A significant decrease in body weight was observed with topiramate treatment. All drugs were well tolerated in terms of attrition.Direct drug comparisons comprised two first-generation antipsychotics (loxapine versus chlorpromazine), first-generation antipsychotic against antidepressant (haloperidol versus amitriptyline; haloperidol versus phenelzine sulfate), and second-generation antipsychotic against antidepressant (olanzapine versus fluoxetine). Data indicated better outcomes for phenelzine sulfate but no significant differences in the other comparisons, except olanzapine which showed more weight gain and sedation than fluoxetine. The only trial testing single versus combined drug treatment (olanzapine versus olanzapine plus fluoxetine; fluoxetine versus fluoxetine plus olanzapine) yielded no significant differences in outcomes. Authors' conclusions: The available evidence indicates some beneficial effects with second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and dietary supplementation by omega-3 fatty acids. However, these are mostly based on single study effect estimates. Antidepressants are not widely supported for BPD treatment, but may be helpful in the presence of comorbid conditions. Total BPD severity was not significantly influenced by any drug. No promising results are available for the core BPD symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance and abandonment. Conclusions have to be drawn carefully in the light of several limitations of the RCT evidence that constrain applicability to everyday clinical settings (among others, patients' characteristics and duration of interventions and observation periods).",0.11330094933509827

Aims: To evaluate the evidence of effectiveness of pharmacotherapy in treating different facets of the psychopathology of borderline personality disorder. Method: A Cochrane Collaboration systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised comparisons of drug v. placebo, drug v. drug, or single drug v. combined drug treatment in adult patients with borderline personality disorder was conducted. Primary outcomes were overall disorder severity as well as specific core symptoms. Secondary outcomes comprised associated psychiatric pathology and drug tolerability. Results: Twenty-seven trials were included in which first- and second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, antidepressants and omega-3 fatty acids were tested. Most beneficial effects were found for the mood stabilisers topiramate, lamotrigine and valproate semisodium, and the second-generation antipsychotics aripiprazole and olanzapine. However, the robustness of findings is low, since they are based mostly on single, small studies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors so far lack high-level evidence of effectiveness. Conclusions: The current evidence from randomised controlled trials suggests that drug treatment, especially with mood stabilisers and second-generation antipsychotics, may be effective for treating a number of core symptoms and associated psychopathology, but the evidence does not currently support effectiveness for overall severity of borderline personality disorder. Pharmacotherapy should therefore be targeted at specific symptoms.",0.15380491316318512

The total sample size comprised of 96 children with asthma from the time period between May 2015 to April 2016. At the same time, 96 healthy children were also selected from the physical examination center for comparison study. The levels of serum VitD in both groups were detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pulmonary function index that includes the measurement of FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, MEF25 and MEF50 were performed to analyze the results. The patients in the control group were treated with only the budesonide therapy and the patients in the observation group were treated with atomization inhalation of budesonide combined with salbutamol and VitD supplementation. After the treatment, the levels of inflammatory cell indicators (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IFN-γ) and pulmonary function in the two groups were compared. The levels of serum VitD in the children with asthma were significantly lower than those in the normal children. The serum IgE level in children with asthma was significantly higher than that in the normal children (P 0.05). Pearson correlation coefficient analyses showed that VitD levels were not correlated with FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC levels (P&gt;0.05), but was positively correlated with MEF25 and MEF50 (P 0.05). After the treatment, the levels of IL-2 and IFN-γ in the observation group were significantly higher and levels of IL-4 and IL-6 were significantly lower than those in the control group (P 0.05). The pulmonary function (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, MEF25 and MEF50) of the observation group was better than that of the control group (P 0.05).

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the association of vit D, vit D-binding protein (VDBP) and cathelicidin with acute asthma attacks among children with allergic asthma. Methods: This prospective study included 35 patients with acute asthma attack and 32 children with controlled asthma, and all were matched by sampling season, sensitization to mites, and previous severity of asthma. A comprehensive questionnaire about risk factors, blood sampling for 25-hydroxyvitamin D vit D, VDBP, and cathelicidin levels; spirometric indices were used. Factors that influence serum vit D and cathelicidin levels and the development of asthma attacks were evaluated with multivariate analysis. Results: The mean serum vit D levels of the attack group was significantly lower than that of the controlled asthma group (p 0.001). The mean cathelicidin level was significantly higher in the acute asthma group than with the controlled subjects with asthma (p = 0.002). There was no difference between the acute and controlled asthma groups in terms of markers of allergy and serum VDBP levels. Risk factors that may influence vit D levels revealed that body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.038), duration of sun exposure (p 0.001), and amount of dietary vit D (p 0.001) independently affected serum vit D levels. Risk factors that may result in acute asthma showed that low serum levels of vit D were significantly related to the risk of asthma attacks (p 0.001, adjusted odds ratio 16.11). Cathelicidin levels showed a significant positive association with asthma attacks and BMI. Conclusions: Vit D deficiency showed a significant relationship to the development of asthma attacks independent of cathelicidin deficiency and other factors associated with the severity of chronic asthma.",0.3111136257648468

We aimed to systematically synthesise the evidence on the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation in childhood asthma. Methods: We searched electronic databases (Medline, Embase and Web of Science) and a register (CENTRAL) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published until 30 September 2021. RCTs enrolling asthmatic children (1-18 years old) and comparing vitamin D against placebo/routine care were included if they met at least one of the endpoints of interest (asthma attacks, emergency visits or hospitalisation). We used the Risk of Bias 2 tool for risk of bias assessment. Random-effects meta-analysis with RevMan 5.3 software was performed. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to assess the level of certainty of the evidence. Results: 18 RCTs (1579 participants) were included. The pooled meta-analysis did not find a significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on asthma attacks requiring rescue systemic corticosteroids (six studies with 445 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% CI 0.86-1.48; I<sup>2</sup>=0%) (moderate-certainty evidence). In addition, there was no significant difference in the proportion of children with asthma attacks of any severity (11 trials with 1132 participants; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65-1.09; I<sup>2</sup>=58%) (very low-certainty evidence). Vitamin D does not reduce the need for emergency visits (three studies with 361 participants; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89-1.07; I<sup>2</sup>=0%) and hospitalisation (RR: 1.38, 95% CI 0.52-3.66; I<sup>2</sup>=0%) (low-certainty evidence).

146,2021,35380750,Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,vitamin d asthma attacks,1.0,"Background: Globally, the number of diagnosed asthma has increased by 4.3 million from 2001 to 2009.The prevalence of asthma in Africa has increased from 64.9 million (11.8%)to 102.9 million (13.8%) over the past two decades among children less than 15 years. The burden of this consequence is the exacerbations of attacks with resultant absence from school by children, loss of man hour by parents who stay with them while on admission as well as increased healthcare expenditures. The association between the serum level of vitamin D with the severity of the asthmatic attack and its control has been reported in respect of its role as a significant immunomodulator and inhibition in the pathogenesis of allergies. The aim of the study was to correlate serum 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D with the severity of Asthmatic attack in children and possibly provide a rationale for clinical supplementation. Materials and methods: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study conducted between November 2016and August 2017 involving 128 participants. A stratified random sampling method was used to select the participants based on control a level using the GINA classification of asthma control levels. Serum vitamin D level was determined by CalbiotechInc, kit and Pearson correlation was carried out to determine relationship. Results: The uncontrolled (22.4±2.9ng/mL) and partly controlled (25.6±3.9ng/mL) groups had low serum vitamin D levels as compared to the well-controlled group (35.1±4.9ng/mL) which had vitamin D within the reference interval. There was a strong negative correlation (p-value 0.001) between serum vitamin D levels and all the criteria (GINA) of asthma control. Conclusion: The serum vitamin D levels correlated well with the severity of an asthmatic attack as well as its control (GINA).",0.6922972202301025
146,2021,27818797,Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,vitamin d asthma attacks,1.0,"Background . Serum magnesium levels affect the concentration of circulating vitamin D in blood and subsequently it affects the immunity; thus it plays significant role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Asthma, in adults, is less studied and hypomagnesemia along with vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is common in asthmatic individuals, which causes frequent asthma attacks, respiratory infections, severe exacerbations, and poor response to bronchodilators. Objective . To detect the magnitude of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency and serum magnesium levels among asthmatic patients and to correlate them with the severity of asthma. Materials and Methods . This is a cross-sectional case-control study which includes 60 patients of chronic stable asthma and 60 healthy controls. After taking clinical history and systemic examination, pulmonary function test was done. Serum levels of magnesium, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D], and calcium were measured in all the subjects. Results . Significant correlation was found between vitamin D deficiency, hypomagnesemia, and asthma severity. Serum calcium levels were unaffected by that. Conclusion . Vitamin D and serum magnesium deficiency are highly prevalent in patients with asthma. Increased asthma severity, frequency of attacks, and exacerbation are associated with lower levels of one or both. Serum 25(OH)D and magnesium levels may serve as important markers of asthma severity.",0.6178914308547974
146,2021,31278171,Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,vitamin d asthma attacks,1.0,"Introduction: Vitamin D is best known for its role in bone health; however, the discovery of the vitamin D receptor and the expression of the gene encoding the vitamin D 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) enzyme in a wide variety of tissues including immune cells and respiratory epithelium has led to the discovery of potential roles for vitamin D in the prevention of acute wheeze. Methods: We review here the literature concerning the relationships between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration and secondary prevention of acute wheeze attacks in preschool and school-age children. Results: Epidemiological data suggest that vitamin D insufficiency (25(OH)D 75 nmol/L) is highly prevalent in preschool and school-age children with wheeze. Preschool age children with a history of wheeze attacks and circulating 25(OH)D 75 nmol/L are at increased risk and frequency of future acute wheeze. However, no consistent association between low vitamin D status and risk of acute wheeze is reported in school-age children. Seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with relatively small sample sizes (30-430) and variable quality showed inconsistent results regarding the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation during childhood on the risk of asthma attacks, asthma symptom control, inhaled corticosteroid requirements, spirometry and unscheduled healthcare attendances for wheeze. A RCT showed that vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the frequency of unplanned healthcare attendances due to acute wheeze in 22 preschool children. Discussion: An evidence-based recommendation for the use of vitamin D as a preventive therapy for wheeze attacks cannot be made until results of further trials are available. The assessment of circulating 25(OH)D concentration and the optimisation of vitamin D status to prevent acute respiratory tract infections, and to maintain skeletal and general health in preschool and school-age children with acute wheeze is worthwhile in its own right, but whether this will reduce the risk of acute wheeze attacks is unclear.",0.12426760047674179
146,2021,33154023,Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,vitamin d asthma attacks,1.0,"Background: The relationship between asthma and vitamin D deficiency has been known for some time. However, interventional studies conducted in this regard have shown conflicting results. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in asthmatic patients in improving the degree of control of asthma. Methods: Randomised, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adult asthmatic patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D 3 30 ng/mL. The intervention group received oral supplementation with 16 000 IU of calcifediol per week, and the control group had placebo added to their usual asthma treatment. The study period was 6 months. The primary endpoint was the degree of asthma control as determined by the asthma control test (ACT). Secondary endpoints included quality of life measured using the mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, the number of asthma attacks, oral corticosteroid cycles, the dose of inhaled corticosteroids, number of emergency visits, unscheduled consultations with the primary care physician and hospitalisations for asthma. Results: One hundred and twelve patients were randomised (mean age 55 years, with 87 (78%) being women). Of the 112 patients, 106 (95%) completed the trial. Half the patients (56) were assigned to the intervention group and the other half to the control group. A statistically significant clinical improvement was observed in the intervention group (+3.09) compared with the control group (-0.57) (difference 3.66 (95% CI 0.89 to 5.43); p 0.001) as measured using ACT scores. Among the secondary endpoints, a significant improvement in the quality of life was found in the intervention group (5.34), compared with the control group (4.64) (difference 0.7 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.25); p=0.01).

146,2021,26841365,Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,vitamin d asthma attacks,1.0,"Background: In our prior randomized trial on preventing influenza, asthma attacks as a secondary outcome occurred less often in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group. We aimed to clarify whether low-dose, short-term vitamin D supplementation, in addition to standard treatments, improves control of childhood asthma. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing vitamin D3 supplements (800 IU/day) with placebo for 2 months in schoolchildren with asthma. The primary outcomes were frequency and severity of asthma judging from changes in asthma control levels defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) by collaborating doctors at 2 and 6 months. Results: Japanese schoolchildren with asthma (n = 89) were randomly assigned to receive vitamin D (n = 54) or placebo (n = 35). At 2 months, GINA asthma control was significantly more improved in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.015). Childhood asthma control test (CACT) scores, a secondary outcome, were also significantly (P = 0.004) improved in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group at 2 months, and differences remained significant (P = 0.012) at 6 months. The proportion of patients with a peak expiratory flow rate 80% predicted was significantly less in the vitamin D group (8/54: 15%) than in the placebo group (12/35: 34%) at 6 months (P = 0.032).

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association of innate and adaptive immunity with acute asthma attacks by analysing the role of IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D and cytokines. Material and methods: This prospective study included 33 patients with viral-induced acute asthma and 30 children with controlled asthma. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected for virus identification and asthma attack scores assessed in acute asthma group. Blood sampling for IP-10, TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D levels, and spirometric indices were employed. Results: Serum IP-10 and cathelicidin levels of acute asthma group were significantly higher and vitamin D levels were lower than controlled asthma group (IP-10; p=0.006, cathelicidin; p=0.002, vitamin D; p 0.001). Serum IP-10 levels showed a significant negative correlation with age (p=0.009), TLR2 (p=0.05) and spirometric indices (p=0.002) in all asthmatics and a significant positive correlation with parameters of asthma attack severity (p=0.03) in acute asthma group. Higher cathelicidin values showed significant positive relation to IP-10 (beta coefficient: 33, p=0.02). Serum IP-10 levels higher than 38.9pg/ml (sensitivity: 85%, specificity: 47%, p=0.002) were predictive of virus-induced asthma.

An optimal serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25-OH-VitD) level in pediatric asthma patients might not rely solely on the effect of dose-dependent vitamin D 3 intake, but might also be influenced by factors related to insufficient asthma control. We aimed to survey the prevalence of serum 25-OH-VitD deficiency and analyze whether suboptimal levels were associated with asthma severity factors. The current cross-sectional study enrolled 131 pediatric asthma or asthma-suggestive recurrent wheezing patients, for whom serum 25-OH-VitD, IgE, and eosinophil count were assessed. The prevalence of suboptimal serum 25-OH-VitD was 58.8%. A suboptimal vitamin D status was associated with asthma exacerbation in the previous month ( p = 0.02). Even under seasonal oral vitamin D 3 supplementation, patients with a positive history of asthma attack in the previous four weeks presented significantly lower serum 25-OH-VitD concentrations, compared to their peers with no disease exacerbation.

Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compare the use of an adapted soy formula to human milk, an adapted cow's milk or a hydrolysed protein formula for infant feeding in the first 6 months. Only trials with &gt; 80% follow up of participants and reported in group of assignment were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Eligibility of studies for inclusion, methodological quality and data extraction were assessed independently by each reviewer. Primary outcomes included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food intolerance. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed effects model where no heterogeneity of treatment effect existed, and a random effects model when heterogeneity was found. Main results: Five eligible studies were found, all enrolling infants at high risk of allergy on the basis of a family history of allergy in a first degree relative. All studies compared use of a soy to a cow's milk formula. Two studies also included a group fed a formula containing hydrolysed protein. No eligible study enrolled infants fed human milk. No study examined the effect of early, short term soy formula feeding. Three studies were of good methodology and did not have unbalanced allergy-preventing co-interventions in the treatment groups. Comparing soy to cow's milk formula, one study with unclear allocation concealment and 19.5% losses to follow up reported a reduction in cumulative incidence of childhood allergy, asthma and allergic rhinitis.

Objective: Through a randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether the early introduction of cow's milk formula (CMF) could serve as an effective strategy in the primary prevention of CMA in a general population. Methods: We recruited newborns from 4 hospitals in Okinawa, Japan. Participants were randomly allocated to ingest at least10 mL of CMF daily (ingestion group) or avoid CMF (avoidance group) between 1 and 2 months of age. In the avoidance group breast-feeding was supplemented with soy formula as needed. Oral food challenge was performed at 6 months of age to assess CMA development. Continuous breast-feeding was recommended for both groups until 6 months of age. Results: We identified 504 infants for randomization into the 2 groups. In all, the parents of 12 participants declined to receive the intervention, and the study sample comprised 491 participants (242 in the ingestion group and 249 in the avoidance group) for a modified intention-to-treat analysis. There were 2 CMA cases (0.8%) among the 242 members of the ingestion group and 17 CMA cases (6.8%) among the 249 participants in the avoidance group (risk ratio = 0.12; 95% CI = 0.01-0.50; P .001). The risk difference was 6.0% (95% CI = 2.7-9.3). Approximately 70% of the participants in both groups were still being breast-fed at 6 months of age.

Key recommendations for healthcare bodies in Europe and the United States include: • Allergy prevention in at-risk infants (parent or sibling with allergy): Currently, there is a consensus of healthcare organizations around the world that the recommended exclusive breastfeeding duration is the first 6 months of life for the overall health benefit of the baby. Allergy prevention in non-breastfed infants at risk: There are studies showing that fully hydrolyzed formula can reduce the risk of allergic reactions, especially atopic dermatitis, in high-risk non-breastfed babies. Some recommendations for high-risk non-breastfed infants support feeding up to 4 to 6 months with hydrolyzed formulas. Further research is needed on this subject. Soy formulas failed to prevent allergy in high-risk infants. • In case of cow's milk allergy symptoms in breastfed babies: Although a small amount of food allergens may be present in the milk, mothers should be encouraged to continue breastfeeding while avoiding consumption of cow's milk and products. • In case of cow's milk allergy symptoms in non-breastfed babies: Under six months of age, extensively hydrolyzed formula is suitable for most cases of cow's milk allergy, except for severe clinical conditions, which require amino acid formulas. Over six months, soy formulas can be considered. Exposure to solid foods: The current recommendations are to start on solids at the age of 4-6 months and there is no recommendation for avoiding known allergens, despite family history. Later introduction of peanut, fish or egg does not prevent, and may even increase, the risk of developing food allergy.

An appropriate cow's milk (CM) substitute is necessary for feeding babies with CMA. CM substitutes are soy formulas and casein- or whey-based extensively hydrolyzed formulas. In several countries, including Italy, goat's milk (GM) formulas are available, and some physicians recommend them for feeding babies with CMA. Objective: We sought to investigate, in vitro and in vivo, the allergenicity of GM in 26 children with proven IgE-mediated CMA. Methods: All the children underwent skin tests with CM and GM; detection of specific serum IgE to CM and GM; and double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral food challenges (DBPCOFCs) with fresh CM, GM, and, as placebo, a soy formula (Isomil, Abbott, Italy). CAP inhibition and immunoblotting inhibition assays were also carried out in 1 of 26 and 4 of 26 children with positive RAST results to both CM and GM, respectively. Results: All the children had positive skin test responses and CAP results to both CM and GM, all had positive DBPCOFC results to CM, and 24 of 26 had positive DBPCOFCs to GM. In CAP inhibition tests, preincubation of serum with CM or GM strongly inhibited IgE either to CM or to GM. In immunoblotting inhibition assays, preincubation with CM completely extinguished reactivity to GM, whereas GM partially inhibited reactivity to CM. Conclusions: These data strongly indicate that GM is not an appropriate CM substitute for children with IgE-mediated CMA. A warning on the lack of safety of GM for children with CMA should be on the label of GM formulas to prevent severe allergic reactions in babies with CMA.",0.07900163531303406
147,2021,24504215,Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,baby soy formula prevent allergies,0.0,"Due to the recent exponential increase in food allergies and atopic disorders, effective allergy prevention has become a public health priority in many developed regions. Important preventive strategies include the promotion of breastfeeding and vaginal deliveries, judicious use of perinatal antibiotics, as well as the avoidance of maternal tobacco smoking. Breastfeeding for at least 6 months and introduction of complementary solids from 4-6 months are generally recommended. Complex oligosaccharides in breast milk support the establishment of bifidobacteria in the neonatal gut which stimulate regulatory T lymphocyte responses and enhance tolerance development. Maternal elimination diets during pregnancy or lactation are not effective in preventing allergies. If exclusive breastfeeding is not possible, (supplemental) feeding with a partially hydrolyzed whey-based formula or extensively hydrolyzed casein-based formula may reduce the risk of cow's milk allergy and atopic dermatitis in infants with a family history of atopy. By contrast, asthma and allergic rhinitis at 4-6 years of age are not prevented by this approach. Soy formula and amino acid-based formula have no proven role in allergy prevention. Perinatal supplementation with probiotics and/or prebiotics may reduce the risk of atopic dermatitis, but no reliable effect on the prevention of food allergy or respiratory allergies has so far been found. A randomized trial on maternal fish oil supplementation during pregnancy found that atopic dermatitis and egg sensitization in the first year of life were significantly reduced, but no preventive effect for food allergies was demonstrated.

Objective: To determine whether feeding infants pHWF reduces their risk of allergic disease. Methods: A single-blind (participant) randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare allergic outcomes between infants fed a conventional cow's milk formula, a pHWF, or a soy formula. Before birth, 620 infants with a family history of allergic disease were recruited and randomized to receive the allocated formula at cessation of breast-feeding. Skin prick tests to 6 common allergens (milk, egg, peanut, dust mite, rye grass, and cat dander) were performed at 6, 12, and 24 months. The primary outcome was development of allergic manifestations (eczema and food reactions) measured 18 times in the first 2 years of life. Results: Follow-up was complete for 93% (575/620) at 2 years and 80% (495/620) at 6 or 7 years of age. There was no evidence that infants allocated to the pHWF (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.81-1.80) or the soy formula (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.84-1.88) were at a lower risk of allergic manifestations in infancy compared with conventional formula. There was also no evidence of reduced risk of skin prick test reactivity or childhood allergic disease. Conclusion: Despite current dietary guidelines, we found no evidence to support recommending the use of pHWF at weaning for the prevention of allergic disease in high-risk infants.",0.05611259490251541
147,2021,28698533,Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,baby soy formula prevent allergies,0.0,"Introduction: The prevention and management of cow milk allergy (CMA) is still debated. Since CMA is much less frequent in breastfed infants, breastfeeding should be stimulated. Method: Literature was searched using databases to find original papers and reviews on this topic. Results: Hydrolysates with a clinical proof of efficacy are recommended in the prevention and treatment of CMA. However, not all meta-analyses conclude that hydrolysates do prevent CMA or other atopic manifestations such as atopic dermatitis. There are pros and cons to consider partially hydrolysed protein as an option for starter infant formula for each non-exclusively breastfed infant. A challenge test is still recommended as the most specific and sensitive diagnostic test, although a positive challenge test does not proof that the immune system is involved. The Cow Milk Symptom Score (CoMiSS™) is an awareness tool that enables healthcare professionals to better recognize symptoms related to the ingestion of cow milk, but it still needs validation as diagnostic tool. The current recommended elimination diet is a cow milk based extensive hydrolysate, although rice hydrolysates or soy infant formula can be considered in some cases. About 10 to 15% of infants allergic to cow milk will also react to soy. Mainly because of the higher cost, amino acid based formula is reserved for severe cases. There is no place for infant formula with intact protein from other animals as cross-over allergenicity is high. During recent years, attention focused also on the bifidogenic effect of prebiotics and more recently also on human milk oligosaccharides. A bifidogenic gastrointestinal microbiome may decrease the risk to develop allergic disease. The addition of probiotics and prebiotics to the elimination diet in treatment may enhance the development of tolerance development. Conclusion: Breastfeeding is the best way to feed infants. Cow milk based extensive hydrolysates remain the first option for the treatment of CMA for the majority of patients, while amino acid formulas are reserved for the most severe cases. Rice hydrolysates and soy infant formula are second choice options. Partial hydrolysates with clinical proof of efficacy are recommended in some guidelines in the prevention of CMA and allergic disease in at risk infants, and may be considered as an option as protein source in starter infant formula.",0.06460817158222198
147,2021,33710678,Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,baby soy formula prevent allergies,0.0,"Background: This guideline from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) recommends approaches to prevent the development of immediate-onset / IgE-mediated food allergy in infants and young children. It is an update of a 2014 EAACI guideline. Methods: The guideline was developed using the AGREE II framework and the GRADE approach. An international Task Force with representatives from 11 countries and different disciplinary and clinical backgrounds systematically reviewed research and considered expert opinion. Recommendations were created by weighing up benefits and harms, considering the certainty of evidence and examining values, preferences and resource implications. The guideline was peer-reviewed by external experts, and feedback was incorporated from public consultation. Results: All of the recommendations about preventing food allergy relate to infants (up to 1 year) and young children (up to 5 years), regardless of risk of allergy. There was insufficient evidence about preventing food allergy in other age groups. The EAACI Task Force suggests avoiding the use of regular cow's milk formula as supplementary feed for breastfed infants in the first week of life. The EAACI Task Force suggests introducing well-cooked, but not raw egg or uncooked pasteurized, egg into the infant diet as part of complementary feeding. In populations where there is a high prevalence of peanut allergy, the EAACI Task Force suggests introducing peanuts in an age-appropriate form as part of complementary feeding. According to the studies, it appears that the most effective age to introduce egg and peanut is from four to 6 months of life. The EAACI Task Force suggests against the following for preventing food allergy: (i) avoiding dietary food allergens during pregnancy or breastfeeding; and (ii) using soy protein formula in the first 6 months of life as a means of preventing food allergy. There is no recommendation for or against the following: use of vitamin supplements, fish oil, prebiotics, probiotics or synbiotics in pregnancy, when breastfeeding or in infancy; altering the duration of exclusive breastfeeding; and hydrolysed infant formulas, regular cow's milk-based infant formula after a week of age or use of emollients. Conclusions: Key changes from the 2014 guideline include suggesting (i) the introduction of peanut and well-cooked egg as part of complementary feeding (moderate certainty of evidence) and (ii) avoiding supplementation with regular cow's milk formula in the first week of life (low certainty of evidence). There remains uncertainty in how to prevent food allergy, and further well-powered, multinational research using robust diagnostic criteria is needed.",0.1757722795009613
147,2021,17414508,Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,baby soy formula prevent allergies,0.0,"Purpose of review: This review discusses the safety, nutritional adequacy and recommendations for use of soy protein formulae, based mainly on the most relevant reports published during 2005 and 2006. Recent findings: Concerns have recently been raised regarding potential risks with soy protein formulae, in particular regarding their high phytoestrogenic isoflavone content. Recent data are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions on safety, but authorities and paediatric societies from several countries recently advised health professionals to use soy protein formulae only in certain cases. Indications for use of soy protein formulae, mainly for prevention and management of food allergy, have also been better defined. Summary: Soy protein formulae ensure normal growth and development in healthy term infants but they have no nutritional advantages over cow's milk protein formulae. Main indications include severe lactose intolerance, galactosaemia and need to avoid foods of animal origin. Soy protein formulae have no role in preventing allergy or in management of nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. infantile colic and regurgitation). They should not be used in preterm infants or infants with food allergy before age 6 months. After 6 months, soy protein formulae may be considered if tolerance to soy protein is established.",0.05660561844706535

Included were randomized controlled trials of chitosan with a minimum duration of 4 weeks in adults who were overweight or obese and/or had hypercholesterolaemia at baseline. Fourteen trials involving a total of 1071 participants were included in the review. Analyses involving all trials indicated that chitosan preparations result in a small but statistically significant greater reduction in body weight (weighted mean difference -1.7 kg; 95% confidence interval -2.1, -1.3 kg, P 0.00001) compared with placebo. Analyses restricted to high-quality studies showed that reductions in weight [-0.6 (-1.2, 0.1) kg, P = 0.11] were less than in lower quality studies [-2.3 (-2.7, -1.8) kg, P 0.00001].

Although evaluated in a number of trials, its efficacy remains in dispute. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of chitosan for weight loss in overweight and obese adults. Design and setting: A 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted at the University of Auckland between November 2001 and December 2002. Participants: A total of 250 participants (82% women; mean (s.d.) body mass index, 35.5 (5.1) kg/m(2); mean age, 48 (12) y) Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 3 g chitosan/day (n=125) or placebo (n=125). All participants received standardised dietary and lifestyle advice for weight loss. Adherence was monitored by capsule counts. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was change in body weight. Secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage, blood pressure, serum lipids, plasma glucose, fat-soluble vitamins, faecal fat, and health-related quality of life. Results: In an intention-to-treat analysis with the last observation carried forward, the chitosan group lost more body weight than the placebo group (mean (s.e.), -0.4 (0.2) kg (0.4% loss) vs +0.2 (0.2) kg (0.2% gain), P=0.03) during the 24-week intervention, but effects were small. Similar small changes occurred in circulating total and LDL cholesterol, and glucose (P 0.01). There were no significant differences between groups for any of the other measured outcomes.

The published articles mention as secondary possible benefits of usage of chitosan the improvement of blood pressure and serum lipids status. We performed a meta-analysis evaluating body weight, body mass index, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure among overweight and obese patients. Materials and Methods: Searching MEDLINE, Cochrane up to December 2017 on clinical trials that have assessed the influence of chitosan used as a dietary supplement on overweight and obese patients. An additional study was identified in the References section of another meta-analysis. A total of 14 randomised control trials (RCT) were used to assess the effect on body weight, serum lipids and blood pressure. Results: The usage of chitosan as a dietary supplement up to 52 weeks seems to slightly reduce the body weight (-1.01 kg, 95% CI: -1.67 to -0.34). Considering the other parameters studied, the most significant improvement was observed in systolic and diastolic blood pressure: -2.68 mm Hg (95% CI: -4.19 to -1.18) and -2.14 mm Hg (95% CI: -4.14 to -0.14) in favour of chitosan versus a placebo.

148,2021,15635349,Does chitosan help lose body weight?,chitosan weight loss,0.0,"Objective: Chitosan is a primary ingredient in dietary weight-loss supplements. Its claimed activity is the binding and trapping of dietary fat, leading to fat excretion and weight loss without caloric restriction. We tested the fat-trapping capacity of a chitosan product in men and women. Design: Participants (12 men, 12 women) were instructed to follow customized diet plans (five meals/day for 12 days). Oral charcoal markers defined two 4-day experimental periods. Two capsules were taken five times per day before each meal during the supplement period (2.5 g chitosan/day) and not during the control period. Feces were collected from day 2 to day 12. Feces from each period were pooled and analyzed for fat content. Results: For men (mean+/-standard deviation=24.8+/-5.1 years, body mass index [BMI; calculated as kg/m 2 ] 26.6+/-4.5) the average daily was 137+/-31 g fat and 3,256+/-624 kcal. For women (23.3+/-5.0 years, BMI 24.1+/-3.5) average daily 89+/-16 g fat and 2,110+/-195 kcal. Each two-capsule dose was consumed with 28+/-11 g fat in males and 18+/-7 g in females (range =10-76 g/dose). Fecal fat excretion increased with chitosan by 1.8+/-2.4 g/day in males, P =.02, and did not increase with chitosan (0.0+/-1.4 g/day, P =.99) in females.

148,2021,26747458,Does chitosan help lose body weight?,chitosan weight loss,0.0,"Background: Chitosan is a dietary fibre which acts by reducing fat absorption and thus used as a means for controlling weight. Weight loss clinical trial outcomes, however, have contradictory results regarding its efficacy. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a chitosan from fungal origin in treatment of excess weight in the absence of dietary restrictions. Methods: A phase IV, randomised, multicentre, single-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study was conducted by administering chitosan capsules (500 mg, five/day) and indistinguishable placebo capsules as daily supplements to 96 overweight and obese subjects for 90 days. The study participants were divided in 2:1 ratio to receive either chitosan (n = 64) or placebo (n = 32). Efficacy was assessed by measuring body weight, body composition parameters, anthropometric measurements, HbA1C level and lipid profile at day 45 and day 90. Also, short form-36 quality of life (QoL) questionnaire was assessed to evaluate improvement in life-style and dietary habits were recorded for calorie intake. Safety was assessed by evaluating safety parameters and monitoring adverse events. Results: The mean changes in body weight were -1.78 ± 1.37 kg and -3.10 ± 1.95 kg at day 45 and day 90 respectively in chitosan group which were significantly different (p 0.0001) as compared to placebo. BMI was decreased by10.91 fold compared to placebo after 90 day administration. In concert with this, there was also reduction in body composition and anthropometric parameters together with improvement in QoL score. Chitosan was also able to reduce HbA1C levels (below 6 %) in subjects who had initial higher values. The mean caloric intake shows that there was no change in dietary habits of subjects in both groups. Lipid levels were unaffected and all adverse events were mild in nature and unrelated to study treatment. Conclusion: Chitosan from fungal origin was able to reduce the mean body weight up to 3 kg during the 90 day study period. Together with this, there was also improvement in body composition, anthropometric parameters and HbA1C, reflecting overall benefits for the overweight individuals. Additionally, there was also improvement in QoL score. It was safe and well tolerated by all subjects. Trial registration: CTRI/2014/08/004901.",0.6933088898658752

Sixty-seven randomised placebo-controlled trials of dietary supplements containing isolated organic compounds for weight loss were included. Meta-analyses were conducted for chitosan, glucomannan, conjugated linoleic acid and fructans, comparing mean weight difference post-intervention between participants receiving the dietary supplement or placebo. Results: Statistically significant weight differences compared to placebo were observed for chitosan (-1.84 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.79, -0.88; p 0.01), glucomannan (-1.27 kg; 95%CI -2.45, -0.09; p = 0.04), and conjugated linoleic acid (-1.08 kg; 95%CI -1.61, -0.55; p 0.01).

Compelling evidence links overweight and obesity with serious disorders such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Dietary regimen are notoriously burdened with poor compliance. Chitosan is promoted in the US and other countries as an oral remedy to reduce fat absorption and has now been incorporated as a major constituent into several over-the-counter remedies. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the clinical effectiveness of oral chitosan for body weight reduction. Methods: Thirty-four overweight volunteers were included in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Subjects were assigned to receive either four capsules of chitosan or indistinguishable placebo twice daily for 28 consecutive days. Measurements were taken at baseline, after 14 and 28d of treatment. Subjects maintained their normal diet and documented the type and amount of food consumed. Adverse effects were assessed and compliance monitored. Results: Data from 30 subjects were entered into an intention-to-treat analysis. After four weeks of treatment, body mass index, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, vitamin A, D, E and beta-carotene were not significantly different in subjects receiving chitosan compared to those receiving placebo. Vitamin K was significantly increased after four weeks in the chitosan group compared with placebo (P 0.05). Compliance was 91.5% and 96.0% for chitosan and placebo groups respectively.

Selection criteria: Trials were included in the review if they were randomised controlled trials of chitosan for a minimum of four weeks duration in adults who were overweight or obese. Authors of included studies were contacted for additional information where appropriate. Data collection and analysis: Details from eligible trials were extracted independently by two reviewers using a standardised data extraction form. Differences in data extraction were resolved by consensus. Continuous data were expressed as weighted mean differences and standard deviations. The pooled effect size was computed by using the inverse variance weighted method. Main results: Fifteen trials including a total of 1219 participants met the inclusion criteria. No trial to date has measured the effect of chitosan on mortality or morbidity. Analyses indicated that chitosan preparations result in a significantly greater weight loss (weighted mean difference -1.7 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.1 to -1.3 kg, P 0.00001), decrease in total cholesterol (-0.2 mmol/L [95% CI -0.3 to -0.1], P 0.00001), and a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared with placebo. There were no clear differences between intervention and control groups in terms of frequency of adverse events or in faecal fat excretion. However, the quality of many studies was sub-optimal and analyses restricted to studies that met allocation concealment criteria, were larger, or of longer duration showed that such trials produced substantially smaller decreases in weight and total cholesterol. Authors' conclusions: There is some evidence that chitosan is more effective than placebo in the short-term treatment of overweight and obesity.

One hundred forty-four people were randomised to either the PCST group or the comparator group. In the first 8 weeks, the PCST group received online education and PCST, whereas the comparison group received online education only. From weeks 8 to 24, both groups visited a physiotherapist 5 times for home exercise prescription. Assessments were performed at baseline, 8, 24, and 52 weeks. Primary outcomes were hip pain on walking (11-point numerical rating scale) and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC]) at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes were other measures of pain, quality-of-life, global change, self-efficacy, pain coping, pain catastrophizing, depression, anxiety, stress, physical activity, and adverse events. Primary outcomes were completed by 137 (95%), 131 (91%), and 127 (88%) participants at 8, 24, and 52 weeks, respectively.

Results: The participants undergoing HE or SE experienced a greater pain reduction compared to participants who received ED, both after the treatment (group mean change for ED -0.91 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -1.15, -0.68], for HE -1.06 [95% CI -1.10, -1.01], and for SE -1.12 [95% CI -1.15, -1.08]) and at 12 months (group mean change for ED -0.58 [95% CI -0.87, -0.30], for HE -0.82 [95% CI -0.87, -0.76], and for SE -0.82 [95% CI -0.86, -0.77]). Patients with knee OA who underwent HE or SE improved more compared to patients with hip OA at both follow-ups. Conclusion: In primary care, HE and SE lead to similar reductions in pain intensity but are more effective than ED alone. In addition, people with knee OA benefit more from HE and SE than people with hip OA.",0.2292035073041916

Objective: This study investigated the effect of an 8-week home strengthening program for the hip abductor muscles on knee joint loading (measured by the external knee adduction moment during gait), strength (force-generating capacity), and function and pain in individuals with medial knee OA. Design: The study design was a nonequivalent, pretest-posttest, control group design. Setting: Testing was conducted in a motor performance laboratory. Patients: An a priori sample size calculation was performed. Forty participants with knee OA were matched for age and sex with a control group of participants without knee OA. Intervention: Participants with knee OA completed a home hip abductor strengthening program. Measurements: Three-dimensional gait analysis was performed to obtain peak knee adduction moments in the first 50% of the stance phase. Isokinetic concentric strength of the hip abductor muscles was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. The Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test was used to evaluate functional performance. Knee pain was assessed with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire. Results: Following the intervention, the OA group demonstrated significant improvement in hip abductor strength, but not in the knee adduction moment. Functional performance on the sit-to-stand test improved in the OA group compared with the control group. The OA group reported decreased knee pain after the intervention. Limitations: Gait strategies that may have affected the knee adduction moment, including lateral trunk lean, were not evaluated in this study. Conclusions: Hip abductor strengthening did not reduce knee joint loading but did improve function and reduce pain in a group with medial knee OA.",0.2210623174905777

Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Rehabilitation research center in Australia. Participants: Twenty-three patients with unilateral THR were randomly assigned to a supervised center-based exercise group (n=11) or an unsupervised home-based exercise group (n=12). Intervention: The center-based group completed an 8-week targeted exercise program while under the direct supervision of a physiotherapist. After initial instruction, the home-based group completed the 8-week targeted exercise program at home without further supervision. Main outcome measures: Quality of life, physical function, and spatiotemporal measures of gait. Results: No significant interaction (group by time) or main effects of grouping were found. Within each group, quality of life, and stair climbing improved significantly (P .05) as did Timed Up &amp; Go test and 6-minute walk test performances (P .05). Walking speed increased by 16 cm/s (P .01), cadence by 8 steps/min (P .05), step length by 4.7 cm (P .05), and double-support time reduced by a factor of 16%. Step length symmetry showed significant improvement (P .05) over time. Step length differential between the affected and unaffected limbs reduced from 4.0 to 2.7 cm. Conclusions: The targeted strengthening program was effective for both the home- and center-based groups. No group differences were found in the majority of the outcome measures. This finding is important because it shows that THR patients can achieve significant improvements through a targeted strengthening program delivered at a center or at home.",0.3382207453250885

Design: Single-Blinded Randomized Clinical Trial. Setting: Patients with KOA. Participants: Male and female subjects were recruited from patients referred to the University of Calgary Sport Medicine Center and from newspaper advertisements. Interventions: Thirty-seven and 35 patients with KOA were randomly assigned to either a 12-week hip or leg strengthening exercise program, respectively. Both exercise programs consisted of strengthening and flexibility exercises, which were completed 3 to 5 days a week. The first 3 weeks of exercise were supervised and the remaining 9 weeks consisted of at-home exercise. Main outcome measures: Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS) and Western Ontario McMaster Arthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaires, 6-minute walk test, hip and knee range of motion (ROM), and hip and leg muscle strength. Results: Statistically and clinically significant improvements in the KOOS and WOMAC pain subscale scores were observed in both the hip and leg strengthening programs. There was no statistical difference in the change in scores observed between the 2 groups. Equal improvements in the KOOS and WOMAC function and QOL subscales were observed for both programs. There was no change in hip and knee ROM or hip and leg strength in either group. Conclusions: Isolated hip and leg strengthening exercise programs seem to similarly improve knee pain, function, and QOL in patients with KOA. Clinical relevance: The results of this study show that both hip and leg strengthening exercises improve pain and QOL in patients with KOA and should be incorporated into the exercise prescription of patients with KOA.",0.24690911173820496

Design: Single-blind randomized controlled trial. Setting: Home-based exercise programmes. Subjects: A total of 46 women with hip osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to the high-velocity (n = 23) or low-velocity (n = 23) training group. Interventions: Both groups underwent an eight-week daily home-based resistance training programme using an elastic band. Exercises involved hip abduction, extension, and flexion and knee extension. Participants in the high-velocity group performed the concentric phase of each repetition as rapidly as possible and returned to the initial position eccentrically in 3 s. Participants in the low-velocity group performed both the concentric and eccentric phases in 3 s. Main measures: The following outcome measures were evaluated: isometric muscle strength, muscle power, muscle thickness, muscle echo intensity, maximum walking speed, Timed Up and Go test, 3-minute walking test, Harris Hip Score, and hip pain. Results: Decreases in the time for performing the Timed Up and Go test (mean changes: high-velocity group -0.46 s, low-velocity group -0.23 s) and echo intensity of the gluteus maximus (mean changes: high-velocity group -6.8, low-velocity group -1.0) were significantly greater in the high-velocity group than in the low-velocity group.

Few validated technological solutions exist to ensure supervision of users while they exercise at home. Motion Coach (Kaia Health GmbH) provides audiovisual feedback on exercise execution in real time on conventional smartphones. Objective: We hypothesized that the interrater agreement between physiotherapists and Motion Coach would be noninferior to physiotherapists' interrater agreement for exercise evaluations in a cohort with osteoarthritis. Methods: Patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip were recruited at a university hospital to perform a set of 6 exercises. Agreement between Motion Coach and 2 physiotherapists' corrections for segments of the exercises were compared using Cohen κ and percent agreement. Results: Participants (n=24) were enrolled and evaluated. There were no significant differences between interrater agreements (Motion Coach app vs physiotherapists: percent agreement 0.828; physiotherapist 1 vs physiotherapist 2: percent agreement 0.833; P .001). Age (70 years or under, older than 70 years), gender (male, female), or BMI (30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or under, greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) subgroup analysis revealed no detectable difference in interrater agreement. There was no detectable difference in levels of interrater agreement between Motion Coach vs physiotherapists and between physiotherapists in any of the 6 exercises. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that Motion Coach is noninferior to physiotherapist evaluations. Interrater agreement did not differ between 2 physiotherapists or between physiotherapists and the Motion Coach app. This finding was valid for all investigated exercises and subgroups.

About 50% of infertility cases have been known to be associated with the male partner . Oxidative stress (OS) represents an imbalance in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and anti-oxidants. In fact, OS has been considered as one of the popular pathologies reported in about 50% of all infertile males. Therefore, the increased level of ROS may result in infertility via DNA damages or lipid peroxidation (LPO) as well as the inactivation of enzymes and oxidation of protiens in spermatozoa. Basically, OS results from lifestyle variables. As the absence of antioxidants and the respective deficiencies in the semen cause OS, variations in the lifestyle and anti-oxidant regimes may be advantageous to treatment strategies for resolving such an issue. Actually, anti-oxidants like vitamins E and C, glutathione, coenzyme-Q10, carnitines, selenium, Nacetylcysteine, carotenoids, zinc, and pentoxifylline decline the OS-induced sperm damages. Therefore, the present review overviews the oxidative biochemistry associated with sperm health and identifies which men would be most at risk of oxidative infertility. Hence, the review would show the techniques provided to diagnose OS and diverse therapeutic options.",0.7662242650985718

Although origins of idiopathic infertility are still unclear, factors, such as an altered oxidative balance, are believed to be involved. Melatonin is an outstanding antioxidant reportedly present in the follicular fluid (FF), which has been suggested as a useful tool in the management of human fertility. Herein, we observed that intrafollicular concentrations of melatonin were blunted in women with unexplained infertility (UI), which was associated with a marked oxidative imbalance in UI patients' FF. Based on these findings, this randomized pilot study was aimed at assessing whether exogenous melatonin ameliorated oxidative stress and improved in vitro fertilization (IVF) success rates in UI. Thus, 3 mg/day or 6 mg/day of melatonin were given to UI patients for a period spanning from the first appointment to control ovarian stimulation until the day of follicular puncture. Our results indicate that melatonin supplementation, irrespective of the two doses tested, ameliorated intrafollicular oxidative balance and oocyte quality in UI patients, and that this translated into a slight increase in the rate of pregnancies/live births. Therefore, although the indoleamine has shown therapeutic potential in this clinical setting, larger clinical trials in populations with different backgrounds are encouraged to corroborate the usefulness of melatonin.",0.9858691692352295

There is limited evidence about the influence of nutrition on quality of semen. Approximately, 30-80% of infertility cases are caused by oxidative stress and decreased level of seminal total antioxidant capacity. This study was aimed to review the effects of oral antioxidant supplements on improving major semen parameters such as sperm concentration, motility, morphology, DNA damage, and fertility rate. Data were extracted from PubMed and Google scholar database by using the terms ""antioxidant"", ""multivitamin"", ""carnitine"", ""CoQ10"", ""vitamin C"", ""vitamin E"", ""zinc"", ""folic acid"", ""N-acetyl cysteine"" and ""selenium"" combined with ""male infertility"", ""semen"", and ""sperm"" to generate a set of relevant citations. Supplements such as CoQ10 and alpha-tocopherol significantly improve sperm count. Also, carnitine has positive effects on sperm motility and morphology. Simultaneous administration of vitamin E and vitamin C reduces the sperm DNA damage. However, in some studies, one or more factors have not changed substantially. In most of the studies, antioxidant supplementation improved the number, motility, morphology and sometimes DNA integrity of sperm.

However, given their over-the-counter availability at unnaturally high concentrations and also the fact that they are commonly added to various food products, patients may run a risk of consuming excessive dosages of these compounds, which may then be toxic. The few studies that have assessed antioxidant overuse and the associated adverse effects found that large doses of dietary antioxidant supplements have varying-if any-therapeutic effects even though free radicals clearly damage cells-a phenomenon that has been termed the ""antioxidant paradox."" Furthermore, overuse of antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, N-acetyl cysteine may lead to reductive stress, which is reported to be as dangerous to cells as oxidative stress and can be the cause of diseases such as cancer or cardiomyopathy.

150,2021,32851663,Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,antioxidant supplements fertility,0.0,"Background: A couple may be considered to have fertility problems if they have been trying to conceive for over a year with no success. This may affect up to a quarter of all couples planning a child. It is estimated that for 40% to 50% of couples, subfertility may result from factors affecting women. Antioxidants are thought to reduce the oxidative stress brought on by these conditions. Currently, limited evidence suggests that antioxidants improve fertility, and trials have explored this area with varied results. This review assesses the evidence for the effectiveness of different antioxidants in female subfertility. Objectives: To determine whether supplementary oral antioxidants compared with placebo, no treatment/standard treatment or another antioxidant improve fertility outcomes for subfertile women. Search methods: We searched the following databases (from their inception to September 2019), with no language or date restriction: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGFG) specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and AMED. We checked reference lists of relevant studies and searched the trial registers. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any type, dose or combination of oral antioxidant supplement with placebo, no treatment or treatment with another antioxidant, among women attending a reproductive clinic. We excluded trials comparing antioxidants with fertility drugs alone and trials that only included fertile women attending a fertility clinic because of male partner infertility. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary review outcome was live birth; secondary outcomes included clinical pregnancy rates and adverse events. Main results: We included 63 trials involving 7760 women. Investigators compared oral antioxidants, including: combinations of antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine, melatonin, L-arginine, myo-inositol, carnitine, selenium, vitamin E, vitamin B complex, vitamin C, vitamin D+calcium, CoQ10, and omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids versus placebo, no treatment/standard treatment or another antioxidant. Only 27 of the 63 included trials reported funding sources. Due to the very low-quality of the evidence we are uncertain whether antioxidants improve live birth rate compared with placebo or no treatment/standard treatment (odds ratio (OR) 1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.43; P 0.001, I<sup>2</sup> = 29%; 13 RCTs, 1227 women). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected live birth rate of 19%, the rate among women using antioxidants would be between 24% and 36%. Low-quality evidence suggests that antioxidants may improve clinical pregnancy rate compared with placebo or no treatment/standard treatment (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.43 to 1.89; P 0.001, I<sup>2</sup> = 63%; 35 RCTs, 5165 women). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected clinical pregnancy rate of 19%, the rate among women using antioxidants would be between 25% and 30%. Heterogeneity was moderately high. Overall 28 trials reported on various adverse events in the meta-analysis. The evidence suggests that the use of antioxidants makes no difference between the groups in rates of miscarriage (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.55; P = 0.46, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 24 RCTs, 3229 women; low-quality evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of multiple pregnancy (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.56; P = 0.99, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 9 RCTs, 1886 women; low-quality evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of gastrointestinal disturbances (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.47 to 5.10; P = 0.47, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 3 RCTs, 343 women; low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence showed that there was also no difference between the groups in rates of ectopic pregnancy (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.27 to 7.20; P = 0.69, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 4 RCTs, 404 women). In the antioxidant versus antioxidant comparison, low-quality evidence shows no difference in a lower dose of melatonin being associated with an increased live-birth rate compared with higher-dose melatonin (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.15; P = 0.89, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 RCTs, 140 women). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected live-birth rate of 24%, the rate among women using a lower dose of melatonin compared to a higher dose would be between 12% and 40%. Similarly with clinical pregnancy, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates between a lower and a higher dose of melatonin (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.15; P = 0.89, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 RCTs, 140 women). Three trials reported on miscarriage in the antioxidant versus antioxidant comparison (two used doses of melatonin and one compared N-acetylcysteine versus L-carnitine). There were no miscarriages in either melatonin trial. Multiple pregnancy and gastrointestinal disturbances were not reported, and ectopic pregnancy was reported by only one trial, with no events. The study comparing N-acetylcysteine with L-carnitine did not report live birth rate. Very low-quality evidence shows no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.00; 1 RCT, 164 women; low-quality evidence). Low quality evidence shows no difference in miscarriage (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.67; 1 RCT, 164 women; low-quality evidence). The study did not report multiple pregnancy, gastrointestinal disturbances or ectopic pregnancy. The overall quality of evidence was limited by serious risk of bias associated with poor reporting of methods, imprecision and inconsistency. Authors' conclusions: In this review, there was low- to very low-quality evidence to show that taking an antioxidant may benefit subfertile women. Overall, there is no evidence of increased risk of miscarriage, multiple births, gastrointestinal effects or ectopic pregnancies, but evidence was of very low quality. At this time, there is limited evidence in support of supplemental oral antioxidants for subfertile women.",0.16207513213157654

How this toxicity affects the spermatozoan in its interactions with the ovum is still unknown. An increase in oxidative damage to sperm membranes, proteins, and DNA is associated with alterations in signal transduction mechanisms that affect fertility. Recent evidence suggests that spermatozoa and oocytes possess an inherent but limited capacity to generate ROS to aid in the fertilization process. Though a variety of defense mechanisms encompassing antioxidant enzymes (SOD, catalase, and GSH peroxidase and reductase), vitamins (E, C, and carotenoids), and biomolecules (GSH and ubiquinol) are available, a balance of the benefits and risks from ROS and antioxidants appears to be necessary for the survival and functioning of spermatozoa. An assay system for the evaluation of OSS needs to be developed. Such an assay will assist the clinician in the assessment of fertility status of both male and female partners. The determination of this OSS value will also theoretically identify the subgroups of responders and nonresponders to any putative antioxidant therapy. Though the therapeutic use of antioxidants appears attractive, clinicians need to be aware of exaggerated claims of antioxidant benefits by various commercial supplements for fertility purposes until proper multicenter clinical trial have been completed.",0.19025062024593353

(Papaveraceae) (greater celandine) is a medicinal herb that is widely spread in Europe. Antitumoural activity has been reported for C. majus extracts. Hypothesis/purpose: To investigate the antitumour activity of a C. majus extract in vitro and in vivo. Study design: Cytotoxic effects of C. majus extracts were evaluated on human cancer cell lines, i.e. PANC-1 (pancreas cancer), HT-29 (colon cancer), MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer), PC-EM005 and PC-EM002 (primary endometrium cancer cells), and PANC02 (murine pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells). A preliminary in vivo study was performed to evaluate the effect of a defatted C. majus extract and Ukrain(TM) in a highly metastatic murine pancreatic model. Methods: Chelidonium majus L. herb containing 1.26% (dry weight) of total alkaloids expressed as chelidonine was used to prepare an 80% ethanolic extract (CM2). This crude extract was then defatted with n-hexane, resulting in a defatted C. majus extract (CM2B). Cytotoxic effects of the two extracts (CM2 and CM2B) were evaluated on human and murine cell lines in vitro. CM2B and Ukrain(TM) were evaluated in a highly metastatic murine pancreatic model. Results: Four main benzylisoquinoline alkaloids were identified in CM2B, i.e. chelidonine, sanguinarine, chelerythrine and protopine, using HPLC-UV. CM2 showed a high cytotoxic activity against PANC-1 (IC50, 20.7 µg/ml) and HT-29 (IC50, 20.6 µg/ml), and a moderate cytotoxic activity against MDA-MB-231 (IC50, 73.9 µg/ml).

The specific capacity of each alkaloid to penetrate into the cells was estimated by monitoring alkaloid concentration decreases in the cell medium during incubation with murine fibroblast NIH/3T3, mouse melanoma B16F10, and human breast cancer MCF7 cell lines. Mixtures of isoquinoline alkaloids containing protopine, chelidonine, sanguinarine, allocryptopine, and stylopine were applied to cell cultures for 20 and 40 min, and the content of alkaloids in the cell media was measured by capillary electrophoresis (CE). CE separation of isoquinoline alkaloids was performed in 30 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.5). As these alkaloids have native fluorescence, they were directly detected using the commercially available UV light-emitting diode without troublesome fluorescent derivatization. The results showed a differential ability of celandine alkaloids to penetrate into the normal and cancer cell interior, which was inversely proportional to their cytotoxic activity. While the most effective transport of celandine alkaloids from the cell medium to the cell interior was observed for normal murine fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells (about 55% of total content), cytotoxicity tests demonstrated selective and profound apoptotic effects of a five-alkaloid combination in the mouse melanoma B16F10 cell line.",0.40877318382263184

Chelidonine suppressed the growth of all tested HNSCC cell lines, including a paclitaxel-resistant and P-glycoprotein ( MDR1 ) overexpressing cell line, but not in a clear dose-dependent manner. Mucosal keratinocytes were also strongly affected by chelidonine, while fibroblasts proved to be much more resistant. Chelidonine failed to trigger apoptosis at physiological concentrations in HNSCC cell lines. Based on a spheroid invasion model chelidonine suppressed invasion of FaDu cells effectively on gelatin, fibronectin, collagen I, laminin and Matrigel<sup>®</sup>. However, invasion inhibition of the more aggressively invading cell line HLaC78 largely failed. Using the tube formation assay, chelidonine effectively inhibited angiogenesis.

Methods: The potential antioxidant activity of CME was proved by the 1,1-diphenyl- 2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. The cytotoxicity of CME was measured by the cell growth inhibition assay using murine leukemia L1210 cell line and human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells. Apoptosis-inducing effect was determined by fluorescence microscopy (chromatin condensation and nuclear DNA fragmentation). Results: In the DPPH assay CME acted as a scavenger of DPPH free radical. The results on antiproliferative properties assessment clearly demonstrated that CME had a cytotoxic effect towards both leukemia cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the human promyelocytic HL-60 cells were more sensitive to CME treatment than the L1210 cells. Conclusions: We concluded that the extract of C. majus L. had a strong antioxidant potential and exerted the antiproliferative activity via apoptosis on leukemia cells.

Since antineoplasic agents induce NF-kappaB and their effects are regulated by this transcription factor, we investigated its possible participation in the apoptotic effects of Ukrain. Ukrain induced apoptosis in a panel of cancer cell lines by activating the intrinsic cell death pathway, as demonstrated by the cleavage of caspase 9 and the upregulation and cleavage of caspase 3. The effect was reversible, since long exposures (24 hours or more) were needed, as verified by clonogenic assays. Gene reporter assays showed that Ukrain activated NF-kappa B. Nevertheless, this activation was not required for, and did not modulate, the Ukrain effect: neither blockage of activation by a dominant negative version of Ikappa-B alpha or a Bcl-3 siRNA, nor activation of the pathway by overexpression of IKK2, changed the response to the drug.

Lung cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are pivotal in lung cancer metastasis and drug resistance. This study aimed to develop lung CSCs that stably express stem cell properties through transfection to further screen traditional Chinese herbal compounds. Lung adenocarcinoma stem cells, which include various phenotypic subgroups, are normally characterized by high expression levels of pluripotent stem cell genes, particularly Nanog and OCT4. Plasmids containing Nanog and OCT4 were constructed and transfected into cells, and lung CSCs were identified not only in vitro using RT-PCR, Western blotting, plate cloning, sphere formation, drug resistance, and transwell migration but also in vivo using a nude mouse tumorigenicity assay. Subsequently, sanguinarine, which is derived from the whole leaves of the traditional Chinese medicine celandine, was identified through the high-throughput screening of a small-molecule compound library. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms of the effects of sanguinarine revealed that it significantly inhibited lung CSC proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis, possibly via downregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our results indicate that lung CSCs established by gene transfection may provide a stable and effective method of constructing CSCs to effectively screen potential antitumor drugs.

To investigate this, 104 histologically confirmed NPC cases and 205 matched controls were studied in The Philippines. Blood was collected to assess antibody titers against EBV, and an interview was administered which elicited information concerning herbal medicine use and other risk factors for NPC. Subjects strongly positive for anti-EBV antibodies (Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen [EBNA]) (titers greater than or equal to 1:80) were at a 21-fold excess risk of disease (95% confidence interval, 8.4, 51.8). Herbal medicine use was also associated with NPC (relative risk, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4, 4.5). Associations persisted after adjustment for education, smoking, Chinese ancestry, and consumption of salted fish. Exposure to herbal medicines among subjects testing negative/weakly positive for anti-EBNA antibodies was not associated with an elevation in risk (relative risk, 0.6), strong positivity to anti-EBNA antibodies in the absence of herbal medicine use was associated with a significant 16-fold excess risk of disease, and exposure to herbal medicines among subjects testing strongly positive for anti-EBNA antibodies was associated with a significant 49-fold excess risk of NPC when cases were compared to controls. Similar results were obtained when other serological measures of EBV exposure were used. Anti-EBV antibody titers were elevated in herbal medicine users compared to nonusers among cases but not among control subjects. This suggests that, if herbal medicines interact with EBV in the development of NPC, they do not do so by reactivating EBV infection but rather through a direct proliferative effect on EBV-transformed cells. Although the interaction between EBV and herbal medicines is biologically plausible, larger, more detailed studies need to be conducted to validate this preliminary finding.",0.09342744201421738

Objectives: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of milk thistle or milk thistle constituents versus placebo or no intervention in patients with alcoholic liver disease and/or viral liver diseases (hepatitis B and hepatitis C). Search strategy: The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and full text searches were combined (July 2007). Manufacturers and researchers in the field were contacted. Selection criteria: Only randomised clinical trials in patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases (acute and chronic) were included. Interventions encompassed milk thistle at any dose or duration versus placebo or no intervention. The trials could be double blind, single blind, or unblinded. The trials could be unpublished or published and no language limitations were applied. Data collection and analysis: The primary outcome measure was mortality. Binary outcomes are reported as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses were performed with regard to methodological quality. Main results: Eighteen randomised clinical trials assessed milk thistle in 1088 patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases. The methodological quality was low: only 28.6% of the trials reported high methodological quality characteristics. Milk thistle versus placebo or no intervention had no significant effect on mortality (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15), complications of liver disease (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09), or liver histology.

Because standard of care with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy is costly, has significant side effects, and fails to cure about half of all infections, many patients seek complementary and alternative medicine to improve their health, such as Silymarin, derived from milk thistle (Silybum marianum). Milk thistle's clinical benefits for chronic hepatitis C are unsettled due to variability in standardization of the herbal product. Methods: In the current study, we focused on the anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties of a standardized Silymarin extract (MK-001). Results: MK-001 inhibited expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in anti-CD3 stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and nuclear factor kappa B-dependent transcription in human hepatoma Huh7 cells. Moreover, MK-001 dose dependently inhibited infection of Huh7 and Huh7.5.1 cells by JFH-1 virus. MK-001 displayed both prophylactic and therapeutic effects against HCV infection, and when combined with interferon-alpha, inhibited HCV replication more than interferon-alpha alone. Commercial preparations of Silymarin also displayed antiviral activity, although the effects were not as potent as MK-001. Antiviral effects of the extract were attributable in part to induction of Stat1 phosphorylation, while interferon-independent mechanisms were suggested when the extract was biochemically fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Silybin A, silybin B, and isosilybin A, isosilybin B elicited the strongest anti-NF-kappaB and anti-HCV actions. These effects were independent of MK-001-induced cytotoxicity.

There is no reliable and effective therapy for chronic hepatitis C since interferon and antivirals work no more than 30% of the time, and liver transplant surgery is uncertain and tentative over the long run. This is because, ultimately, residual hepatitis C viremia infects the new liver. Furthermore, liver transplantation can be painful, disabling and extremely costly. Treatment program: The author describes a low cost and efficacious treatment program in 3 patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and esophageal varices secondary to chronic hepatitis C infection. This effective and conservative regimen combines 3 potent antioxidants (alpha-lipoic acid [thioctic acid], silymarin, and selenium) that possess antiviral, free radical quenching and immune boosting qualities. Conclusion: There are no remarkably effective treatments for chronic hepatitis C in general use. Interferon and antivirals have less than a 30% response rate and because of the residual viremia, a newly transplanted liver usually becomes infected again. The triple antioxidant combination of alpha-lipoic acid, silymarin and selenium was chosen for a conservative treatment of hepatitis C because these substances protect the liver from free radical damage, increase the levels of other fundamental antioxidants, and interfere with viral proliferation. The 3 patients presented in this paper followed the triple antioxidant program and recovered quickly and their laboratory values remarkably improved. Furthermore, liver transplantation was avoided and the patients are back at work, carrying out their normal activities, and feeling healthy. The author offers a more conservative approach to the treatment of hepatitis C, that is exceedingly less expensive. One year of the triple antioxidant therapy described in this paper costs less than $2,000, as compared to mor than $300,000 a year for liver transplant surgery. It appears reasonable, that prior to liver transplant surgery evaluation, or during the transplant evaluation process, the conservative triple antioxidant treatment approach should be considered.

Milk thistle extract, known as silymarin, is a complex mixture of seven major flavonolignans and one flavonoid. The phytoconstituents of silymarin owe their therapeutic and hepatoprotective effects to their strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Primary liver cancer, also known as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), occurs in a milieu of oxidative stress and inflammation. The etiology of HCC includes chronic infection with hepatitis B and C viruses, cirrhosis, and exposure to dietary and environmental hepatocarcinogens. Current therapeutic options for HCC, including surgical resection and liver transplantation, have limited benefits and are essentially ineffective. Chemoprevention, using phytochemicals with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, represents a fascinating strategy, which has been a subject of intense investigation in the recent years. In this review, we explore the potential role of silymarin as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent for HCC. The review systematically evaluates the preclinical in-vitro and in-vivo studies investigating the effects of silymarin and its constituents on HCC.

Methods: The effects of 4 different concentrations of catechins and theaflavins were evaluated on 5 isolates each of 5 Candida species employing an agar diffusion growth inhibition assay. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the polyphenols against C. albicans was determined. The post-antifungal effect (PAFE) of the polyphenols for C. albicans was investigated. C. albicans cells exposed to polyphenols were studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results: Both polyphenols showed anti-Candida activity against all tested Candida species and demonstrated a MIC of 6.25 mg/ml for C. albicans. C. glabrata was found to be the most sensitive species followed by C. parapsilosis, C. albicans, C. krusei and C. tropicalis (p 0.05 for all). Significant intraspecies variations in sensitivity were noted among C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis (p 0.001) for both polyphenols.

We aimed to ascertain the beneficial effects of ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) on rat pups exposed to hyperoxia and inflammation. Materials and methods: Thirty-six newborn Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups as the hyperoxia (95% O 2 ) + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group, the hyperoxia + LPS + ginger-treated group, and the control/no treatment group (21% O 2 ). Pups in the hyperoxia + LPS + ginger group were administered oral ginger at a dose of 1000 mg/kg daily during the study period. Histopathologic, immunochemical (SMA and lamellar body), and biochemical evaluations including total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and caspase-3 activities were performed. Results: Better weight gain and survival rates were shown in the hyperoxia + LPS + ginger group (P 0.05). In the histopathologic and immunochemical evaluation, severity of lung damage was significantly reduced in the hyperoxia + LPS + ginger group, as well as decreased apoptosis (ELISA for caspase-3) (P 0.05). Tissue TAS levels were significantly protected, and TOS, MDA, and MPO levels were significantly lower in the hyperoxia + LPS + ginger group (P 0.05). Tissue TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly decreased in the ginger-treated group (P 0.05). Conclusion: Ginger efficiently reduced the lung damage and protected the lungs from severe damage due to hyperoxia and inflammation. Therefore, ginger may be an alternative option for the treatment of BPD.",0.4383822977542877

Objective: This study assessed urinary oxalate excretion from supplemental doses of cinnamon and turmeric as well as changes in fasting plasma glucose, cholesterol, and triacylglycerol concentrations. Design: Eleven healthy subjects, aged 21-38 y, participated in an 8-wk, randomly assigned, crossover study that involved the ingestion of supplemental doses of cinnamon and turmeric for 4-wk periods that provided 55 mg oxalate/d. Oxalate load tests, which entailed the ingestion of a 63-mg dose of oxalate from the test spices, were performed after each 4-wk experimental period and at the study onset with water only (control treatment). Fasting plasma glucose and lipid concentrations were also assessed at these time points. Results: Compared with the cinnamon and control treatments, turmeric ingestion led to a significantly higher urinary oxalate excretion during the oxalate load tests. There were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose or lipids in conjunction with the 4-wk periods of either cinnamon or turmeric supplementation. Conclusions: The percentage of oxalate that was water soluble differed markedly between cinnamon (6%) and turmeric (91%), which appeared to be the primary cause of the greater urinary oxalate excretion/oxalate absorption from turmeric. The consumption of supplemental doses of turmeric, but not cinnamon, can significantly increase urinary oxalate levels, thereby increasing risk of kidney stone formation in susceptible individuals.",0.1850164383649826

The objective of this study was to ascertain whether oral garlic reduced vaginal candida counts during the second half of the menstrual cycle in asymptomatic women colonised with Candida species. Design: A simple randomised double-blinded controlled trial. Setting: Melbourne, Australia. Sample: Sixty-three asymptomatic women who were culture-positive for Candida species at screening. Methods: Participants were randomised to three garlic tablets or placebo orally, twice daily, for 14 days. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of women with colony counts of candida &gt;100 colony-forming units per ml in any given day during the last 7 days before menstruation, defined as a 'case'. Secondary outcomes included the mean quantitative colony counts of candida over 14 days prior to menses. Results: There was no evidence of a difference between the proportion of cases in the garlic and placebo groups (76 versus 90%; relative risk, RR 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 0.67-1.08), in the mean colony counts in both groups (ratio of geometric means of candidal colony counts 0.63; 95% CI 0.39-10.03; P = 0.74), or difference in the number of women reporting abnormal vaginal symptoms during the 2 weeks before menstruation (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.67-1.58; P = 0.91).

Determination of in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for different C. albicans isolates revealed that both allicin and fluconazole showed different MICs that ranged from 0.05 to 12.5 μg mL(-1) and 0.25 to 16 μg mL(-1) , respectively. A time-kill study showed a significant effect of allicin (P 0.01) against C. albicans, comparable to that of fluconazole. Scanning electron microscopy observation revealed that, similar to fluconazole, allicin produced structural destruction of C. albicans cell surface at low MIC and lysis or puncture at high MIC concentrations. Treatment of BALB/c mice systemically infected with C. albicans showed that although the allicin treatment (at 5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) ) was slightly less efficacious than fluconazole treatment in terms of the fungal load reduction and host survival time, it was still effective against C. albicans in terms of mean survival time, which increased from 8.4 to 15.8 days. These results demonstrate the efficacy of anticandidal effects of allicin both in vitro and in an animal model of candidiasis and affirm the potential of allicin as an adjuvant therapy to fluconazole.",0.5515992641448975

Although such chemical burns typically are associated with misuse of analgesics, investigators also have reported them in conjunction with topical application of a variety of other agents. Case description: The authors report an unusual case of a 49-year-old man seeking care for maxillary tooth pain who had an oral mucosal burn of the maxillary vestibule caused by topical application of crushed raw garlic. The patient believed this treatment would alleviate his dental pain. Localized tissue necrosis was visible at the site of application. The authors instructed the patient to cease self-treatment with raw garlic but deemed treatment was otherwise unnecessary. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the second reported case of a garlic burn of the oral mucosa. The authors discuss the history of garlic as a naturopathic remedy, as well as the development of chemical burns associated with its topical use. The authors also review the literature on chemical burns caused by inappropriate self-treatment. Conclusions and practical implications: Dentists should consider the possibility of an oral chemical burn when a patient has a destructive or necrotic mucosal lesion located near a painful tooth. In this report, the authors highlight the importance of obtaining a detailed clinical history to establish a proper diagnosis and proper patient education to prevent future mucosal injury from inappropriate self-treatment.

Material and methods: The microdilution technique was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of apple cider vinegar containing 4% maleic acid, and nystatin (control). Further tests of microbial kinetics and inhibition of adherence to acrylic resin were performed testing different concentrations (MIC, MICx2, MICx4) of the products at time intervals of 0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes. A roughness meter was used to measure the changes in surface roughness; color change of the acrylic resin specimens exposed to the test products in different concentrations and time intervals were also evaluated. Results: Apple cider vinegar (4%) showed MIC of 2500 μg/ml and MFC of 2500, 5000, and 10,000 μg/ml depending on the strain tested. Nystatin showed MIC of 3.125 μg/ml and strain-dependent MFC values ranging from 3.125 to 12.5 μg/ml. The microbial kinetic assay showed a statistical difference between apple cider vinegar and nystatin (p 0.0001). After 30 minutes of exposure, apple cider vinegar showed fungicidal effect at MICx4, whereas nystatin maintained its fungistatic effect. Apple cider vinegar showed greater inhibition of adherence (p 0.001) compared to control. Apple cider vinegar did not significantly alter the surface roughness of the acrylic resin specimens compared to nystatin (p &gt; 0.05), and both had no influence on their color. Conclusion: Apple cider vinegar showed antifungal properties against Candida spp., thus representing a possible therapeutic alternative for patients with denture stomatitis.",0.3400747776031494

A search was conducted of all published literature on conventional search engines (PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Registry, CINAHL, LILACS) and alternative medicine databases (Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, Longwood Herbal Taskforce, and Alternative Medicine Alert), for all studies of the five most commonly used CAM treatments of vaginitis. Inconsistencies in definition of vaginitis, type of intervention, control groups, and outcomes prevented performance of a meta-analysis, and paucity of high-quality studies made ranking by evidence-based scales unsuitable. Lactobacillus recolonization (via yogurt or capsules) shows promise for the treatment of both yeast vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis with little potential for harm. Boric acid can be recommended to women with recurrent vulvovaginal Candidal infections who are resistant to conventional therapies, but can occasionally cause vaginal burning. Because of associated risks in the absence of well-documented clinical benefits, douching remains a practice that should not be recommended for the treatment of vaginitis. Finally, tea tree oil and garlic show some in vitro potential for the treatment of vaginitis, but the lack of in vivo studies preclude their recommendation to patients for the time-being. The available evidence for CAM treatments of vaginitis is of poor quality despite the prevalent use of these therapies. Well-designed randomized, controlled trials investigating the efficacy and safety of these therapies for vaginitis are needed before any reliable clinical recommendations can be made. Target audience: Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists, Family Physicians.

It is expensive and unacceptable for many women who therefore have incorporated complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) into their personal care plan. Objective: To ascertain clinicians' knowledge of CAM and their recommendations for the use of CAM and non-pharmacological management in women with RVVC. Design and setting: Anonymous, single page, self completed survey using convenience sampling at a vulval disorders meeting in New South Wales, Australia in 2009. Participants: Sixty six health professionals (medical practitioners, dermatologists, nurses and allied health professionals). Results: Most clinicians reported asking about their patients' use of CAM and non-pharmacological management of RVVC, although only around half reported recommending it. CAM management included lactobacillus, oral and vaginal yoghurt, vinegar, garlic, Chinese medicine and tea-tree oil. Non-pharmacological management included dietary changes and use of cotton undergarments. Lactobacillus was the most commonly recommended CAM. Conclusion: CAM is popular with patients and many clinicians actively recommend its use in RVVC despite limited supporting evidence.

Previously, we have confirmed that AVE treatment significantly reduces the viral replication of green fluorescent protein-labeled influenza A virus in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. In addition, post-treatment with AVE inhibited viral matrix protein 1 (M1), matrix protein 2 (M2), and hemagglutinin (HA) mRNA synthesis and viral protein (M1, M2, and HA) expressions. In this study, we demonstrated that AVE inhibited autophagy induced by influenza A virus in MDCK cells and also identified quercetin, catechin hydrate, and kaempferol as the active antiviral components of AVE. We also found that post-treatment with quercetin, catechin hydrate, and kaempferol markedly inhibited M2 viral mRNA synthesis and M2 protein expression. A docking simulation suggested that the binding affinity of quercetin, catechin hydrate, and kaempferol for the M2 protein may be higher than that of known M2 protein inhibitors. Thus, the inhibition of autophagy induced by influenza virus may explain the antiviral activity of AVE against H1N1 or H3N2.

The safety of PVP-I topically applied to the nasal and oral cavity is addressed by a literature review. The specific efficacy of PVP-I against coronaviruses and its potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is discussed. Methods: A review was performed utilizing PubMed and Cochrane Databases. All citations in protocols for nasal and oral PVP-I use regarding COVID-19 were independently reviewed. Results: Povidone-iodine has been safely administered for up to 5 months in the nasal cavity and 6 months in the oral cavity. Concentrations less than 2.5% in vitro do not reduce ciliary beat frequency or cause pathological changes in ciliated nasal epithelium, upper respiratory, or mucosal cells. Adverse events with oral use have not been reported in conscious adults or children. Allergy and contact sensitivity is rare. Chronic mucosal use up to 5% has not been shown to result in clinical thyroid disease. PVP-I is rapidly virucidal and inactivates coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Conclusions: Povidone-iodine can safely be used in the nose at concentrations up to 1.25% and in the mouth at concentrations up to 2.5% for up to 5 months.

Material and method: Twenty healthy volunteers participated in the experiments. The present study assessed autonomic parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and skin temperature to determine the arousal level of the autonomic nervous system. In addition, subjects were asked to estimate their mood responses such as feeling pleasant or unpleasant, uncomfortable, sensuality, relaxation, or refreshing in order to assess subjective behavioral arousal. Finally, electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 31 electrodes on the scalp according to the international 10 to 20 system, and EEG power spectra were calculated by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Data was analyzed by comparing the effects of lavender oil on physiological and mood states with sweet almond oil. These assessments were measured before and after using paired t-test statistical procedure. Results: The results revealed that lavender oil caused significant decreases of blood pressure, heart rate, and skin temperature, which indicated a decrease of autonomic arousal. In terms of mood responses, the subjects in the lavender oil group categorized themselves as more active, fresher relaxed than subjects just inhaling base oil. Compared with base oil, lavender oil increased the power of theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) brain activities.

206,misbelief,15669879,Does aloe help for a runny nose?,aloe help runny nose,0.0,"Antihistamines are useful medications for the treatment of a variety of allergic disorders. Second-generation antihistamines avidly and selectively bind to peripheral histamine H1 receptors and, consequently, provide gratifying relief of histamine-mediated symptoms in a majority of atopic patients. This tight receptor specificity additionally leads to few effects on other neuronal or hormonal systems, with the result that adverse effects associated with these medications, with the exception of noticeable sedation in about 10% of cetirizine-treated patients, resemble those of placebo overall. Similarly, serious adverse drug reactions and interactions are uncommon with these medicines. Therapeutic interchange to one of the available second-generation antihistamines is a reasonable approach to limiting an institutional formulary, and adoption of such a policy has proven capable of creating substantial cost savings. Differences in overall efficacy and safety between available second-generation antihistamines, when administered in equivalent dosages, are not large. However, among the antihistamines presently available, fexofenadine may offer the best overall balance of effectiveness and safety, and this agent is an appropriate selection for initial or switch therapy for most patients with mild or moderate allergic symptoms. Cetirizine is the most potent antihistamine available and has been subjected to more clinical study than any other.

206,misbelief,30020687,Does aloe help for a runny nose?,aloe help runny nose,0.0,"Hypersensitivity reactions (HR) are immune responses that are exaggerated or inappropriate against an antigen or allergen. Coombs and Gell classified hypersensitivity reactions into four forms. Type I, type II, and type III hypersensitivity reactions are known as immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IHR) because they occur within 24 hours. Antibodies including IgE, IgM, and IgG mediate them. Type I or Anaphylactic Response The anaphylactic response is mediated by IgE antibodies that are produced by the immune system in response to environmental proteins (allergens) such as pollens, animal danders, or dust mites. These antibodies (IgE) bind to mast cells and basophils, which contain histamine granules that are released in the reaction and cause inflammation. Type I hypersensitivity reactions can be seen in bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic dermatitis, food allergy, allergic conjunctivitis, and anaphylactic shock. Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency as it can lead to acute, life-threatening respiratory failure. It is an IgE-mediated process. It is the most severe form of an allergic reaction, where mast cells suddenly release a large amount of histamine and later on leukotrienes. In severe cases intense bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, cyanosis, hypotension, and shock are present. Allergic Bronchial Asthma Allergic bronchial asthma is an atopic disease, characterized by bronchospasm. It may also be a chronic inflammatory disease. In its etiology, environmental factors along with a genetic background play an important role. The diagnosis is dependent on history and examination. In allergic bronchial asthma, IgE is elevated, and sputum eosinophilia is common. Epidemiologically, a positive skin prick test or specific IgE are risk factors for asthma. Allergic Rhinitis Allergic rhinitis is another atopic disease where histamine and leukotrienes are responsible for rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal obstruction. Allergens are similar to those found in bronchial asthma. Nasal polyps may be seen in chronic rhinitis. Allergic Conjunctivitis Allergic conjunctivitis presents with rhinitis and is IgE-mediated. Itching and eye problems including watering, redness, and swelling always occur. Food Allergy Clinicians must differentiate food allergy (IgE-mediated) from food intolerance that can be a cause for a variety of etiologies including malabsorption and celiac disease. It is more frequent in children as seen in cow's milk allergy. Food allergy symptoms mostly affect the respiratory tract, the skin, and the gut. Skin prick tests are helpful to test for food allergens that can trigger severe reactions, e.g., peanuts, eggs, fish, and milk. Atopic Eczema Atopic eczema is an IgE-mediated disease that affects the skin and has an immunopathogenesis very similar to that of allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis, which are present in more than half of these patients. Radioallergosorbent (RAST) may reveal the specificity of the IgE antibody involved but has little help in management. Drug Allergy Drugs may cause allergic reactions by any mechanism of hypersensitivity. For example, penicillin may cause anaphylaxis, which is IgE-mediated but most responses are trivial. Penicillin cross-reacts with other semisynthetic penicillins including monobactams and carbapenems and may also cross-react with other antibiotics such as cephalosporins. Type II or Cytotoxic-Mediated Response IgG and IgM mediate cytotoxic-mediated responses against cell surface and extracellular matrix proteins. The immunoglobulins involved in this type of reaction damage cells by activating the complement system or by phagocytosis. Type II hypersensitivity reactions can be seen in immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and autoimmune neutropenia. Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) ITP is an autoimmune disorder that occurs at any age. Phagocytes destroy sensitized platelets in the peripheral blood. Clinically, it manifests as thrombocytopenia with shortened platelet survival and increased marrow megakaryocytes. Sudden onset of petechiae and bleeding from the gums, nose, bowel, and urinary tract occurs. Bleeding can accompany infections, drug reactions, malignancy, and other autoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease and SLE. Autoimmune Hemolytic anemia (AIHA) There are two types of immune hemolytic anemia: IgG-mediated (warm AIHA) and IgM-mediated (cold AIHA). The warm type may be idiopathic autoimmune or secondary to other diseases such as malignancy affecting the lymphoid tissues. The cold type may be idiopathic or secondary to infections such as Epstein-Barr virus. The primary clinical sign of the two is jaundice. The laboratory diagnosis is made by a positive Coombs test, which identifies immunoglobulins and C3 on red blood cells. Autoimmune Neutropenia Autoimmune neutropenia may be present with bacterial and fungal infections, or it may occur alone or with autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis), infections and lymphoma. Bone marrow examination is needed if neutropenia is severe. For associated autoimmune disorders, an autoimmune antibody panel is necessary (ANA, ENA, and dsDNA). Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and the Newborn (erythroblastosis fetalis) The maternal immune system suffers an initial sensitization to the fetal Rh+ red blood cells during birth when the placenta tears away. The first child escapes the disease but the mother, now sensitized, will be capable of causing a hemolytic reaction against a second Rh+ fetus, which develops anemia and jaundice once the maternal IgG crosses the placenta. Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder caused by antibodies to post-synaptic acetylcholine receptors that interfere with neuromuscular transmission. It is characterized by extreme muscular fatigue, double vision, bilateral ptosis, deconjugate eye movements, difficulty swallowing, and weakness in the upper arms. Babies born to mothers with myasthenia gravis can have transient muscle weakness due to pathogenic IgG antibodies that cross the placenta. Goodpasture Syndrome Goodpasture syndrome is a type II hypersensitivity reaction characterized by the presence of nephritis in association with lung hemorrhage. In most patients, it is caused by cross-reactive autoantigens that are present in the basement membranes of the lung and kidney. A number of patients with this problem exhibit antibodies to collagen type IV, which is an important component of basement membranes. Pemphigus Pemphigus causes a severe blistering disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. The sera of patients with pemphigus have antibodies against desmoglein-1 and desmoglein-3, which are components of desmosomes, which form junctions between epidermal cells. Pemphigus is strongly linked to HLA-DR4 (DRB1*0402), which is a molecule that presents one of the autoantigens involved in the immunopathogenesis of this disease (desmoglein-3). Type III or Immunocomplex Reactions These are also mediated by IgM and IgG antibodies that react with soluble antigens forming antigen-antibody complexes. The complement system becomes activated and releases chemotactic agents that attract neutrophils and cause inflammation and tissue damage as seen in vasculitis and glomerulonephritis. Type III hypersensitivity reactions can classically be seen in serum sickness and Arthus reaction. Serum Sickness Serum sickness can be induced with massive injections of a foreign antigen. Circulating immune complexes infiltrate the blood vessel walls and tissues, causing an increased vascular permeability and leading to inflammatory processes such as vasculitis and arthritis. It was a complication of anti-serum prepared in animals to which some individuals produced antibodies to the foreign protein. It was also experienced in the treatment with antibiotics such as penicillin. Arthus Reaction Arthus reaction is a local reaction seen when a small quantity of antigens is injected into the skin repeatedly until detectable levels of antibodies (IgG) are present. If the same antigen is inoculated, immune complexes develop at the mentioned local site and in the endothelium of small vessels. This reaction is characterized by the presence of marked edema and hemorrhage, depending on the administered dose of the foreign antigen.",0.5099502205848694

Previously, we reported that Rhus tox treatment increased the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA expression in primary cultured mouse chondrocytes. Methods: A preosteoblastic mouse cell line, MC3T3-e1, was treated with different homeopathic dilutions of Rhus tox and the COX-2 mRNA and protein expression was examined using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting. Additionally, nitric oxide (NO) generation was examined in LPS-induced MC3T3-e1 cells using a Griess reaction assay. Results: Stimulation with different concentrations of Rhus tox increased the expression of Cox2 mRNA, with 30X Rhus tox showing the most prominent increase in mRNA expression. In addition, treatment with 30X Rhus tox significantly increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release compared with other homeopathic dilutions. However, the COX-2 protein expression level differed slightly from its mRNA expression, because the 30C Rhus tox treatment increased COX-2 protein to a greater extent compared with other dilutions. NO generation was dramatically decreased in MC3T3-e1 cells after Rhus tox treatment co-stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Conclusion: Homeopathic dilution of Rhus tox has a dual activity that increases COX-2 expression and decreases NO generation, thus modulating inflammation. Further study is needed to examine the cellular signaling mechanisms that are associated with inflammatory regulation by Rhus tox treatment in greater detail.",0.41106197237968445

Clinical diagnosis of scabies was confirmed by microscopical examinations. The cream was stored in refrigerator and applied cold on the entire skin surface. The cream was left on the skin for 24 hours. No other topical or systemic drugs were allowed, except for a cleanser with chlorhexidine. The treatment was repeated in all patients 7-10 days later. The follow-up was 2 months after the end of the treatment. Results: Twenty-one patients (61.8%) in the group 1 and 34 patients (87.2%) in the group 2 were considered recovered both clinically and microscopically. Three patients (7.1%) in the group 1 and 4 patients (10.2%) in the group 2 developed a mild irritant contact dermatitis. During follow-up, three patients (7.1%) in the group 1 and two patients (4.2%) in the group 2 developed a recurrence or a re-infestation. Conclusions: Five per cent permethrin, when applied as cold cream, on the entire skin surface, once daily for two consecutive days, is more effective than the single application in adult immunocompetent patients with scabies.",0.16944487392902374

We divided SS patients into three stages: stage I is glandular SS, stage II is extraglandular SS, and stage III is extraglandular SS with lymphoid malignancy. The lymphoaggressive nature of the disease appears to lead SS patients from stage I to II and from stage II to III. However, stage III patients made up only 5% of SS patients. Many patients remain stable in stages I or II for as long as 10 or 20 years. Therefore, we can assume that there are factors which trigger patients in stages I or II to progress to stages II or III and that only those patients who have such factors progress from stages I or II to stages II or III, respectively. Accumulation in the salivary glands or in the peripheral blood of B cells which have rearrangement of the RF-related germline gene Vg or over-expression of the bcl-2 gene in the lymphoepithelial lesion might be included among these factors.",0.1662730723619461

Allicin is considered the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. This study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. Allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. The broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, and Actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 μg/mL or higher. Planktonic growth of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 μg/mL. Porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 μg/mL). Gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate N(α)-benzoyl-L-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of P. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. A gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin ( 300 μg/mL), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. Live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to S. mutans grown in mature biofilms.

Although such chemical burns typically are associated with misuse of analgesics, investigators also have reported them in conjunction with topical application of a variety of other agents. Case description: The authors report an unusual case of a 49-year-old man seeking care for maxillary tooth pain who had an oral mucosal burn of the maxillary vestibule caused by topical application of crushed raw garlic. The patient believed this treatment would alleviate his dental pain. Localized tissue necrosis was visible at the site of application. The authors instructed the patient to cease self-treatment with raw garlic but deemed treatment was otherwise unnecessary. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the second reported case of a garlic burn of the oral mucosa. The authors discuss the history of garlic as a naturopathic remedy, as well as the development of chemical burns associated with its topical use. The authors also review the literature on chemical burns caused by inappropriate self-treatment. Conclusions and practical implications: Dentists should consider the possibility of an oral chemical burn when a patient has a destructive or necrotic mucosal lesion located near a painful tooth. In this report, the authors highlight the importance of obtaining a detailed clinical history to establish a proper diagnosis and proper patient education to prevent future mucosal injury from inappropriate self-treatment.

In particular, a comparison was made between the level of control of breath odor provided by the test dentifrice, and that provided by a placebo dentifrice which did not contain triclosan or a copolymer. This study followed a two-treatment, two-period crossover design. Prospective subjects were provided with a supply of a commercially available fluoride dentifrice, which was used for a one-week period prior to the two seven-day treatment periods. During each treatment period, subjects were instructed to brush their teeth twice a day, morning and evening, for sixty seconds with their assigned study dentifrice, using the soft-bristled toothbrush which had been provided. On the morning following the seventh day of each treatment period, subjects reported to the clinical facility for overnight breath odor assessments. Directly following this, subjects brushed their teeth, ate and drank normally, and reported once again to the clinical facility at seven hours post-toothbrushing for another breath odor assessment. Prior to the overnight breath odor assessments, subjects refrained from brushing their teeth, rinsing their mouths or using breath mints, and from eating or drinking anything on the morning of the evaluation. Subjects refrained from the use of tobacco products, and from eating onions, garlic, or strong spices throughout the entire study. Breath odor was instrumentally evaluated by measuring the level of volatile sulfur compounds in the mouth air using a 565 Tracor gas chromatograph equipped with a flame photometric detector. Measurements were taken in duplicate, and then averaged. Levels of volatile sulfur compounds were expressed in nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) of mouth air. The two dentifrices exhibited statistically significant differences (p 0.05) with respect to both overnight breath odor and seven-hour post-toothbrushing breath odor. The mean overnight breath odor scores were 9.63 ng/ml for Colgate Total Toothpaste, and 12.64 ng/ml for the placebo dentifrice. For seven-hour breath odor, the mean scores were 5.62 ng/ml for Colgate Total Toothpaste, and 7.10 ng/ml for the placebo dentifrice.

Participants kept daily diaries of beverage and caffeine consumption and symptoms. Urine samples were collected to assess hormone metabolites. Descriptive statistics were generated. Results: During the first trimester, 96% of subjects decreased or quit drinking coffee, 65% of whom reported a unique aversion to coffee. The mean daily caffeine consumption at LMP from coffee alone was 119 mg (S.D., 105), with a range 1-574 mg. There was a 59% decrease of mean daily consumption of caffeine from coffee between weeks 4 and 6, from 96 to 39 mg.

The most common dietary aversions included meat, coffee, spicy foods, and dairy products. Hormone metabolite patterns are reported. Conclusion: Signals of early pregnancy included an aversion to coffee in addition to nausea and vomiting, which resulted in decreased caffeine consumption.

However, it is still unclear whether coffee consumption is an independent risk factor for bleeding in early pregnancy. The objective of this study was to examine the association between pre-pregnancy coffee consumption patterns and the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 3510 pregnant women from the Korean Pregnancy Outcome Study who underwent baseline examination and for whom the results of the pregnancy were available. Coffee consumption patterns before pregnancy were examined using a questionnaire. The participants were classified according to the frequency of coffee consumption into seldom ( 1 cup/week), light ( 1 cup/day), moderate (1 cup/day), and heavy coffee drinker (≥2 cups/day) groups. Bleeding in early pregnancy was defined as the occurrence of vaginal bleeding in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. Multiple logistic regression models were applied to examine the association between pre-pregnancy coffee consumption and the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy, after adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption behavior, previous and current physical activity levels, stress levels, history of depression, antenatal depressive symptoms during the first trimester, type of emesis, parity, and the number of livebirths, stillbirths, miscarriages, and abortions. Results: Women who were light, moderate, and heavy coffee drinkers before pregnancy had adjusted ORs of 1.086, 1.225, and 1.358, respectively, for bleeding in early pregnancy.

Objective: To determine whether caffeinated-beverage intake and plasma caffeine and paraxanthine are associated with cardiometabolic complications in pregnancy (ie, gestational diabetes [GDM], preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension [GH]). Design, setting, and participants: This cohort study used data from a longitudinal pregnancy cohort study from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal Growth Studies-Singletons (2009-2013). This post hoc secondary analysis of 2802 pregnant women without major chronic conditions enrolled at 12 US clinical sites was completed in 2021. The final sample for caffeinated beverage analyses included 2583 women. After excluding women who did not consent to have their biospecimens stored for future research (n = 54), plasma caffeine analyses included 2529 women. Analyses of caffeine consumption and fasting cardiometabolic profiles included 319 women. Exposures: Daily total caffeine intake was estimated at 10 to 13 gestational weeks and 16 to 22 gestational weeks based on self-reported past week intake of caffeinated coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. Plasma caffeine and paraxanthine were measured in specimens collected at 10 to 13 weeks. Main outcomes and measures: Clinical diagnoses of GDM, preeclampsia, GH, glucose concentrations from GDM screening, and blood pressure were extracted from medical records. Results: Participants had a mean (SD) age of 28.1 (5.5) years and 422 participants (16.3%) were Asian/Pacific Islander women, 741 (28.9%) were Hispanic women, 717 (27.8%) were non-Hispanic Black women, and 703 (27.2%) were non-Hispanic White women. At 10 to 13 weeks, 1073 women (41.5%) reported consuming no caffeinated beverages, 1317 (51.0%) reported consuming 1 mg/d to 100 mg/d, 173 (6.7%) reported consuming 101 mg/d to 200 mg/d, and 20 (0.8%) reported consuming more than 200 mg/d. At 16 to 22 weeks, 599 women (23.6%) reported consuming no caffeinated beverages, 1734 (68.3%) reported consuming 1 mg/d to 100 mg/d, 186 (7.3%) reported consuming 101 mg/d to 200 mg/d, and 20 (0.8%) reported consuming more than 200 mg/d caffeinated beverages. Intake at 16 to 22 weeks was associated with lower GDM risk and lower glucose concentrations (1 mg/d to 100 mg/d vs none: relative risk, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.80]; β, -2.7 mg/dL [95% CI, -5.4 mg/dL to 0 mg/dL]) and lower C-reactive protein and C-peptide concentrations and favorable lipid profiles. Total plasma caffeine and paraxanthine at 10 to 13 weeks was inversely associated with glucose (quartile 4 vs quartile 1: β = -3.8 mg/dL [95% CI, -7.0 mg/dL to -0.5 mg/dL]; trend of P = .01). No associations were observed with preeclampsia or GH. Conclusions and relevance: In this cohort study, second trimester caffeinated beverage intake within current recommendations was associated with lower GDM risk, but not preeclampsia or GH. These findings may be reassuring for women with moderate caffeine intake.",0.1336454153060913

Green tea is widely known to be potent antioxidant. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the effects of green tea in a model of hypertension. Methods: Hypertension was induced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor [N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME); 20 mg/kg per day, orally, for 2 weeks] in male Wistar rats. After the first week of L-NAME treatment, animals received green tea ad libitum for 1 week. At the end of the treatment period, blood pressure, heart rate, baroreflex sensitivity, renal sympathetic nerve activity, and vascular and systemic oxidative stress were assessed. Results: L-NAME-treated animals exhibited an increase in blood pressure (165 ± 2 mmHg) compared with control rats (103 ± 1 mmHg) and green tea treatment reduced hypertension (119 ± 1 mmHg). Hypertensive animals showed a higher renal sympathetic nerve activity (161 ± 12 spikes/s) than the control group (97 ± 2 spikes/s), and green tea also decreased this parameter in the hypertensive treated group (125 ± 5 spikes/s). Arterial baroreceptor function and vascular and systemic oxidative stress were improved in hypertensive rats after green tea treatment. Conclusions: Taken together, short-term green tea treatment improved cardiovascular function in a hypertension model characterized by sympathoexcitation, which may be because of its antioxidant properties.",0.4019619822502136
209,misbelief,17227956,Can green tea reduce blood pressure?,green tea reduce blood pressure,1.0,"Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a bioactive polyphenol in green tea, may augment metabolic and vascular actions of insulin. Therefore, we investigated effects of EGCG treatment to simultaneously improve cardiovascular and metabolic function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR; model of metabolic syndrome with hypertension, insulin resistance, and overweight). In acute studies, EGCG (1-100 microM) elicited dose-dependent vasodilation in mesenteric vascular beds (MVB) isolated from SHR ex vivo that was inhibitable by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; nitric oxide synthase antagonist) or wortmannin [phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor]. In chronic studies, 9-wk-old SHR were treated by gavage for 3 wk with EGCG (200 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), enalapril (30 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), or vehicle. A separate group of SHR receiving L-NAME (80 mg/l in drinking water) was treated for 3 wk with either EGCG or vehicle. Vasodilator actions of insulin were significantly improved in MVB from EGCG- or enalapril-treated SHR (when compared with vehicle-treated SHR). Both EGCG and enalapril therapy significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) in SHR. EGCG therapy of SHR significantly reduced infarct size and improved cardiac function in Langendorff-perfused hearts exposed to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. In SHR given L-NAME, beneficial effects of EGCG on SBP and I/R were not observed. Both enalapril and EGCG treatment of SHR improved insulin sensitivity and raised plasma adiponectin levels. We conclude that acute actions of EGCG to stimulate production of nitric oxide from endothelium using PI 3-kinase-dependent pathways may explain, in part, beneficial effects of EGCG therapy to simultaneously improve metabolic and cardiovascular pathophysiology in SHR. These findings may be relevant to understanding potential benefits of green tea consumption in patients with the metabolic syndrome.",0.21103502810001373
209,misbelief,24861099,Can green tea reduce blood pressure?,green tea reduce blood pressure,1.0,"Purpose: Although previous literature has reported that regular green tea consumption may improve blood pressure, the evidence from these studies is not consistent. The present study systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials and examined the effect of green tea consumption on blood pressure using meta-analysis. Methods: Search of ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library (CENTERAL) was conducted, to identify eligible articles. Articles from 1995 to 2013 were included. A random-effect model was chosen to calculate the effect of combined trials. Result: Thirteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Green tea consumption significantly changed systolic blood pressure, by -2.08 mm Hg (95% CI -3.06, -1.05), and diastolic blood pressure, by -1.71 mm Hg (95% CI -2.86, -0.56), compared to the control. Changes in lipid profile, blood glucose and body mass index were also assessed in the meta-analysis. A significant reduction was found in total cholesterol (-0.15 mmol/L [95% CI -0.27, -0.02]) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.16 mmol/L [95% CI -0.22, -0.09]). Changes in other parameters did not reach statistical significance. Subgroup analysis suggested a greater reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in studies that included participants with a baseline mean systolic blood pressure of ≥ 130 mm Hg, and studies involving consuming green tea as an extract. Conclusion: The present meta-analysis suggests that green tea and its catechins may improve blood pressure, and the effect may be greater in those with systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg. The meta-analysis also suggests that green tea catechins may improve total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.",0.4406314492225647
209,misbelief,10404946,Can green tea reduce blood pressure?,green tea reduce blood pressure,1.0,"Background: The flavonoid components of tea have been associated in epidemiological studies with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Flavonoids have been shown to have antioxidant and vasodilator effects in vitro; we therefore postulated that drinking green or black tea attenuates the well-characterized acute pressor response to caffeine and lowers blood pressure during regular consumption. Objective: To determine whether green and black tea can attenuate the transient pressor effect of caffeine, or lower blood pressure during regular consumption. Methods: In the first study, the acute effects of four hot drinks - green tea and black tea (at a dose equivalent to four standard cups), water matched to the teas for caffeine content ('caffeine') and water - were assessed in 20 normotensive men using a Latin-Square designed study. Clinic blood pressure was measured before and 30 and 60 min after each drink had been ingested. In the second study, the effects on blood pressure of regular green and black tea ingestion were examined in 13 subjects with high-normal systolic blood pressure and mild systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure in the range 130-150 mmHg) using a three-period crossover study. Five cups per day of green tea, black tea and caffeine (in hot water and matched to the teas) were consumed for 7 days each, in random order. Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured at the end of each seven-day intervention. Results are presented as means and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: An acute pressor response to caffeine was observed. Relative to caffeine, there were further acute increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 30 min among those drinking green tea [5.5 mmHg (95%CI -1.4 to 12.4) and 3.1 mmHg (95%CI -0.1 to 6.3), respectively] and black tea [10.7 mmHg (95%CI 4.0 to 17.4) and 5.1 mmHg (95%CI 1.8 to 8.4), respectively]. The changes in blood pressure at 60 min were not significant The effect on 24-h ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure of regular drinking of green tea [increases of 1.7 mmHg (95%CI -1.6 to 5.0) and 0.9 mmHg (95%CI -1.3 to 3.1), respectively] or black tea [increase of 0.7 mmHg (95%CI -2.6 to 4.0) and decrease of 0.7 mmHg (95%CI -2.9 to 1.5), respectively] was not significant relative to caffeine. Conclusions: Contrary to our initial hypothesis, tea ingestion caused larger acute increases in blood pressure than caffeine alone. However, any acute effects of tea on blood pressure did not translate into significant alterations in ambulatory blood pressure during regular tea consumption.",0.14613331854343414
209,misbelief,23845542,Can green tea reduce blood pressure?,green tea reduce blood pressure,1.0,"Green tea, Camellia sinensis (Theaceae), a major source of flavonoids such as catechins, has recently shown multiple cardiovascular health benefits through various experimental and clinical studies. These studies suggest that green tea catechins prevent the incidence of detrimental cardiovascular events, and also lower the cardiovascular mortality rate. Catechins present in green tea have the ability to prevent atherosclerosis, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, ischemic heart diseases, cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy and congestive heart failure by decreasing oxidative stress, preventing inflammatory events, reducing platelet aggregation and halting the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Catechins afford an anti-oxidant effect by inducing anti-oxidant enzymes, inhibiting pro-oxidant enzymes and scavenging free radicals. Catechins present anti-inflammatory activity through the inhibition of transcriptional factor NF-κB-mediated production of cytokines and adhesion molecules. Green tea catechins interfere with vascular growth factors and thus inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and also inhibit thrombogenesis by suppressing platelet adhesion. Additionally, catechins could protect vascular endothelial cells and enhance vascular integrity and regulate blood pressure. In this review various experimental and clinical studies suggesting the role of green tea catechins against the markers of cardiovascular disorders and the underlying mechanisms for these actions are discussed.",0.4937506318092346

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation with EGCG on insulin resistance and associated metabolic risk factors in man. Overweight or obese male subjects, aged 40-65 years, were randomly assigned to take 400 mg capsules of EGCG (n 46) or the placebo lactose (n 42), twice daily for 8 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance testing and measurement of metabolic risk factors (BMI, waist circumference, percentage body fat, blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, TAG) was conducted pre- and post-intervention. Mood was evaluated weekly using the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology mood adjective checklist. EGCG treatment had no effect on insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion or glucose tolerance but did reduce diastolic blood pressure (mean change: placebo - 0.058 (se 0.75) mmHg; EGCG - 2.68 (se 0.72) mmHg; P = 0.014). No significant change in the other metabolic risk factors was observed. The EGCG group also reported feeling in a more positive mood than the placebo group across the intervention period (mean score for hedonic tone: EGCG, 29.11 (se 0.44); placebo, 27.84 (se 0.46); P = 0.048). In conclusion, regular intake of EGCG had no effect on insulin resistance but did result in a modest reduction in diastolic blood pressure. This antihypertensive effect may contribute to some of the cardiovascular benefits associated with habitual green tea consumption. EGCG treatment also had a positive effect on mood. Further studies are needed to confirm the findings and investigate their mechanistic basis.",0.20691153407096863

Research methods and procedures: Japanese women and men with visceral fat-type obesity were recruited for the trial. After a 2-week diet run-in period, a 12-week double-blind parallel multicenter trial was performed, in which the subjects ingested green tea containing 583 mg of catechins (catechin group) or 96 mg of catechins (control group) per day. Randomization was stratified by gender and body mass index at each medical institution. The subjects were instructed to maintain their usual dietary intake and normal physical activity. Results: Data were analyzed using per-protocol samples of 240 subjects (catechin group; n = 123, control group; n = 117). Decreases in body weight, body mass index, body fat ratio, body fat mass, waist circumference, hip circumference, visceral fat area, and subcutaneous fat area were found to be greater in the catechin group than in the control group. A greater decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was found in the catechin group compared with the control group for subjects whose initial SBP was 130 mm Hg or higher. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was also decreased to a greater extent in the catechin group. No adverse effect was found. Discussion: The continuous ingestion of a GTE high in catechins led to a reduction in body fat, SBP, and LDL cholesterol, suggesting that the ingestion of such an extract contributes to a decrease in obesity and cardiovascular disease risks.",0.25671836733818054

The aim of the current project was to investigate the effect of green tea (Japanese Sencha), black tea (Indian Assam B.O.P.) and Rooibos tea (South Africa) on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and nitric oxide (NO). Design: Seventeen healthy volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 ml green tea, black tea or Rooibos tea in a randomized, three-phase, crossover study. ACE activity and NO concentration were measured (at 0, 30, 60 and 180 min) in all phases. ACE activity was analysed by means of a commercial radioenzymatic assay. Nitrite was analysed as a marker of NO concentration. In addition, ACE genotype was determined using a PCR method. Results: Oral intake of a single dose of Rooibos tea significantly inhibited ACE activity after 30 min (P 0.01) and after 60 min (P 0.05). A significant inhibition of ACE activity was seen with green tea for the ACE II genotype 30 min after intake of the tea (P 0.05) and for the ACE ID genotype 60 min after intake (P 0.05). A significant inhibition of ACE activity was also seen with Rooibos tea for the ACE II genotype 60 min after intake (P 0.05). No significant effect on NO concentration was seen.

We have thus aimed to isolate the randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of black or green tea as a beverage in subjects with elevated blood pressure (BP), or HTN. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest dissertations and theses databases were searched from February 1, 1995, up to July 20, 2019, to identify relevant studies. Results: The search strategy generated 1119 trials, of which finally five trials fulfilled the criteria for being included in the current study. Three out of 5 articles showed a low risk of bias. According to nine measurements derived from 5 trials on 408 individuals, it was found that regular tea intake resulted in the reduction in SBP (weighted mean difference (WMD): -4.81 mmHg, 95 %CI: -8.40 to -1.58, P = .004) and DBP (WMD:-1.98 mmHg, 95 %CI: -3.77 to -0.20, P = .029); however, excluding the most heterogeneous trials showed that regular tea intake might reduce SBP and DBP by about -3.53 and -0.99 mmHg, respectively. Based on meta-regression findings, we found the longer the duration of tea intake (≥3months), the higher the decrease in both SBP and DBP. Categorized studies, according to the tea type, revealed that the hypotensive effects of green tea were more pronounced compared to black tea. None of the studies reported any side effects. Conclusion: These results suggest the positive effects of regular tea intake on BP in subjects with elevated BP or HTN. Hence, it may be applicable to physicians, health care providers, and particularly HTN patients.",0.586965024471283

The incidence and death rate of some of these cancers are very high. Although a large variety of chemotherapeutic agents have been introduced since the last few decades to combat GI cancer, most of them are very expensive and have side effects. Therefore, the compounds derived from natural sources, which are considered to be safe and cost effective, are needed. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is one of the most widely used natural products consumed as a spice and medicine for treating nausea, dysentery, heartburn, flatulence, diarrhea, loss of appetite, infections, cough, and bronchitis. Experimental studies showed that ginger and its active components including 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol exert anticancer activities against GI cancer. The anticancer activity of ginger is attributed to its ability to modulate several signaling molecules like NF-κB, STAT3, MAPK, PI3K, ERK1/2, Akt, TNF-α, COX-2, cyclin D1, cdk, MMP-9, survivin, cIAP-1, XIAP, Bcl-2, caspases, and other cell growth regulatory proteins.

The available literature survey on this plant provided scarce anecdotal information, particularly in western and eastern Africa, with a few reports on its bioactivity. In addition, the indigenous knowledge and conservation strategies of this economically important and critically endangered species are currently fragmented. Aim of the review: This review entails a critical appraisal of existing literature on the ethnomedicinal uses, biological activities, phytochemicals, research opportunities and prospects for the sustainable use of S. aethiopicus. Materials and methods: This review was conducted using a comprehensive literature search on the ethnomedicinal uses, biological activities and phytochemistry of S. aethiopicus throughout its distributional range. The conservation status and associated bio-economy potential of African ginger were also assessed. We searched different online databases (e.g. Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Scopus) for peer-reviewed journals, conference outputs, international, regional and national organizational reports, published books and theses. Results: We established that S. aethiopicus is used to treat a wide variety of ailments such as respiratory problems (including cough, influenza), pain, inflammation and malaria. Extracts of African ginger are used as an ingredient in some commercialised products for nutraceutical, cosmeceutical and pharmaceutical purposes. The rhizome extract demonstrated anti-asthmatic, anti-inflammatory, and antiplasmodial activities, which led to the development of a patented novel extract for treating asthma and allergies. Phytochemical analysis of leaf, root and rhizome extracts of African ginger revealed the presence of flavonoids, phenolic acids, volatile and essential oils as the major constituents. These phytochemicals are known to possess bioactivities such as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. Particularly, the bioactive compounds, siphonochilone and eucalyptol, found in the roots and rhizomes have demonstrated potential to be used in remedies for treating asthma and allergic reactions. Furthermore, extracts of S. aethiopicus contained natural anti-inflammatory mediators with potential to combat and manage chronic inflammation. This plant is classified on the Red List of South African Plants as a critically endangered plant. Its high risk of extinction due to its unsustainable harvesting and exploitation necessitates its rapid propagation and cultivation to meet its increasing demand. Conclusions: The review highlights the therapeutic potential of S. aethiopicus and rational prioritization of this plant species with the potential for isolating new bioactive compounds. In the light of the use of this plant extract in traditional medicine and many commercial products, there is a heightened need to explore the mechanism(s) of action of the identified extracts and bioactive compounds in order to fully understand their pharmacokinetics and probably elucidate the pathways of their activities.",0.6657659411430359

However, there has never been evidence to support the effectiveness of ginger in increasing the breast milk volume. Objectives: To compare breast milk volume on the third and seventh day postpartum between lactating mothers who receive 500 mg dried ginger capsules twice daily with those receiving placebo. Materials and methods: A randomized, double-blind controlled trial was conducted. Women who deliver a term baby were randomly assigned to receive dried ginger or placebo for 7 days postpartum. Breast milk volume was measured on third day postpartum using test weight method for a period of 24 hours and on seventh day postpartum using 1 hour milk production. We also compared the third day serum prolactin level between the two groups. Results: Data from 63 women were available for analysis, 30 from the ginger group and 33 from the placebo group. The two groups were similar regarding baseline characteristics. Women in the ginger group have higher milk volume than the placebo group (191.0 ± 71.2 mL/day versus 135.0 ± 61.5 mL/day, p 0.01). However, the seventh day milk volume in the ginger group does not differ from the placebo group (80.0 ± 58.5 mL versus 112.1 ± 91.6 mL, p = 0.24). The mean serum prolactin levels were similar in both groups (321.5 ± 131.8 ng/L in the ginger group, and 331.4 ± 100.7 ng/L in the placebo group, p = 0.74). No side effect was reported in this study.

Methods: Forty adults (18-60 yr), ASA physical status I and II of either sex, undergoing elective lumber laminectomy were randomized into two groups of 20 each. Group C: received water; Group L: received 0.5 g licorice in water. Both groups received a 30 mL mixture for 30 s, 5 min before anesthesia which was standardized. The incidence and severity of POST at rest and on swallowing and side effects were assessed at 0, 2, 4, and 24 h, postoperatively. Severity of POST was assessed by visual analog scale (between 0 and 100 mm; where 0 means no sore throat and 100 means worst imaginable sore throat). Postextubation cough was assessed immediately after tracheal extubation. Data were analyzed by Z test and Fisher's exact test. P 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: POST (incidence and severity) was reduced in the Group L compared with Group C at rest and on swallowing for all time points (P 0.05), except that the severity of POST at rest, at 24 h, was similar in both groups (P &gt; 0.05). Postextubation cough was reduced in Group L compared with Group C (P 0.05). There was no difference in side effects between groups (P &gt; 0.05).

A chronic cough is a non-specific reaction to irritation anywhere in the respiratory system. It usually lasts for more than eight weeks. The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of a modified traditional Persian medicine preparation, licorice pastille, in healing a chronic cough. Methods: Through a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in a respiratory disease clinic in Shiraz, Iran; between October 2016 and December 2017. Seventy participants with a chronic cough took part in the trial. The outcome measures were as the daily cough scores (the score being logged via patient symptoms, diary, and the visual analogue scale) and the quality of life measure of chronic cough according to the Leicester Cough Questionnaire. Results: At baseline, there were no significant differences in the demographic or clinical (cough score) characteristics between the two groups. There was complete adherence to protocol in both groups but, the drop-out rate was 4 patients in the placebo and 6 ones in the intervention groups. The results at the end of the trial (Week 2) and follow-up (Week 4) demonstrated the efficacy of the licorice pastille in terms of the cough severity score against the placebo group. This item showed a significant decrease in the intervention group (1.2 ± 0.93) comparing to the placebo one (1.8 ± 1.03) at follow-up time.

Patients and methods: Between January and March 2004, 13 general practitioners recruited and treated 62 patients with a mean age of 50 years (range 16-89). The patients had irritating cough in consequence of common cold (n = 29), bronchitis (n = 20) or respiratory tract diseases with formation of viscous mucus (n = 15). The mean daily intake was 10 ml (range 7.5-15) of syrup, and the mean duration of treatment was 12 days (range 3-23 days). Treatment results were assessed on the basis of changes in the symptom scores for cough and expectoration. Safety was evaluated by means of an analysis of adverse events. In addition, efficacy and tolerability were analyzed from the judgments of the doctors and patients. Results: At the final visit, all symptom scores showed an improvement as compared to baseline. Doctors and patients assessed efficacy as good or very good in 86% and 90% of the cases, respectively. Tolerability was assessed as good or very good by 97% of the doctors and patients. Only one adverse event was reported. However, a relation to the medication was classified to be unlikely.

After the baseline examination (Visit 1 = Day 0), 2 control examinations were scheduled (Visit 2 = Day 4; Visit 3 = Day 10/end of treatment). The efficacy of study treatment on acute bronchitis was evaluated by the patient's daily counting of coughing fits during the daytime (manual counter), assessment of acute bronchitis related symptoms and by the investigator's assessment of the most important symptoms of acute bronchitis using the BSS. Evaluation of tolerability was based upon adverse event (AE) monitoring, measurement of vital signs as well as the Primary outcome was the change in frequency of coughing fits during daytime on days 7-9 according to patient's accurate daily recording with a manual counter and documentation in the diary. Treatment effects were analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) adjusted for centre effects. Due to significant deviation from the ""preconditions"" of the ANOVA, the Wilcoxon test (stratified by centre) was carried out additionally. Results: The mean reduction in coughing fits on days 7 to 9 relative to baseline was 68.7% under thyme-ivy combination compared to 47.6 % under placebo (p 0.0001).

This review article examines 3 popular herbal immune stimulants that are often of interest to cancer patients. Echinacea, a native of North America, is widely used to prevent, or provide early treatment for, colds. Preclinical studies lend biological plausibility to the idea that echinacea works through immune mechanisms. Numerous clinical trials have been carried out on echinacea preparations: it appears that the extracts shorten the duration and severity of colds and other upper respiratory infections (URIs) when given as soon as symptoms become evident. However, trials of long-term use of echinacea as a preventive have not shown positive results. Ginseng has been studied in some depth as an antifatigue agent, but studies of immune mechanisms have not proceeded so far. Preclinical evidence shows some immune-stimulating activity. There have been several clinical trials in a variety of different diseases. Astragalus is the least-studied agent. There are some preclinical trials that show intriguing immune activity. The herbs discussed appear to have satisfactory safety profiles. Cancer patients may wish to use these botanicals to inhibit tumor growth or to boost resistance to infections. However, passive immunotherapy with herbs, with no mechanism to expose tumor antigens, is unlikely to be effective in inhibiting tumor growth.

Because Echinacea can increase immune function, there is a concern that it could worsen over-activation of the immune system in cytokine storm; however, clinical trials show that Echinacea decreases levels of immune molecules involved in cytokine storm. Verdict: Echinacea supplementation may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and the common cold, particularly when administered at the first sign of infection; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Previous studies have reported that Echinacea may decrease the severity and/or duration of ARI when taken at the onset of symptoms. The studies reporting benefit used E. purpurea or a combination of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia containing standardized amounts of active constituents.Few adverse events from the use of Echinacea were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. No human trials could be located reporting evidence of cytokine storm when Echinacea was used for up to 4 months.When assessing all human trials which reported changes in cytokine levels in response to Echinacea supplementation, the results were largely consistent with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the progression of cytokine storm and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), factors that play a significant role in the death of COVID-19 patients.

To maintain robust immunity, athletes should eat a well-balanced diet sufficient to meet their energy, carbohydrate, protein, and micronutrient requirements. Dietary deficiencies of protein and specific micronutrients have long been associated with immune dysfunction and an adequate intake of iron, zinc, and vitamins A, D, E, B6 and B12 is particularly important in the maintenance of immune function. Consuming carbohydrate during prolonged strenuous exercise attenuates rises in stress hormones and appears to limit the degree of exercise-induced immune depression. Similar effects can be seen with daily ingestion of high-dose antioxidant vitamin supplements, though concerns have been expressed that excessive antioxidant intake may impair exercise training adaptations. It is safe to say with reasonable confidence that individual amino acids, colostrum, Echinacea, and zinc are unlikely to boost immunity or reduce infection risk in athletes.

In contrast, no change in inhibitory synaptic transmission could be detected upon application of this extract. In addition, our experiments revealed that at low concentration the Echinacea extract reduced the spiking activity of CA1 pyramidal cells, while at high concentration increased it. This latter observation was parallel to the reduction in the magnitude of the h-current-mediated voltage responses in pyramidal cells. At any concentrations, the passive membrane properties of CA1 pyramidal cells were found to be unaltered by the Echinacea extract.

Dietary deficiencies of protein and specific micronutrients have long been associated with immune dysfunction. An adequate intake of iron, zinc and vitamins A, E, B6 and B12 is particularly important for the maintenance of immune function, but excess intakes of some micronutrients can also impair immune function and have other adverse effects on health. Immune system depression has also been associated with an excess intake of fat. To maintain immune function, athletes should eat a well-balanced diet sufficient to meet their energy requirements. An athlete exercising in a carbohydrate-depleted state experiences larger increases in circulating stress hormones and a greater perturbation of several immune function indices. Conversely, consuming 30-60 g carbohydrate x h(-1) during sustained intensive exercise attenuates rises in stress hormones such as cortisol and appears to limit the degree of exercise-induced immune depression. Convincing evidence that so-called 'immune-boosting' supplements, including high doses of antioxidant vitamins, glutamine, zinc, probiotics and Echinacea, prevent exercise-induced immune impairment is currently lacking.",0.18703877925872803

These larvae were then assayed for RNA levels of genes encoding two antibacterial peptides, abaecin and defensin. Larvae exposed to either P. l. larvae or a mix of nonpathogenic bacteria showed high RNA levels for the abaecin gene relative to controls. First instars responded significantly to the presence of the nonpathogenic mix within 12 h after exposure, a time when they remain highly susceptible to bacterial invasion. This response was sustained for two successive instars, eventually becoming 21-fold higher in larvae exposed to probiotic spores versus control larvae. The mixture of nonpathogenic bacteria is therefore presented as a potential surrogate for assaying the immune responses of different honey bee lineages. It also is proposed that nonpathogenic bacteria can be used as a probiotic to enhance honey bee immunity, helping bee larvae, and other life stages, survive attacks from pathogens in the field.",0.27213603258132935

Previous data indicate that honey can stimulate cytokine production from human monocytes. The present study further examines this phenomenon in manuka honey. As inflammatory cytokine production in innate immune cells is classically mediated by pattern recognition receptors in response to microorganisms, bacterial contamination of honey and the effect of blocking TLR2 and -4 on stimulatory activity were assessed. No vegetative bacteria were isolated from honey; however, bacterial spores were cultured from one-third of samples, and low levels of LPS were detected. Blocking TLR4 but not TLR2 inhibited honey-stimulated cytokine production significantly. Cytokine production did not correlate with LPS levels in honey and was not inhibited by polymyxin B. Further, the activity was reduced significantly following heat treatment, indicating that component(s) other than LPS are responsible for the stimulatory activity of manuka honey. To identify the component responsible for inducing cytokine production, honey was separated by molecular weight using microcon centrifugal filtration and fractions assessed for stimulatory activity. The active fraction was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, which demonstrated the presence of a number of components of varying molecular weights. Additional fractionation using miniaturized, reverse-phase solid-phase extraction resulted in the isolation of a 5.8-kDa component, which stimulated production of TNF-alpha via TLR4. These findings reveal mechanisms and components involved in honey stimulation of cytokine induction and could potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutics to improve wound healing for patients with acute and chronic wounds.",0.35681623220443726

Objectives: In the current study, the use of vitamin and zinc supplements, medicinal plants, honey, garlic, and immune-boosting drinks among Egyptian living in Benha city were investigated during the corona pandemic. Methods: An online questionnaire was distributed through Google forms. A total of 301 adult participants (age range: 18-82) from Benha city, Egypt were included in the study. The Chi2 goodness of fit test was used to determine the differences in the distribution of the participant responses. Results: The use of vitamin C and D were reported by 27% and 17.7% of participants. About one-third of participants reported the use of immune-boosting drinks, honey, and garlic during the pandemic to strengthen the body immunity. The use of Zingiber officinale and Curcuma longa was reported by 47.2% and 31.6% respectively. Concerning zinc supplements, only 5.6% of the sample reported using it during the pandemic.

Vitamin C contributes to maintaining the redox integrity of cells and thereby protects them against reactive oxygen species generated during the respiratory burst and in the inflammatory response. Likewise, zinc undernutrition or deficiency was shown to impair cellular mediators of innate immunity such as phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity, and the generation of oxidative burst. Therefore, both nutrients play important roles in immune function and the modulation of host resistance to infectious agents, reducing the risk, severity, and duration of infectious diseases. This is of special importance in populations in which insufficient intake of these nutrients is prevalent. In the developing world, this is the case in low- and middle-income countries, but also in subpopulations in industrialized countries, e.g. in the elderly.

Seven kinds of honey, different in their origin (three from Yemen, two from the United Arab Emirates, one from Germany, and one from India), color, and duration of storage, were investigated for the presence of NO metabolites. The assessment of NO metabolites was performed before and after exposure of the honey samples to heating (80 degrees C for 1 hour) or ultraviolet light (for 24 hours). Seven healthy male sheep were used for the study. Fresh unprocessed yellow honey (2 g/kg of body weight) was infused over a period of 45 minutes to each fasting sheep. Plasma and urinary NO metabolites were measured before and after the infusion. All the honey samples examined had various concentrations of NO metabolites; the highest concentration was in the fresh dark honey collected from Yemen, and the lowest in 1-year-stored dark honey collected from India. Darker or fresh honeys contained more NO metabolites than light or stored honey. After heating, NO metabolites decreased in all the kinds of honey. After ultraviolet exposure, NO metabolites were decreased in four kinds of honey, increased in one kind, and unchanged in two kinds. The darker stored honey had more resistance to heating and ultraviolet exposure. Intravenous infusion of honey elevated urinary NO metabolites from 8.4 +/- 7.4 micromol/L to 14.9 +/- 10 micromol/L during the first 60-90 min after infusion and to 35.2 +/- 34 micromol/L during the next 150-180 min.

The phytochemicals p-coumaric acid and quercetin, which occur naturally in a wide variety of bee foods, including beebread and many types of honey, can enhance adult bee longevity and reduce the toxicity of certain pesticides. How variation in concentrations of natural dietary constituents affects interactions with xenobiotics, including synthetic pesticides, encountered in agroecosystems remains an open question. We tested the effects of these two phytochemicals at a range of natural concentrations on impacts of consuming propiconazole and chlorantraniliprole, a triazole fungicide and an insecticide frequently applied as a tank mix to almond trees during bloom in California's Central Valley. Propiconazole, even at low field concentrations, significantly reduced survival and longevity when consumed by adult bees in a sugar-based diet. The effects of propiconazole in combination with chlorantraniliprole enhanced mortality risk. The detrimental effects of the two pesticides were for the most part reduced when either or both of the phytochemicals were present in the diet. These findings suggest that honey bees may depend on non-nutritive but physiologically active phytochemical components of their natural foods for ameliorating xenobiotic stress, although only over a certain range of concentrations; particularly at the high end of the natural range, certain combinations can incur additive toxicity. Thus, efforts to develop nectar or pollen substitutes with phytochemicals to boost insecticide tolerance or immunity or to evaluate toxicity of pesticides to pollinators should take concentration-dependent effects of phytochemicals into consideration.",0.20545031130313873

Here we hypothesize that N. ceranae intensity and prevalence will be low in bees receiving high pollen diets, and that honey bees on high pollen diets will have higher survival and/or increased longevity. To test this hypothesis we examined the effects of different quantities of pollen on (a) the intensity and prevalence of N. ceranae and (b) longevity and nutritional physiology of bees inoculated with N. ceranae. Significantly higher spore intensities were observed in treatments that received higher pollen quantities (1:0 and 1:1 pollen:cellulose) when compared to treatments that received relatively lower pollen quantities. There were no significant differences in N. ceranae prevalence among different pollen diet treatments. Interestingly, the bees in higher pollen quantity treatments also had significantly higher survival despite higher intensities of N. ceranae. Significantly higher hypopharyngeal gland protein was observed in the control (no Nosema infection, and receiving a diet of 1:0 pollen:cellulose), followed by 1:0 pollen:cellulose treatment that was inoculated with N. ceranae.

The purpose of this review was to summarize the influence of aged garlic extract (AGE) on the immune system. The author's laboratory is interested in AGE's effects on cell proliferation and activation and inflammation and to learn whether those changes might affect the occurrence and severity of colds and flu. Healthy human participants (n = 120), between 21 and 50 y of age, were recruited for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-intervention study to consume 2.56 g AGE/d or placebo supplements for 90 d during the cold and flu season. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated before and after consumption, and γδ-T and NK cell function was assessed by flow cytometry. The effect on cold and flu symptoms was determined by using daily diary records of self-reported illnesses. After 45 d of AGE consumption, γδ-T and NK cells proliferated better and were more activated than cells from the placebo group. After 90 d, although the number of illnesses was not significantly different, the AGE group showed reduced cold and flu severity, with a reduction in the number of symptoms, the number of days participants functioned suboptimally, and the number of work/school days missed. These results suggest that AGE supplementation may enhance immune cell function and may be partly responsible for the reduced severity of colds and flu reported. The results also suggest that the immune system functions well with AGE supplementation, perhaps with less accompanying inflammation.

The efficacies of extracts were tested using well diffusion method, and its effect was evaluated by measuring the zone of inhibition around the well. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts was carried out individually and compared considering triplicates of all the extracts. Results: When individual comparison of the extracts was made, garlic showed greatest antimicrobial activity with a mean zone of inhibition (34.9 ± 0.58 mm) and honey showed least antimicrobial activity (0.5 ± 0.6 mm). When combinations of extracts were tested against S. mutans, lemon and garlic combination showed the greatest zone of inhibition (27.6 ± 0.43 mm) compared with other combinations, and ginger + lemon combinations showed the least zone of inhibition (12.6 ± 0.43 mm). Conclusion: This study concluded that garlic showed a greatest antimicrobial effect against S. mutans when compared with other preparations individually and garlic and lemon showed greatest zone of inhibition in combination than other preparations.

Objective: To assess whether oral zinc was effective in treating viral warts of patients evaluated between May 1999 and April 2000. Patients and methods: This was a placebo-controlled clinical trial. Eighty patients with viral warts (common, plantar and plane) were all resistant to all forms of treatment. Each patient had &gt; 15 warts. Forty patients were treated by oral zinc sulphate at a dose of 10 mg kg(-1) daily up to 600 mg day(-1) and followed-up for resolution of their warts and for any evidence of recurrence for 2-6 months. Another 40 patients were given a placebo oral treatment in the form of glucose, and followed-up for the same period.

In this work, we present an initial step toward a gene therapy approach aimed at the activation of latent provirus to induce the death of latently infected T cells. Latent HIV-1 infection is characterized by the failure of viral gene expression as a consequence of uninitiated or aborted transcription. We have constructed an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector (p5p53RTAT3) that expresses the viral trans-activating protein Tat in a drug-regulated manner and p53 in a Rev-dependent manner. We have demonstrated that the Tat-expressed protein from p5p53RTAT3 vector reactivates latent HIV-1 proviruses in J1.1 and ACH-2 cell lines and promotes p53-induced apoptosis in the presence of Rev.

Allicin gives crushed garlic its characteristic odor and its volatility makes it potentially useful for combating lung infections. Allicin was synthesized (&gt;98% pure) by oxidation of diallyl disulfide by H₂O₂ using formic acid as a catalyst and the growth inhibitory effect of allicin vapor and allicin in solution to clinical isolates of lung pathogenic bacteria from the genera Pseudomonas , Streptococcus , and Staphylococcus , including multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains, was demonstrated. Minimal inhibitory (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined and compared to clinical antibiotics using standard European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) procedures. The cytotoxicity of allicin to human lung and colon epithelial and murine fibroblast cells was tested in vitro and shown to be ameliorated by glutathione (GSH). Similarly, the sensitivity of rat precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) to allicin was decreased by raising the [GSH] to the approximate blood plasma level of 1 mM. Because allicin inhibited bacterial growth as a vapor, it could be used to combat bacterial lung infections via direct inhalation. Since there are no volatile antibiotics available to treat pulmonary infections, allicin, particularly at sublethal doses in combination with oral antibiotics, could make a valuable addition to currently available treatments.",0.19110460579395294

Another aspect of the study was to find out whether these substances have any effect on nitric oxide (NO) and free radical production. Methods: After the induction of colitis with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid in 64 male rats, physiological saline, honey, prednisolone and disulfiram enemas were applied to the rats once daily for 3 days (acute treatment groups) or 7 days (chronic treatment groups). Control groups received only saline enemas. Rats were killed on the 4th or 8th days and their colonic mucosal damage was quantitated using a scoring system. Acute and chronic inflammatory responses were determined by a mucosal injury score, histological examination and measurement of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity of tissues. The content of malonylaldehyde (MDA) and NO metabolites in colon homogenates was also measured to assess the effects of these substances on NO and free oxygen radical production. Results: Estimation of colonic damage by mucosal injury scoring was found to be strongly correlated with the histologic evaluation of colon specimens. On the other hand, mucosal injury scores were not correlated with MPO, MDA or NO values. There were significant differences between the MPO results of chronic-control and chronic-honey groups, as well as chronic-control and chronic-prednisolone groups (p = 0.03 and p = 0.0007). The acute honey, prednisolone, and disulfiram groups had significantly lower MDA results compared to the acute control group (p = 0.04, p = 0.02, and p = 0.04). In terms of NO, there was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups. NO was found to have a strong relationship with MDA (p = 0.03) and MPO values (p = 0.001). On the other hand, MPO results were not found to be correlated with MDA values (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: MPO activity is not directly proportional to the severity of the inflammation, but it may only determine the amount of neutrophil in the tissues. Inflammatory cells are not the sole intensifying factor in colitis. Therefore, mucosal injury scores may not correlate well with MPO activities. In an inflammatory state NO and MPO levels have a strong relationship, since NO is released from the neutrophils. In an inflammatory model of colitis, intrarectal honey administration is as effective as prednisolone treatment. Honey may have some features in the treatment of colitis, but this issue requires further investigation. Honey, prednisolone and even disulfiram also have some value in preventing the formation of free radicals released from the inflamed tissues. Prednisolone may also have some possible benefits in the inhibition of NO production in colitis therapy.",0.229493647813797

The main results confirmed earlier findings.Mortality ratios for cigarette smokers as compared with nonsmokers were 1.73 for all causes of death, 1.58 for all cardiovascular diseases, 2.12 for all cancers, and 4.31 for all respiratory diseases. The highest ratios (those greater than 5.0) were observed for cor pulmonale, aortic aneurysm, emphysema and bronchitis, cancer of the pharynx, cancer of the esophagus, cancer of the larynx, and cancer of the lung and bronchus. The greatest excess in deaths in terms of observed numbers minus expected was found for the cardiovascular diseases, in particular for coronary heart disease.Mortality ratios for ex-cigarette smokers who had stopped smoking for reasons other than physicians' orders were much lower compared with nonsmokers than the mortality ratios for current cigarette smokers: 1.21 for all causes, 1.15 for all cardiovascular diseases, 1.39 for all cancers, and 2.08 for all respiratory diseases. For most causes of death, the mortality ratios for ex-cigarette smokers who had stopped smoking for reasons other than physicians' orders varied inversely with the number of years of cessation. For some diseases, the mortality risk for the ex-cigarette smoker returned to normal almost immediately after the cessation of smoking, whereas for others, the return to normal was more gradual. The first group included stroke and the combined category of influenza and pneumonia; the second group included cardiovascular diseases as a whole and coronary heart disease. For still other diseases, although the mortality ratio declined with the length of time smoking was discontinued, substantial excess risks remained even after 20 years of cessation. In this third group were aortic aneurysm, bronchitis and emphysema, and lung cancer-diseases with very high mortality ratios for current cigarette smokers.

Quantifying these will provide insight into the effects of recent trends and the implications of missed prevention opportunities. Objectives: To identify and quantify the leading causes of mortality in the United States. Design: Comprehensive MEDLINE search of English-language articles that identified epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory studies linking risk behaviors and mortality. The search was initially restricted to articles published during or after 1990, but we later included relevant articles published in 1980 to December 31, 2002. Prevalence and relative risk were identified during the literature search. We used 2000 mortality data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify the causes and number of deaths. The estimates of cause of death were computed by multiplying estimates of the cause-attributable fraction of preventable deaths with the total mortality data. Main outcome measures: Actual causes of death. Results: The leading causes of death in 2000 were tobacco (435 000 deaths; 18.1% of total US deaths), poor diet and physical inactivity (365 000 deaths; 15.2%) [corrected], and alcohol consumption (85 000 deaths; 3.5%). Other actual causes of death were microbial agents (75 000), toxic agents (55 000), motor vehicle crashes (43 000), incidents involving firearms (29 000), sexual behaviors (20 000), and illicit use of drugs (17 000). Conclusions: These analyses show that smoking remains the leading cause of mortality. However, poor diet and physical inactivity may soon overtake tobacco as the leading cause of death. These findings, along with escalating health care costs and aging population, argue persuasively that the need to establish a more preventive orientation in the US health care and public health systems has become more urgent.",0.25947999954223633

The results of a case-control study designed to assess the relationship between smoking and all causes of sudden and premature death are reported. Methods: A questionnaire on the previous history and causes of death of all people buried in the Municipal Cemetery of Valencia (1986-1987) was administered to the relatives of the deceased. Among 4718 deaths, 284 victims of sudden death were identified, and 495 people who had not died suddenly were randomly sampled as controls. Results: The proportion of smokers among the women studied was extremely low in contrast to 58.9% of men in the sudden death study group and 59.2% of men in the non-sudden death study group who smoked. Smokers died on average 10 years younger than non-smokers in the sudden-death group (63.3 +/- 12.3 and 73.3 +/- 11.0 years respectively; P 0.001), and 8 years earlier in the non-sudden death group (68.5 +/- 13.3 and 76.8 +/- 13.2 years, respectively; P 0.001). A logistic regression model showed that smokers had an adjusted relative risk of 0.81 for sudden death compared with non-smokers (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-1.46).

Evidence for differential associations between menthol and nonmenthol cigarettes indicates lower cancer risk for menthol smokers, but for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, evidence has been inconsistent. Methods and results: Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute hazard ratios and accompanying 95% confidence intervals for all-cause and CVD mortality for menthol compared with nonmenthol cigarette smokers among 65 600 participants in the Southern Community Cohort Study, an ongoing community-based cohort with the largest number of menthol smokers being traced. Among the 27 619 current cigarette smokers, 4224 died during follow-up, with 1130 deaths attributed to CVD.

1_h,health_belief,32265615,Does smoking cause death?,smoking causes death,1.0,"Introduction: The All Causes of Death Surveillance (ACDS) system was used to measure smoking-attributed mortality by inserting questions on smoking on death certificates. Smoking status information of the deceased has been routinely collected in death certificates since 2010. We describe a death registry-based case-control study using smoking and cause-of-death data for the period 2010-15. Methods: From 2010, three questions about the smoking status of the deceased were inserted in a revised death certificate: 1) Smoking status (current smoker, quit smoking, never smoker); 2) Number of cigarettes per day smoked; and 3) Number of years of smoking. A data-accuracy survey of 1788 telephone interviews of the family of the deceased was also conducted. Smoking habits (current/ex-smoker vs non-smoker) were compared in study cases (persons who died of lung cancer and other diseases known to be caused by smoking) and the controls (never smokers). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to estimate relative risks, RR (odds ratios) for smoking-attributed mortality, for lung cancer and all causes of death related to smoking, adjusted for 5-year interval age groups, education, marital status, and year of death. Results: During the study period (2010-15), the annual crude death reporting rates ranged from 6.5‰ to 7.0‰. The reporting rates of smoking status, smoking history and the number of cigarettes smoked daily were 95.5%, 98.6% and 98.6%, respectively. Compared to never smokers, the RR of ever smoking in males was 1.38 (95% CI: 1.33-1.43) for all causes of smoking-related deaths and 3.07 (95% CI: 2.91-3.24) for lung cancer, while in females the values were 1.46 (95% CI: 1.39-1.54) for all causes of smoking-related deaths and 4.07 (95% CI: 3.81-4.35) for lung cancer.

Methods: In a nationally representative sample of 1.1 million homes, we compared the prevalence of smoking among 33,000 deceased women and 41,000 deceased men (case subjects) with the prevalence of smoking among 35,000 living women and 43,000 living men (unmatched control subjects). Mortality risk ratios comparing smokers with nonsmokers were adjusted for age, educational level, and use of alcohol. Results: About 5% of female control subjects and 37% of male control subjects between the ages of 30 and 69 years were smokers. In this age group, smoking was associated with an increased risk of death from any medical cause among both women (risk ratio, 2.0; 99% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 2.3) and men (risk ratio, 1.7; 99% CI, 1.6 to 1.8). Daily smoking of even a small amount of tobacco was associated with increased mortality. Excess deaths among smokers, as compared with nonsmokers, were chiefly from tuberculosis among both women (risk ratio, 3.0; 99% CI, 2.4 to 3.9) and men (risk ratio, 2.3; 99% CI, 2.1 to 2.6) and from respiratory, vascular, or neoplastic disease. Smoking was associated with a reduction in median survival of 8 years for women (99% CI, 5 to 11) and 6 years for men (99% CI, 5 to 7). If these associations are mainly causal, smoking in persons between the ages of 30 and 69 years is responsible for about 1 in 20 deaths of women and 1 in 5 deaths of men. In 2010, smoking will cause about 930,000 adult deaths in India; of the dead, about 70% (90,000 women and 580,000 men) will be between the ages of 30 and 69 years.

The tobacco industry has criticized the surgeon general's estimates because they do not control for the lower educational and socioeconomic status of modern-day smokers. Objective: To determine whether controlling for education, occupation, race, alcohol consumption, and various dietary factors, in addition to age and sex, substantially alters the relative and attributable risk estimates associated with tobacco smoking. Design, setting, and participants: Nationwide American Cancer Society prospective cohort study of 974, 150 US adults aged 30 years or older, enrolled in 1982 and followed up through 1988. (The same study is used for the surgeon general and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] estimates of smoking-attributable deaths in the United States.) Main outcome measures: Death from each of the chronic diseases considered in the CDC's estimate of smoking-attributable mortality (cancers of the lung, oropharynx, larynx, esophagus, pancreas, kidney, bladder, and cervix; ischemic heart disease, arterial disease, and other heart conditions; stroke; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and other respiratory conditions). Estimates adjusted for multiple covariates were compared with those adjusted for age only among current and former vs never smokers. Results: Adjusting for multiple covariates slightly decreased the relative and attributable risk estimates for current smoking in both men and women, but slightly increased the estimates for former smoking in women. Multivariate adjustment decreased the overall estimate of deaths attributable to smoking in the United States by approximately 1%, from 401,109 to 396,741 per year. Conclusions: Our study suggests that federal estimates of deaths caused by smoking are not substantially altered by adjustment for behavioral and demographic factors associated with smoking beyond the current adjustment for age and sex.

Additionally, cigarette smoking is a direct cause of ischaemic heart disease (the commonest cause of death in western countries), respiratory heart disease, aortic aneurysm, chronic obstructive lung disease, stroke, pneumonia and cirrhosis and cancer of the liver. Cigarette smoking can kill in 24 different ways and, although smoking protects against several fatal and non-fatal conditions, the adverse effect of smoking on health is largely negative. In developed countries as a whole, tobacco is responsible for 24% of all male deaths and 7% of all female deaths: these figures rise to over 40% in men in some countries of central and eastern Europe and to 17% in women in the United States. The average loss of life of smokers is 8 years. Among United Kingdom doctors followed for 40 years, overall death rates in middle age were about three times higher among doctors who smoked cigarettes as among doctors who had never smoked regularly. About half of all regular cigarette smokers will eventually be killed by their habit. The important information is that it is never too late to stop smoking: among United Kingdom doctors who stopped smoking, even in middle age, there was a substantial improvement in life expectancy. World-wide, smoking is killing three million people each year and this figure is increasing. In most countries the worst is yet to come, since by the time the young smokers of today reach middle or old age there will be about 10 million deaths/year from tobacco. Approximately 500 million individuals alive today can expect to be killed by tobacco, 250 million of these deaths will occur in middle age. Tobacco is already the biggest cause of adult death in developed countries. Over the next few decades tobacco could well become the biggest cause of adult death in the world. For men in developed countries, the full effects of smoking can already be seen. Tobacco now causes one-third of all male deaths in middle age (plus one fifth in old age). Tobacco is a cause of about half of all male cancer deaths in middle age (plus one-third in old age). Of those who start smoking in their teenage years and keep on smoking, about half will be killed by tobacco. Half of these deaths will be in middle age (35-69) and each will lose an average of 20-25 years of non-smoker life expectancy. In non-smokers in many countries, cancer mortality is decreasing slowly and total mortality rapidly. The war against cancer is being won slowly: the effects of cigarette smoking are holding back this victory. Lung cancer now kills more women in the United States each year than breast cancer. For women in developed countries, the peak of the tobacco epidemic has not yet arrived. Tobacco now causes almost one-third of all deaths in women in middle age in the United States. Although it has only 5% of the world's female population, the United States has 50% of the world's deaths from smoking in women. Tobacco smoking is a major cause of premature death. Throughout Europe, in 1990 tobacco smoking caused three quarters of a million deaths in middle age (between 35 and 69). In the Member States of the European Union in 1990 there were over one quarter of a million deaths in middle age directly caused by tobacco smoking: there were 219700 in men and 31900 in women. There were many more deaths caused by tobacco at older ages. In countries of central and eastern Europe, including the former USSR, there were 441200 deaths in middle age in men and 42100 deaths in women. There is a need for urgent action to help contain this important and unnecessary loss of life.

As the smoking epidemic progresses, updates on the development of mortality inequalities attributable to smoking are needed. We provide estimates of relative and absolute educational inequalities in mortality from lung cancer, aerodigestive cancers, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma in Europe and assess the contribution of these smoking-related diseases to inequalities in all-cause mortality. Methods: We use data from 18 European populations covering the time period 1998-2007. We present age-adjusted mortality rates, relative indices of inequality, and slope indices of inequality. We also calculate the contribution of inequalities in smoking-related mortality to inequalities in overall mortality. Results: Among men, relative inequalities in mortality from the 3 smoking-related causes of death combined are largest in the Czech Republic and Hungary and smallest in Spain, Sweden, and Denmark. Among women, these inequalities are largest in Scotland and Norway and smallest in Italy and Spain. They are often larger among men and tend to be larger for COPD/asthma than for lung and aerodigestive cancers. Relative inequalities in mortality from these conditions are often larger in younger age groups, particularly among women, suggesting a possible further widening of inequalities in mortality in the coming decades. The combined contribution of these diseases to inequality in all-cause mortality varies between 13% and 32% among men and between -5% and 30% among women.

In addition to a strong association with a number of systemic diseases, smoking is also associated with many dermatological conditions, including poor wound healing, premature skin aging, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, oral cancer, acne, psoriasis, and hair loss. This review focuses on the effects of smoking on premature skin aging. It has been long established that smoking has deleterious effects on skin. Epidemiological studies indicate that smoking is an important environmental factor in premature skin aging. In vitro studies indicate that tobacco smoke extract impairs the production of collagen and increases the production of tropoelastin and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), which degrade matrix proteins, and also causes an abnormal production of elastosis material. Smoking increases MMP levels, which leads to the degradation of collagen, elastic fibers, and proteoglycans, suggesting an imbalance between biosynthesis and degradation in dermal connective tissue metabolism. Reactive oxygen species are also involved in tobacco smoke-induced premature skin aging. Scavengers of reactive oxygen species ameliorate the induction of MMP. Tobacco smoke extract also impacts dermal connective tissue in nude mice. Thus, in vitro and in vivo evidence indicates that smoking tobacco leads to accelerated aging of the skin. These findings might be useful to motivate those patients who are more concerned about their appearance than the potential internal damage associated with smoking to stop smoking.",0.3835221827030182

It is important for clinicians and patients to be aware of the symptoms of these conditions as well as the most beneficial approaches for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management. The life expectancy of women has increased and predictions for the year 2050 estimate the average age at 81 years. This will place women at greater risk for dermatological problems, especially photodamage and skin cancer. In addition, various ethnic groups may manifest these conditions differently. Although acne is most prevalent among teenaged males, most can expect clearing by age 25. Females may continue to experience acne into the adult years, sometimes beyond the age of 40. Although it is not a life-threatening disease, acne may have psychosocial and quality-of-life consequences. Treatments for acne can be topical or systemic, and include retinoids, antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and hormonal therapy. Rosacea is more common in women (especially during menopause) than in men. It is a chronic condition that can cause complications, including telangiectasia, conjunctivitis, and blepharitis. Although there is no cure, rosacea can be managed and controlled with medication. Topical antibiotics, such as metronidazole, and systemic antibiotics, such as tetracycline, clarithromycin, and doxycycline, are used to manage rosacea. Striae, or stretch marks, occur most frequently in pregnant women, adolescents experiencing growth spurts, weight lifters, and the obese. Although not a health threat, they can be psychologically distressing. There are not many treatment options for striae, but topical tretinoin and the pulsed dye laser offer promising results. Intrinsic, or normal, aging of the skin results from the process of chronological aging. Photodamage is skin damage caused by chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. It is the leading cause of extrinsic aging, or alterations of the skin due to environmental exposure. Estimates indicate that almost half of a person's UV exposure occurs by age 18. Photoaging causes numerous histologic, physiologic, and clinical changes; it also increases the risk for skin cancer. Photodamage can be prevented through the use of sun screens, protective clothing, and avoidance of the sun during peak intensity time. The only product approved by the FDA for the treatment of photodamage (fine wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, and skin roughness), topical tretinoin emollient cream, may help prevent additional photoaging when it is used to treat existing photoaging. Other management options for photodamaged skin include alpha-hydroxy acids, antioxidants, antiandrogens, moisturizers, and exfoliants. In patients with excessive manifestations of photodamage, surgical management may be needed, including dermabrasion, chemical peels, soft tissue augmentation, laser resurfacing, botulism toxin, and Gortex threads.

2_h,health_belief,15492432,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"Skin aging appears to be the result of both scheduled and continuous ""wear and tear"" processes that damage cellular DNA and proteins. Two types of aging, chronological skin aging and photoaging, have distinct clinical and histological features. Chronological skin aging is a universal and inevitable process characterized primarily by physiologic alterations in skin function. In this case, keratinocytes are unable to properly terminally differentiate to form a functional stratum corneum, and the rate of formation of neutral lipids that contribute to the barrier function slows, causing dry, pale skin with fine wrinkles. In contrast, photoaging results from the UVR of sunlight and the damage thus becomes apparent in sun-exposed skin.

2_h,health_belief,27224842,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"First described in the context of diabetes, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed through a type of non-enzymatic reaction called glycation. Increased accumulation of AGEs in human tissue has now been associated with end stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and, recently, skin aging. Characteristic findings of aging skin, including decreased resistance to mechanical stress, impaired wound healing, and distorted dermal vasculature, can be in part attributable to glycation. Multiple factors mediate cutaneous senescence, and these factors are generally characterized as endogenous (e.g., telomere shortening) or exogenous (e.g., ultraviolet radiation exposure). Interestingly, AGEs exert their pathophysiological effects from both endogenous and exogenous routes. The former entails the consumption of sugar in the diet, which then covalently binds an electron from a donor molecule to form an AGE. The latter process mostly refers to the formation of AGEs through cooking. Recent studies have revealed that certain methods of food preparation (i.e., grilling, frying, and roasting) produce much higher levels of AGEs than water-based cooking methods such as boiling and steaming. Moreover, several dietary compounds have emerged as promising candidates for the inhibition of glycation-mediated aging. In this review, we summarize the evidence supporting the critical role of glycation in skin aging and highlight preliminary studies on dietary strategies that may be able to combat this process.",0.40752631425857544

Oxidative damage occurs because of both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Together, intrinsic and extrinsic damage are the primary causes of skin aging. The skin uses a series of intrinsic antioxidants to protect itself from free radical damage. Naturally occurring extrinsic antioxidants have also been widely shown to offset and alleviate these changes. Unlike sunscreens, which have an SPF rating system to guide consumers in their purchases, there is no widely accepted method to choose antioxidant anti-aging products. ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) and ABEL-RAC (Analysis By Emitted Light-Relative Antioxidant Capacity), are both accepted worldwide as a standard measure of the antioxidant capacity of foods, and are rating systems that could be applied to all antioxidant skincare products.

One method for skin rejuvenation adopted a high-temperature plasma generator to remove skin epithelial cells. In this case, the catalyzing effects of the plasma were rarely used due to the high temperature. Hence, the benefits of the plasma were not magnified. Recently, many types of low-temperature plasma devices have been developed for medical applications but their detailed functions and working mechanisms are unclear. The present study examined the effect of low-temperature microwave plasma on skin cells. Treatment with low-temperature plasma increased the expression of anti-aging genes in skin cells, including collagen, fibronectin and vascular endothelial growth factor. Furthermore, the plasma treatment did not cause cell death, but only induced slight cell growth arrest at the G2 phase. Although the cells treated with low-temperature plasma showed moderate growth arrest, there were no signs of thermal or genetic damage of skin cells. Overall, this low-temperature microwave plasma device induces the expressions of some anti-aging-related genes in skin cells without causing damage.",0.1768828183412552

3_h,health_belief,29876931,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"To ensure their high proliferation rate, tumor cells have an iron metabolic disorder causing them to have increased iron needs, making them more susceptible to iron deprivation. This vulnerability could be a therapeutic target. In breast cancers, the development of new therapeutic approaches is urgently needed for patients with triple-negative tumors, which frequently relapse after chemotherapy and suffer from a lack of targeted therapies. In this study, we demonstrated that deferasirox (DFX) synergises with standard chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin, cisplatin and carboplatin to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis and autophagy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Moreover, the combination of DFX with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide delayed recurrences in breast cancer patient-derived xenografts without increasing the side-effects of chemotherapies alone or altering the global iron storage of mice. Antitumor synergy of DFX and doxorubicin seems to involve downregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and nuclear factor-κB pathways. Iron deprivation in combination with chemotherapy could thus help to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy in TNBC patients without increasing toxicity.

In this study, we assessed the additional predictive value of the 70-gene MammaPrint signature for chemotherapy (CT) benefit in addition to endocrine therapy (ET) from pooled study series. For 541 patients who received either ET (n = 315) or ET + CT (n = 226), breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and distant disease-free survival (DDFS) at 5 years were assessed separately for the 70-gene high and low risk groups. The 70-gene signature classified 252 patients (47%) as low risk and 289 (53%) as high risk. Within the 70-gene low risk group, BCSS was 97% for the ET group and 99% for the ET + CT group at 5 years with a non-significant univariate hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 (95% CI 0.07-4.98; P = 0.62). In the 70-gene high risk group, BCSS was 81% (ET group) and 94% (ET + CT group) at 5 years with a significant HR of 0.21 (95% CI 0.07-0.59; P 0.01).

We determined whether characteristics of neoadjuvant therapy are associated with pCR. We used multi-level models, which accounted for heterogeneity in pCR across trials and trial arms, to analyze individual patient data from 3332 women included in 7 German neoadjuvant trials with uniform protocols. PCR was associated with an increase in number of chemotherapy cycles (odds ratio [OR] 1.2 for every two additional cycles; P = 0.009), with higher cumulative anthracycline doses (OR 1.6; P = 0.002), higher cumulative taxane doses (OR 1.6; P = 0.009), and with capecitabine containing regimens (OR 1.62; P = 0.022). Association of pCR with increase in number of cycles appeared more pronounced in hormone receptor (HR)-positive tumors (OR 1.35) than in HR-negative tumors (OR 1.04; P for interaction = 0.046). Effect of anthracycline dose was particularly pronounced in HER2-negative tumors (OR 1.61), compared to HER2-positive tumors (OR 0.83; P for interaction = 0.14). Simultaneous trastuzumab treatment in HER2-positive tumors increased odds of pCR 3.2-fold (P 0.001). No association of pCR and number of trastuzumab cycles was found (OR 1.20, P = 0.39). Dosing characteristics appear important for successful treatment of breast cancer. Longer treatment, higher cumulative doses of anthracyclines and taxanes, and the addition of capecitabine and trastuzumab are associated with better response. Tailoring according to breast cancer phenotype might be possible: longer treatment in HR-positive tumors, higher cumulative anthracycline doses for HER2-negative tumors, shorter treatment at higher cumulative doses for triple-negative tumors, and limited number of preoperative trastuzumab cycles in HER2-positive tumors.",0.22866509854793549

The multicenter I-SPY 1 TRIAL evaluated patients with ≥ 3 cm tumors by using early imaging and molecular signatures, with outcomes of pathologic complete response (pCR) and RFS. The current analysis was performed using data from patients who had molecular profiles and did not receive trastuzumab. The various molecular classifiers tested were highly correlated. Categorization of breast cancer by molecular signatures enhanced the ability of pCR to predict improvement in RFS compared to the population as a whole. In multivariate analysis, the molecular signatures that added to the ability of HR and HER2 receptors, clinical stage, and pCR in predicting RFS included 70-gene signature, wound healing signature, p53 mutation signature, and PAM50 risk of recurrence. The low risk signatures were associated with significantly better prognosis, and also identified additional patients with a good prognosis within the no pCR group, primarily in the hormone receptor positive, HER-2 negative subgroup. The I-SPY 1 population is enriched for tumors with a poor prognosis but is still heterogeneous in terms of rates of pCR and RFS.

Participants were randomized to usual care (UC) (n = 70), AET (n = 64), or RET (n = 66) for the duration of chemotherapy. Measures of sarcopenia [skeletal muscle index (SMI)] and dynapenia [upper extremity (UE) and lower extremity (LE) muscle dysfunction (MD)] were normalized relative to age-/sex-based clinical cut-points. QoL was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) scales. At baseline, 25.5 % of BC patients were sarcopenic and 54.5 % were dynapenic with both conditions associated with poorer QoL. ANCOVAs showed significant differences favoring RET over UC for SMI (0.32 kg/m(2); p = 0.017), UE-MD (0.12 kg/kg; p 0.001), and LE-MD (0.27 kg/kg; p 0.001). Chi-square analyses revealed significant effects of RET, compared to UC/AET combined, on reversing sarcopenia (p = 0.039) and dynapenia (p = 0.019). The reversal of sarcopenia was associated with clinically relevant improvements in the FACT-An (11.7 points [95 % confidence interval (CI) -4.2 to 27.6]), the Trial Outcome Index-Anemia (10.0 points [95 % CI -4.0 to 24.1]), and fatigue (5.3 points [95 % CI -1.5 to 12.1]).

Here we report the first prospective MRI study of women undergoing treatment for breast cancer, with or without chemotherapy, as well as healthy controls. We hypothesized that chemotherapy-associated changes in gray matter density would be detectable 1 month after treatment, with partial recovery 1 year later. Participants included breast cancer patients treated with (CTx+, N = 17) or without (CTx-, N = 12) chemotherapy and matched healthy controls (N = 18). MRI scans were acquired at baseline (after surgery but before radiation, chemotherapy, and/or anti-estrogen treatment), 1 month after completion of chemotherapy (M1), and 1 year later (Y1). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to evaluate gray matter density differences between groups and over time. There were no between-group gray matter differences at baseline. Group-by-time interactions showed declines from baseline to M1 in both cancer groups relative to controls. Within-group analyses indicated that at M1 relative to baseline the CTx+ group had decreased gray matter density in bilateral frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions and right thalamus. Recovery was seen at Y1 in some regions, although persistent decreases were also apparent. No significant within-group changes were found in the CTx- or control groups. Findings were not attributable to recency of cancer surgery, disease stage, psychiatric symptoms, psychotropic medication use, or hormonal treatment status. This study is the first to use a prospective, longitudinal approach to document decreased brain gray matter density shortly after breast cancer chemotherapy and its course of recovery over time.

To investigate this issue further, we examined the characteristics and correlates of sexual functioning in women diagnosed with breast cancer at least 5 years previously and treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and in an age-matched comparison group of women with no history of cancer. Patients and methods: Participants were 58 women initially diagnosed with breast cancer at an average of 7.65 years previously and 61 women with no history of cancer. All participants completed standardized self-report measures of sexual functioning, marital functioning, depression, fatigue, and menopausal symptoms. Results: Compared with women with no history of cancer, long-term breast cancer survivors reported worse sexual functioning (P or = 0.01), characterized by greater lack of sexual interest, inability to relax and enjoy sex, difficulty becoming aroused, and difficulty achieving an orgasm. Additional analyses indicated that severity of vaginal dryness was significantly (P or = 0.05) related to poorer sexual functioning among long-term breast cancer survivors and mediated the relationship between group membership (breast cancer survivor v.s. noncancer comparison subject) and sexual functioning.

We aimed to determine CIPN prevalence, risk factors, and association with psychological distress and falls among long-term breast cancer survivors. We conducted Cross-sectional analyses among postmenopausal women with a history of stage I-III breast cancer who received taxane-based chemotherapy. Participants reported neuropathic symptoms of tingling/numbness in hands and/or feet on a 0-10 numerical rating scale. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to evaluate risk factors associated with the presence of CIPN and the relationship between CIPN and anxiety, depression, insomnia, and patient-reported falls. Among 296 participants, 173 (58.4 %) reported CIPN symptoms, 91 (30.7 %) rated their symptoms as mild, and 82 (27.7 %) rated them moderate to severe. Compared with women of normal weight, being obese was associated with increased risk of CIPN (adjusted OR 1.94, 95 % CI: 1.03-3.65). Patients with CIPN reported greater insomnia severity, anxiety, and depression than those without (all p 0.05).

In this study we evaluated the oxidative systemic status and hematological profiles of breast cancer patients with advanced ductal infiltrative carcinoma treated with doxorubicin (DOX) or paclitaxel (PTX) within 1 h after chemotherapy. Blood analyses included evaluation of hemogram, pro-oxidative markers, and antioxidant status. The results showed that advanced breast cancer diseased (AD) patients without previous chemotherapy presented anemia and high oxidative stress status characterized by elevated levels of lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide, and reduced catalase activity when compared with controls. DOX-treated patients exhibited increased anemia and reduced antioxidant status, which was revealed by decreases in reduced glutathione levels and the total antioxidant capacity of plasma; however, these changes did not lead to further increases in lipid peroxidation or carbonyl proteins when compared with the AD group. PTX-treated patients also showed increased anemia, lactate dehydrogenase leakage, and enhanced lipid peroxidation. These data reveal for the first time that patients subjected to chemotherapy with DOX or PTX present immediate systemic oxidative stress and red blood cell oxidative injury with anemia development.

These occur during the course of treatment and generally resolve within months of completion of chemotherapy. A variety of Chinese medicinal herbs have been used for managing these side effects. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs in alleviating chemotherapy-induced short term side effects in breast cancer patients. Search strategy: We searched The Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register (15/02/2007), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1966 to December 2006); EMBASE (1990 to December 2006); and Chinese Biomedical Literature (2006, Issue 4). A number of journals were hand searched. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing chemotherapy with or without Chinese herbs in women with breast cancer. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted the data, which were analysed using RevMan 4.2. For dichotomous data, we estimated the relative risk. For continuous data, we calculated the weighted mean difference. Main results: We identified seven randomised controlled trials involving 542 breast cancer patients undergoing or having recently undergone chemotherapy. All studies were conducted and published in China. We did not pool the results because few studies were identified and no more than two used the same intervention. All were of low quality and used CMH plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone.CMH combined with chemotherapy showed no statistically significant difference for the outcomes of phlebitis and alopecia. Only one study showed an improvement in nausea and vomiting, and in fatigue. Three indicated an improvement in white blood cells in the group receiving CMH. Two showed an increase in percentage changes in T-lymphocyte subsets CD4 and CD8. One study showed a statistically significant difference for CMH in percentage changes in T-lymphocyte subsets CD3, CD4 and CD8. Two herbal compounds may have improved quality of life. One study reported that CMH may have some effect on reducing toxicity in liver and kidney, but differences were not statistically significant. Authors' conclusions: This review provides limited evidence about the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs in alleviating chemotherapy induced short term side effects. Chinese medicinal herbs, when used together with chemotherapy, may offer some benefit to breast cancer patients in terms of bone marrow improvement and quality of life, but the evidence is too limited to make any confident conclusions.

Design: UK media articles were searched for articles relating to oral cancer and HPV in the database NexisUK. Of 854 articles identified by the initial search, 112 were eligible for inclusion (2002-2014) and content analysis was used to determine the main themes discussed. Results: Themes included actor Michael Douglas' claim that his throat cancer was caused by HPV, the riskiness of oral sex, health information (including HPV as a cause of oral cancer) and the need to vaccinate boys against HPV. Many articles also referred to the link between HPV and cervical cancer and the increasing incidence of HPV-related oral cancer. The largest peak in articles occurred when Michael Douglas discussed his cancer (June 2013). Facts about HPV and references to research were provided in some articles.

Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we identified observational and interventional studies reporting associations between several different sexual behaviours and OPC or OCC. Study quality was assessed independently by two reviewers using a validated scoring system. Results: From 513 papers identified, 21, reporting on 20 studies, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two cohort studies were rated as moderate quality. The 18 case-control studies were rated as weak; nine comparing people with OPC or OCC to people without cancer, eight comparing HPV-positive to HPV-negative cancer patients and one comparing OPCs to other head and neck cancers. One study was a pooled analysis of seven of the included studies with some additional information. Twelve sexual behaviours were assessed and 69 associations reported. The studies differed in the comparisons made, the sexual behaviours assessed, and how these were reported and categorized, so no quantitative meta-analyses were appropriate. Most studies combined OPC and OCC. Several significantly increased risks were seen with a high number of lifetime sexual partners (nine studies) and with the practice of oral sex (five studies), although two studies found a significant negative association with OCC and ever performing oral sex. Two cohort studies of men and women in homosexual relationships found increases in oral cancer risk, and a cohort study of men married to women who had a history of cervical cancer also showed an increased risk of oral cancers. Results for other sexual behaviours were limited and inconsistent, and these included the following: younger age at first sexual intercourse, number of lifetime oral sex partners, the practice of oral-anal sex, the number of oral-anal sex partners, and ever performing anal sex. Only one study assessed casual sex, never or rare use of a condom and having a sexual partner with a history of genital warts, finding significant associations in the two former behaviours. Conclusion: The current evidence for sexual behaviours being risk factors for oral and oropharyngeal cancer is limited and inconsistent. Evidence suggests that the number of sexual partners and performing oral sex are associated with a greater risk. Furthermore men whose partners have had cervical cancer may have an increased risk. More studies looking at OPC specifically will be useful to determine whether these behaviours are subsite-selective.",0.24035941064357758

Although there has been an overall decline in the incidence of head and neck cancers over the past 25 years, there has been a shift in the distribution of these cancers toward a particular type known as oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs), and a younger demographic. These particular cancers, OSCCs, have been shown to be associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Several researchers have suggested that this shift in the epidemiology of head and neck cancers might be attributable to changing sexual practices. While this speculation has caught on in the popular press, there are several interesting contradictions in the existing evidence that suggest this conclusion might be premature and overreached. Aim: The intent of this article is to help clarify the issues so that sexual medicine professionals can give accurate and up-to-date information to their patients. Main outcome measures: This is a review article; no outcome data are reported. This is a review article; no measures were collected. Methods: Pubmed search on HPV, oral sex, oral cancers, and OSCCs. Results: One hundred ninety-six articles on HPV were found; 63 articles on oral sex, 55 on oral cancer, and 5 articles on OSCCs were identified as relevant. Conclusions: HPV infections occur commonly and are usually cleared within 18 months, thus HPV infection should not be a cause for concern among monogamous couples with a rich and varied sex life as long as the sexual system remains closed and other immune compromising factors are not present. HPV becomes a concern in the context of immune system compromise and infection persistence. Factors contributing to immune system compromise, HPV persistence, and oncogenesis are reviewed.",0.2522825598716736

Results: ORs were increased in underweight ( 18.5 BMI) relative to normal weight (18.5-24.9) and reduced in overweight and obese categories (≥ 25 BMI) for all sites and were homogeneous by sex. ORs by smoking and drinking in women compared with men were significantly greater for oropharyngeal cancer (p 0.01 for both factors), suggestive for hypopharyngeal cancer (p = 0.05 and p = 0.06, respectively), but homogeneous for oral cavity (p = 0.56 and p = 0.64) and laryngeal (p = 0.18 and p = 0.72) cancers. Conclusions: The extent that OR modifications of smoking and drinking by sex for oropharyngeal and, possibly, hypopharyngeal cancers represent true associations, or derive from unmeasured confounders or unobserved sex-related disease subtypes (e.g., human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal cancer) remains to be clarified.",0.09488131105899811

We studied 200 cases of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, of whom 57 women (median age = 64) and 200 hospital controls, frequency matched with cases by age and sex, in relation to smoking and drinking history, intake of 25 foods or food groups, indicators of oral hygiene and sexual activity, and history of sexually transmitted diseases. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained from unconditional multiple logistic regressions and adjusted for age, sex, area of residence, education, and smoking and drinking habits. In the multivariate model, high educational level and white-collar occupation, but not white race, were associated with halving of oral cancer risk. Smoking &gt; or =30 cigarettes per day showed an OR of 20.8 (95% CI: 8.9-48.3), similar to smoking &gt; or =4 cigars daily (OR = 20.5). Drinking &gt; or = 70 alcoholic drinks per week showed an OR of 5.7 (95% CI: 1.8-18.5). Hard liquors were by far the largest source of alcohol. Increased risk was associated with the highest tertile of intake for maize (OR = 1.9), meat (OR = 2.2) and ham and salami (OR = 2.0), whereas high fruit intake was associated with significantly decreased risk (OR = 0.4). Among indicators of dental care, number of missing teeth and poor general oral condition at oral inspection showed ORs of 2.7 and 2.6, respectively. Number of sexual partners, marriages or contacts with prostitutes, practice of oral sex and history of various sexually transmitted diseases, including genital warts, were not associated with oral cancer risk. 82% of oral cancer cases in Cuba were attributable to tobacco smoking, 19% to smoking cigars or pipe only. The fractions attributable to alcohol drinking (7%) and low fruit intake (11%) were more modest. Thus, decreases in cigarette and cigar smoking are at present the key to oral cancer prevention in Cuba.",0.14634692668914795

Therefore, we compared the sexual behavior of patients with Barrett's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma and controls (hospital, reflux, and Barrett's metaplasia) to explore a plausible mechanism of viral transmission to the lower esophagus. A hospital-based case-control study involving 36 Barrett's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma subjects and 55 controls with known HPV DNA status and markers of transcriptional activity i.e p16INK4A and E6/E7 mRNA of the esophageal epithelium was conducted to evaluate differences in sexual history (if any). Barrett's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma patients were more likely than controls to be positive for HPV DNA (18 of 36, 50% vs. 6/55, 11%, p for trend 0.0001), be male (P = 0.001) and in a relationship (P = 0.02). Viral genotypes identified were HPV 16 (n = 14), 18 (n = 2), 11 (n = 1) and 6 (n = 1). HPV exposure conferred a significantly higher risk for Barrett's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma as compared with hospital/reflux/Barrett's metaplasia controls (OR = 6.8, 95% CI: 2.1-23.1, adjusted P = 0.002). On univariate analysis, ≥6 lifetime oral sex partners were significantly associated with dysplastic Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma (OR, 4.0; 95% CI: 1.2-13.7, P = 0.046). After adjustment for confounders, HPV exposure and men with ≥2 lifetime sexual partners were at significant risk for Barrett's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma.

The purpose of the current study was to further investigate whether the annual UVR level, estimated on a county level, is associated with incidence rates of such cancers using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 data. If UVR exposure is associated with incidence of these cancer types, we would expect to see a similar or stronger association with melanoma because UVR exposure is a well-demonstrated risk factor for this disease. Thus, we also included melanoma in the study. Materials and methods: The study subjects were White and Black individuals with oral, pharyngeal, cervical cancer or melanoma diagnosed between 1973 and 2011 from the SEER 18 data. UVR was estimated at the county level and grouped into high-, medium- and low-exposure levels. Age-adjusted incidence rates of cancer were calculated and compared among the UVR exposure groups. The comparisons were also stratified by sex and race. Results: There was an inverse association between UVR exposure and incidence of oral, pharyngeal, and cervical cancer. The inverse association was also observed for melanoma. When stratified by race and sex, the inverse associations remained except for melanoma among Blacks. Conclusion: In contrast to a previous study, our study found that there were inverse associations between UVR exposure and the incidence of oral, pharyngeal, and cervical cancer, as well as of melanoma. Our findings are in agreement with several other published studies reporting no positive correlation between UVR exposure and the incidence rates of oral, pharyngeal, and cervical cancer and melanoma.",0.1089537963271141

Aims: To assess the levels of vitamin A, vitamin C and zinc in laryngeal cancer patients and healthy controls. Setting and design: A hospital based case- control study. Material and methods: One hundred and fifty five laryngeal cancer patients and a control group of 155 healthy individuals constituted the study population. Individuals in the control group were individually matched with the patients for their age +/- 2 years, sex and place of residence. Venous blood was drawn from the cases and controls and estimations of vitamin A, zinc and vitamin C was done utilizing the standard procedures. Statistical analysis used: Paired 't' test to compare the mean serum levels of vitamin A and zinc and plasma vitamin C between laryngeal cancer patients and controls. Univariate logistic regression analysis to calculate the odds ratios and the confidence intervals.

The most common smokeless tobaccos are chewing tobacco, naswar, snuff, snus, gutka, and topical tobacco paste. Any product which contains tobacco is not safe for human health. There are more than twenty-five compounds in smokeless tobacco which have cancer causing activity. Use of smokeless tobacco has been linked with risk of oral cancer. Smokeless tobacco contains tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), polonium, formaldehyde, cadmium, lead, and benzo[a]pyrene, which are carcinogenic agents. Although there is presence of some compounds, carotenoids and phenolic compounds, that have cancer inhibiting properties, they are in low concentrations. Dry snuff use is linked with higher relative risks, while the use of other smokeless tobacco is of intermediate risk. Moist snuff and chewing tobacco have a very low risk for oral cancer. Therefore, from this review article, it was concluded that smokeless tobacco has risk for oral cancer - either low, medium or high depending on the balance between cancer causing agents and cancer inhibiting agents.",0.5330753922462463

In addition to smoking, tobacco chewing may be a major risk factor for some of these cancers in India. Using data from a multicentric case-control study conducted in India that included 513 hypopharyngeal cancer cases, 511 laryngeal cancer cases and 718 controls, we investigated smoking and chewing tobacco products as risk factors for these cancers. Bidi smoking was a stronger risk factor compared to cigarette smoking for cancer of the hypopharynx (OR(bidi) 6.80 vs. OR(cig) 3.82) and supraglottis (OR(bidi) 7.53 vs. OR(cig) 2.14), while the effect of the 2 products was similar for cancer of the glottis (OR(bidi) 5.32 vs. OR(cig) 5.74). Among never-smokers, tobacco chewing was a risk factor for hypopharyngeal cancer, but not for laryngeal cancer. In particular, the risk of hypopharyngeal cancer increased with the use of Khaini (OR 2.02, CI 0.81-5.05), Mawa (OR 3.17, CI 1.06-9.53), Pan (OR 3.34, CI 1.68-6.61), Zarda (OR 3.58, CI 1.20-10.68) and Gutkha (OR 4.59, CI 1.21-17.49).

While cigarette smoking may be associated with breast cancer, smokeless tobacco use has never been evaluated as a breast cancer risk factor. This study explores such an association. Methods: A complete census was carried out among Eastern Band Cherokee women aged 18 years and older, residing on tribal lands in western North Carolina. Self-reported alcohol, cigarette and smokeless tobacco use, demographic information, and personal history of breast cancer (stratified by age of onset 55 years or &gt; or = 55 years) were obtained by questionnaire. Results: 1,070 out of 1,408 (76%) eligible women were interviewed. Current and former smokeless tobacco use was common (6% and 21%, respectively). Five cases of breast cancer were identified in women under the age of 55 years and 3 cases were found in women at &gt; or = 55 years. Only the odds ratio (OR) for younger-onset breast cancer among ever-users of smokeless tobacco was significantly elevated (OR = 7.79, 95% CI = 1.05-66.0).

No ORs were significantly elevated for breast cancer among older women. Conclusions: These preliminary data are the first to document an apparent relationship between smokeless tobacco use and breast cancer risk, but should be confirmed in other studies due to the small number of cases.

We then reviewed the scientific literature to determine whether these claims were substantiated. Results: Only for oral leukoplakia and several oral conditions is the evidence persuasive for causation by ST. The evidence that ST causes oral cancer is very suggestive, whereas the evidence for causation of other cancers is either absent or contradictory. Conclusions: Communication of the health risks of using ST must be done accurately and should be data based.

The Indian data suggest that oral cancer and precancerous lesions occur almost solely among those with tobacco habits, the rate of malignant transformation of precancerous lesions is not greater than in the West, the relative risk of developing oral cancer is similar in India and in the US, and this risk rises with duration of use.

However, the potential of smokeless tobacco products associated bacteriome to manipulate systemic inflammation and other signaling pathways involved in the etiology of oral cancer will be a risk factor for oral cancer. Further, damage to oral epithelial cells causes a leaky oral layer that leads to increased infiltration of bacterial components like lipopolysaccharide, flagellin, and toxins, etc. The consumption of smokeless tobacco products can cause damage to the oral layer and dysbiosis of oral microbiota. Hence, the enrichment of harmful microbes due to dysbiosis in the oral cavity can produce high levels of bacterial metabolites and provoke inflammation as well as carcinogenesis. Understanding the complex and dynamic interrelation between the smokeless tobacco-linked bacteriome and host oral microbiome may help to unravel the mechanism of oral carcinogenesis stimulated by smokeless tobacco products.

Subjects were further stratified by cigarette smoking status in order to differentiate 'exclusive' ST users (n=414) from never tobacco users (n=2,979).

No synergistic effect was observed between ST and cigarette smoking among male combined users (females were not analyzed for combined use) for the major cancers. Conclusions: In contrast to the well-known deleterious effects of cigarette smoking, ST use did not substantially increase the risk for cancer incidence above that of non-tobacco users, particularly among males. Although the use of tobacco in any form is to be discouraged, our data suggests that cancer risks are much lower from ST use than from cigarette smoking.",0.04887841269373894

Method: A review of the literature suggesting potential depressogenic effects of long-term treatment with antidepressant drugs was performed. A MEDLINE search was conducted using the keywords tolerance, sensitization, antidepressive agents, and switching. This was supplemented by a manual search of Index Medicus under the heading ""antidepressant agents"" and a manual search of the literature for articles pointing to paradoxical effects of antidepressants. Results: A number of reported clinical findings point to the following possibilities: very unfavorable long-term outcome of major depression treated by pharmacologic means, paradoxical (depression-inducing) effects of antidepressant drugs in some patients with mood and anxiety disturbances, antidepressant-induced switching and cycle acceleration in bipolar disorder, occurrence of tolerance to the effects of antidepressants during long-term treatment, onset of resistance upon rechallenge with the same antidepressant drug in a few patients, and withdrawal syndromes following discontinuation of mood-elevating drugs. These phenomena in susceptible individuals may be explained on the basis of the oppositional model of tolerance. Continued drug treatment may recruit processes that oppose the initial acute effects of a drug and may result in loss of clinical effect. When drug treatment ends, these processes may operate unopposed, at least for some time, and increase vulnerability to relapse. Conclusion: The possibility that antidepressant drugs may worsen the course of depression needs to be tested, even though its scientific exploration is likely to encounter considerable methodological and ideological difficulties. The clinical implications of this hypothesis in depression are considerable. Antidepressant drugs are crucial in the treatment of major depressive episodes.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether TrkB ligands show antidepressant effects in an inflammation-induced model of depression. Methods: In this study, we examined the effects of TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) and TrkB antagonist ANA-12 on depression-like behavior and morphological changes in mice previously exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Protein levels of BDNF, phospho-TrkB (p-TrkB), and TrkB in the brain regions were also examined. Results: LPS caused a reduction of BDNF in the CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas LPS increased BDNF in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Dexamethason suppression tests showed hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in LPS-treated mice. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 7,8-DHF showed antidepressant effects on LPS-induced depression-like behavior, and i.p. pretreatment with ANA-12 blocked its antidepressant effects. Surprisingly, ANA-12 alone showed antidepressant-like effects on LPS-induced depression-like behavior. Furthermore, bilateral infusion of ANA-12 into the NAc showed antidepressant effects. Moreover, LPS caused a reduction of spine density in the CA3, DG, and PFC, whereas LPS increased spine density in the NAc. Interestingly, 7,8-DHF significantly attenuated LPS-induced reduction of p-TrkB and spine densities in the CA3, DG, and PFC, whereas ANA-12 significantly attenuated LPS-induced increases of p-TrkB and spine density in the NAc. Conclusions: The results suggest that LPS-induced inflammation may cause depression-like behavior by altering BDNF and spine density in the CA3, DG, PFC, and NAc, which may be involved in the antidepressant effects of 7,8-DHF and ANA-12, respectively.",0.5026548504829407

The beliefs of people receiving treatment are researched less often. Method: An online survey on causal beliefs about depression and experiences with antidepressants was completed by 1829 New Zealand adults prescribed anti-depressants in the preceding five years, 97.4% of whom proceeded to take antidepressants. Results: The most frequently endorsed of 17 causal beliefs were family stress, relationship problems, loss of loved one, financial problems, isolation, and abuse or neglect in childhood. Factor analysis produced three factors: 'bio-genetic', 'adulthood stress' and 'childhood adversity'. The most strongly endorsed explanations for increases in antidepressant prescribing invoked improved identification, reduced stigma and drug company marketing. The least strongly endorsed was 'Anti-depressants are the best treatment'. Regression analyses revealed that self-reported efficacy of the antidepressants was positively associated with bio-genetic causal beliefs, negatively associated with childhood adversity beliefs and unrelated to adulthood stress beliefs. The belief that 'People cannot׳ get better by themselves even if they try' was positively associated with bio-genetic beliefs. Limitations: The convenience sample may have been biased towards a favourable view of bio-genetic explanations, since 83% reported that the medication reduced their depression. Conclusions: Clinicians׳ should consider exploring patients׳ causal beliefs. The public, even when taking antidepressants, continues to hold a multi-factorial causal model of depression with a primary emphasis on psycho-social causes.

Methods: 2811 subjects with major depression were enrolled in this multicentre cross-sectional study. Current mixed symptoms, socio-demographic and other clinical variables were collected and compared among MDD-AIHM, MDD and BD patients. Results: 475 patients out of 2811 had history of AIHM (16.90%). In the MDD-AIHM group, familiarity for BD and rates of atypical features and comorbid anxiety, eating and borderline personality disorders were similar to BD and significantly more frequent compared to MDD group. MDD-AIHM patients had more frequently more than 3 episodes and reported higher rates of treatment resistance, mood lability and irritability following treatment with antidepressants. Frequencies of depression with mixed features and (hypo)manic symptoms were similar in patients of MDD-AIHM and BD groups and significantly higher in both groups than in MDD.

Risk was 2.6 (CI: 2.5-2.8) times greater with/without AD-treatment by meta-analysis of 10 controlled trials. Risk increased with time up to 24 months of treatment, with no secular change (1968-2012). Incidence rates were 4.5 (CI: 4.1-4.8)-times greater among juveniles than adults (5.62/1.26 %/year; p 0.0001). In 12 studies the overall rate of new BPD-diagnoses was 3.29% (1928/56,754) within 5.38 years (0.61 [0.58-0.64] %/year), or 5.6-times lower (3.42/0.61) than annualized rates of mood-switching. Conclusions: AD-treatment was associated with new mania-like responses in 8.18% of patients diagnosed with unipolar MDD. Contributions to mood-switching due to unrecognized BPD versus mood-elevating pharmacological effects, as well as quantitative associations between switching and later diagnosis of BPD not associated with AD-treatment remain uncertain. Limitations: Rates and definitions of mood-switching with ADs varied greatly, exposure-times rarely were precisely defined, and there was little information on predictive associations between mood-switches and BPD-diagnosis.",0.21520288288593292

Method: An online survey on a range of beliefs about depression, and experiences with antidepressants, was completed by 1829 New Zealand adults prescribed anti-depressants in the preceding five years, 97.4% of whom proceeded to take antidepressants. Results: Six of 17 beliefs about the causes of their own depression were endorsed by more than half the sample: chemical imbalance, family stress, work stress, heredity, relationship problems and distressing events in childhood. There were some marked differences in content, structure and level of conviction of beliefs about one׳s own depression and the sample׳s previously published beliefs about depression in general. There were also significant differences between the beliefs of demographic groupings. Regression analyses revealed that self-reported effectiveness of the antidepressants was positively associated with bio-genetic causal beliefs. The quality of the relationship with the prescribing doctor was positively related to a belief in chemical imbalance as a cause and negatively related to a belief in unemployment as a cause. Limitations: The convenience sample may have been biased towards a favourable view of bio-genetic explanations, since 83% reported that the medication reduced their depression. Conclusions: People experiencing depression hold complex, multifactorial and idiosyncratic sets of beliefs about the causes of their own depression, apparently based at least in part on their own life experiences and circumstances. Exploring those beliefs may enhance the doctor-patient relationship and selection of appropriate treatment modality.",0.33241868019104004

Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone with antidiabetic and insulin-sensitizing properties. Here we show that adiponectin levels in plasma are reduced in a chronic social-defeat stress model of depression, which correlates with decreased social interaction time. A reduction in adiponectin levels caused by haploinsufficiency results in increased susceptibility to social aversion, ""anhedonia,"" and learned helplessness and causes impaired glucocorticoid-mediated negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of an adiponectin neutralizing antibody precipitates stress-induced depressive-like behavior. Conversely, i.c.v. administration of exogenous adiponectin produces antidepressant-like behavioral effects in normal-weight mice and in diet-induced obese diabetic mice. Taken together, these results suggest a critical role of adiponectin in depressive-like behaviors and point to a potential innovative therapeutic approach for depressive disorders.",0.3003672957420349

Although antidepressants are effective in reducing depression, their use in patients with cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Objective: To undertake a secondary analysis to determine the effects of using antidepressants on morbidity and mortality in post-MI patients who participated in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease study. Design: Observational secondary analysis. Setting: Eight academic sites. Patients: The Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease clinical trial randomized 2481 depressed and/or socially isolated patients from October 1, 1996, to October 31, 1999. Depression was diagnosed using a structured clinical interview. This analysis was conducted on the 1834 patients enrolled with depression (849 women and 985 men). Intervention: Use of antidepressant medication. Main outcome measures: Event-free survival was defined as the absence of death or recurrent MI. All-cause mortality was also examined. To relate exposure to antidepressants to subsequent morbidity and mortality, the data were analyzed using a time-dependent covariate model. Results: During a mean follow-up of 29 months, 457 fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events occurred. The risk of death or recurrent MI was significantly lower in patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.84), as were the risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37-0.96) and recurrent MI (adjusted HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.90), compared with patients who did not use selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. For patients taking non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, the comparable HRs (95% CIs) were 0.72 (0.44-1.18), 0.64 (0.34-1.22), and 0.73 (0.38-1.38) for risk of death or recurrent MI, all-cause mortality, or recurrent MI, respectively, compared with nonusers. Conclusions: Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depressed patients who experience an acute MI might reduce subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Methods: We reviewed the available scientific literature to examine the incidence of mania and hypomania in non-bipolar patients who were treated with antidepressants. Results: Eighty-nine per cent of studies of antidepressants in major depressive disorder patients reported no cases of treatment-induced hypomania. No instances of treatment-induced hypomania were reported in three large studies of patients with chronic forms of depression. Conclusions: The rate of antidepressant-induced hypomania in major depressive disorder is within the rate of misdiagnosis of bipolar depression as unipolar.

The occupational health service (OHS) can offer work-directed interventions to support employers and employees. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on sickness absence and health of a work-directed intervention given by the OHS to employees with CMDs or stress-related symptoms. Methods: Randomisation was conducted at the OHS consultant level and each consultant was allocated into either giving a brief problem-solving intervention (PSI) or care as usual (CAU). The study group consisted of 100 employees with stress symptoms or CMDs. PSI was highly structured and used a participatory approach, involving both the employee and the employee's manager. CAU was also work-directed but not based on the same theoretical concepts as PSI. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, at 6 and at 12 months. Primary outcome was registered sickness absence during the 1-year follow-up period. Among the secondary outcomes were self-registered sickness absence, return to work (RTW) and mental health. Results: A statistical interaction for group × time was found on the primary outcome (p=0.033) and PSI had almost 15 days less sickness absence during follow-up compared with CAU. Concerning the secondary outcomes, PSI showed an earlier partial RTW and the mental health improved in both groups without significant group differences.

The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of all-cause and diagnosis-specific disability pension in sickness absentees with stress-related mental disorders. Methods: A cohort of 36304 non-retired individuals aged 16-64 years at 31.12.2004 with at-least one sickness absence spell due to stress-related mental disorders (SRMD) initiated in 2005 in Sweden was followed-up with regard to disability pension (2006-2010) by linkage of registers. Uni- and multivariate Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% Confidence Intervals, CI, were estimated using Cox regression for several risk markers. Results: During the follow-up period, 2735 individuals (7.5%) were granted a disability pension, predominantly due to mental diagnoses (n = 2004, 73.3%). In the multivariate analyses, female sex, age exceeding 35 years, low educational level, being born in a country outside EU25 and Northern Europe, residing outside big cities, living alone, having had a long duration of the first spell due to SRMD (&gt;90 days); mental disorders necessitating frequent specialised health care as well as comorbid somatic disorders were found to be predictive of granting disability pension. Some different patterns emerged for risk factors related to diagnosis-specific disability pension and for younger and older individuals. Conclusions: Several predictors could be identified as risk markers for disability pension. The variation in the effect of risk markers with regard to age and diagnosis of disability pension speaks in favour of the importance of a person-centered approach in treatment and rehabilitation.",0.5051501989364624
7_h,health_belief,35492418,Does stress cause sickness?,stress causes sickness,1.0,"Bats are particularly interesting vertebrates in their response to pathogens owing to extremes in terms of tolerance and resistance. Oxidation is often a by-product of processes involved in the acute phase response, which may result in antimicrobial or self-damaging effects. We measured the immunological and oxidative status responses of Egyptian fruit bats ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ) to a simulated bacterial infection using lipopolysaccharide injection. As expected, experimental bats exhibited increases in two humoral immunological markers. However, they surprisingly did not show any effects across two markers of oxidative damage and four antioxidant markers. We propose that this lack of effects on oxidative status may be due to a reduction in cell metabolism through sickness behaviours or given life history traits, such as a long lifespan and a frugivorous diet. Finally, the consistency in the pattern of elevation in haptoglobin and lysozyme between current and previous findings highlights their utility as diagnostic markers for extracellular infections in bats.",0.1841205209493637

They result in suffering for the individual and considerable financial costs for the employer and for society at large. The occupational health service (OHS) can offer interventions in which both the individual and the work situation are taken into account. The aim of this paper is to describe the design of a study evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention given at the OHS to employees with CMDs or stress-related symptoms at work. In addition, intervention fidelity and its relation to the outcome will be assessed in a process analysis. Methods: The study is designed as a cluster randomized trial in which the participating OHS consultants are randomized into either delivering the intervention or performing care as usual. Employees with CMDs or stress-related symptoms at work are recruited consecutively by the OHS consultants. The intervention aims to improve the match between the employee and the job situation. Interviews are held individually with the employee and the nearest supervisor, after which a joint meeting with both the employee and the supervisor takes place. A participatory approach is applied by which the supervisor and the employee are guided by the OHS consultant and encouraged to actively take part in problem solving concerning the work situation. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at six and 12 months. A long-term follow-up at 3 years will also be performed. The primary outcome is registered sickness absence during a 1-year period after study inclusion. Secondary outcomes are mental health and work ability. The intervention's cost effectiveness, compared to treatment as usual, both for society and for the employer will be evaluated. A process evaluation by both the OHS consultants and the employee will be carried out. Discussion: The study includes analyses of the effectiveness of the intervention (clinical and economic) as well as an analysis of its implementation at the participating OHSs. Possible methodological challenges such as selection bias and risk of contamination between OHS consultants delivering the experimental condition and consultants giving usual care are discussed.

Objectives: The purpose of the study was to examine the relationships between nausea and vomiting, perceived stress, social support and their ability to predict maternal psychosocial adaptation among Taiwanese women during early pregnancy. Design: A correlational, cross-sectional research design. Setting: Four prenatal clinics in Taiwan. Participants: Women (n=243) who had completed the 6-16 week of gestation consented to participate. Methods: Subjects completed four self-report questionnaires in additional to providing demographic data: Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching (INVR), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL), and the Prenatal Self-Evaluation Questionnaire (PSEQ). Results: Pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting was experienced in varying degrees by 188 (77.4%) women. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that 37.6% of the variance in maternal psychosocial adaptation was explained by the severity of nausea and vomiting, perceived stress, social support, and pregnancy planning. Conclusions: Women at higher risk for poor maternal psychosocial adaptation have not planned their pregnancy and experience severe pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting.

Despite the size of this health problem, research on risk factors for severe medical outcomes, like suicidal behavior, is lacking to date. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of suicide attempt and suicide among sickness absentees with SRMD. Methods: A cohort of 36,304 non-retired individuals, aged 16-64 years on 31.12.2004, with at least one sickness absence spell due to SRMD, initiated in 2005, was followed up with regard to suicide attempt (2006-2009) and suicide (2006-2008). Univariate and multivariate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for a number of predictors. Results: During the follow-up period, 266 individuals attempted suicide and 34 committed suicide. In the multivariate analyses, the following factors increased the risk of suicide attempt: = 25 years of age, low educational level, lone parenthood, &gt; 1 sickness absence spell, long duration of the first spell of sickness absence due to SRMD (&gt; 180 days), &gt; 4 and &gt; 8 days of inpatient care due to somatic or mental diagnoses (2000-2005), and &gt; 4 and &gt; 1 outpatient visits due to somatic or mental diagnoses (2001-2005), respectively.

Modification of symptomatic responses by stress may play a role in medically unexplained symptoms attributed to low-level chemical exposures. Objectives: We hypothesized that the combination of exposure to diesel exhaust (DE) and acute psychological stress would cause sickness responses in healthy volunteers. Moreover, these responses would be greater in individuals with self-reported prior chemical odor intolerance. Methods: One hundred adult subjects underwent 1-hr exposures to diluted DE and clean air control. Half of the subjects performed a public-speaking stressor task during the exposures. Subjects completed questionnaires to determine their Chemical Odor Intolerance Index score. Plasma cortisol, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and the severity of 35 symptoms were measured at time points before and after the exposures. Results: Subjects exposed to DE demonstrated small but statistically significant increases in severity for several symptom categories, including sickness response and upper respiratory, central nervous system, and total symptoms. The psychological stressor did not increase symptom severity independently or via interaction with DE. Subjects with prior self-reported chemical intolerance had more severe sickness response symptoms from DE. Conclusions: These results suggest that exposure to DE can cause acute sickness response symptoms and that these symptoms are also associated with increased levels of self-reported chemical intolerance. The results did not confirm our hypothesis that an acute stressor would increase sickness response symptom severity during the exposure.",0.27280235290527344

Aims: To develop a clinically implementable prediction model for the duration of SA due to stress-related disorders. Methods: All new SA spells with F43 diagnosis code lasting &gt;14 days and initiated between 2010-01-01 and 2012-06-30 were identified through data from the Social Insurance Agency. Information on baseline predictors was linked on individual level from other nationwide registers. Piecewise-constant hazard regression was used to predict the duration of the SA. Split-sample validation was used to develop and validate the model, and c-statistics and calibration plots to evaluate it. Results: Overall 83,443 SA spells, belonging to 77,173 individuals were identified. The median SA duration was 55 days (10% were &gt;365 days). Age, sex, geographical region, employment status, educational level, extent of SA at start and SA days, outpatient healthcare visits, and multi-morbidity in the preceding 365 days were selected to the final model.

Hair loss is also related to hypothyroidism, which can be induced by lithium and other agents. Alopecia might not be reported by some people, but physicians should be aware of this potential problem which may contribute to noncompliance. Lithium causes hair loss in 12-19% of long-term users. Valproic acid and/ or divalproex precipitates alopecia in up to 12% of patients in a dose-dependent relationship. Incidences up to 28% are observed with high valproate concentration exposures. These pharmaceuticals also can change hair color and structure. The occurrence of carbamazepine-induced alopecia is at or below 6%. Hair loss is less common with other mood stabilizers. Tricyclic antidepressants, maprotilene, trazodone, and virtually all the new generation of antidepressants may on rare occasions lead to alopecia.

Drugs may affect anagen follicles through 2 main different modalities: (i) by inducing an abrupt cessation of mitotic activity in rapidly dividing hair matrix cells (anagen effluvium) or (ii) by precipitating the follicles into premature rest (telogen effluvium). In anagen effluvium, hair loss usually occurs within days to weeks of drug administration, whereas in telogen effluvium, hair loss becomes evident 2 to 4 months after starting treatment. Anagen effluvium is a prominent adverse effect of antineoplastic agents, which cause acute damage of rapidly dividing hair matrix cells. Telogen effluvium may be a consequence of a large number of drugs including anticoagulants, retinol (vitamin A) and its derivatives, interferons and antihyperlipidaemic drugs. Drug-induced hair loss is usually reversible after interruption of treatment. The prevalence and severity of alopecia depend on the drug as well as on individual predisposition. Some drugs produce hair loss in most patients receiving appropriate dosages while other drugs are only occasionally responsible for hair abnormalities.

Drug-induced alopecia is usually described as a diffuse non-scarring alopecia which is reversible upon withdrawal of the drug. Only a few drugs (mainly antimitotic agents) routinely cause hair loss whereas many drugs may be the cause of isolated cases of alopecia. Some psychotropic drugs are likely to induce a drug-related alopecia. Case reports with tricyclic antidepressants rarely appear in the literature. It has been reported that 15 per cent of patients taking lithium developed hair thinning. Hair loss is reported secondary to some anticonvulsant agents mainly valproic acid.

Data sources: A literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), and the Cochrane database (through May 2014). Relevant conference abstracts and product monographs were reviewed. Search terms included antiretroviral, individual antiretroviral classes and names, highly active antiretroviral therapy, HIV, AIDS, alopecia, hair, hair loss and drug. Study selection and data extraction: English-language studies and case reports were included. A total of 16 articles and 1 conference abstract were retrieved, with a total of 46 patients with hair loss. Data synthesis: The protease inhibitor class, in particular indinavir, was most commonly reported to cause hair loss, followed by the NRTI, lamivudine. The majority of cases presented with alopecia of the scalp alone, with a median time of onset of 2.5 months. Management involved discontinuing the drug in most cases, with at least partial reversal in half the cases. Conclusions: In antiretroviral-induced alopecia, discontinuation of the suspected agent is the optimal management, and hair regrowth should occur within 1 to 3 months. Management may also include replacing the offending medication with an antiretroviral less likely to cause hair loss. It is essential to rule out other causes of alopecia with a complete patient history, including characterization of the hair loss and assessment of the patient's medical history, medication use, and family history of alopecia.",0.5716561079025269

The objective of the study was to compare the CSE profiles in a large specialty practice-based sample of patients taking both older and newer AEDs. Methods: As part of the Columbia and Yale AED Database Project, we reviewed patient records including demographics, medical history, AED use, and side effects for 1903 adult patients (≥16years of age) newly started on an AED. Cosmetic side effects were determined by patient or physician report in the medical record and included acne, gingival hyperplasia, hair loss, hirsutism, and weight gain. We compared the overall rate of CSEs and intolerable CSEs (ICSEs-CSEs that led to dosage reduction or discontinuation) between different AEDs in both monotherapy and polytherapy. Results: Overall, CSEs occurred in 110/1903 (5.8%) patients and led to intolerability in 70/1903 (3.7%) patients. Weight gain was the most commonly reported CSE (68/1903, 3.6%) and led to intolerability in 63 (3.3%) patients. Alopecia was the second most common patient-reported CSE (36/1903, 1.9%) and was intolerable in 33/1903 (1.7%) patients. Risk factors for CSEs included female sex (7.0% vs. 4.3% in males; p 0.05) and any prior CSE (37% vs. 2.9% in patients without prior CSE; p 0.001). Significantly more CSEs were attributed to valproic acid (59/270; 21.9%; p 0.001) and pregabalin (14/143; 9.8%; p 0.001) than to all other AEDs. Significantly less CSEs were attributed to levetiracetam (7/524; 1.3%; p=0.002). Weight gain was most frequently associated with valproic acid (35/270; 13.0%; p 0.001) and pregabalin (12/143; 8.4%; p 0.001). Hair loss was most commonly reported among patients taking valproic acid (24/270; 8.9%; p 0.001). Finally, gingival hyperplasia was most commonly reported in patients taking phenytoin (10/404; 2.5%; p 0.001). Cosmetic side effects leading to dosage change or discontinuation occurred most frequently with pregabalin and valproic acid compared with all other AEDs (13.3 and 5.6% vs. 2.3%; p 0.001). For patients who had been on an AED in monotherapy (n=677), CSEs and ICSEs were still more likely to be attributed to valproic acid (30.2% and 17.1%, respectively) than to any other AED (both p 0.001). Significance: Weight gain and alopecia were the most common patient-reported CSEs in this study, and weight gain was the most likely cosmetic side effect to result in dosage adjustment or medication discontinuation. Particular attention should be paid to pregabalin, phenytoin, and valproic acid when considering cosmetic side effects. Female patients and patients who have had prior CSE(s) to AED(s) were more likely to report CSEs. Knowledge of specific CSE rates for each AED found in this study may be useful in clinical practice.",0.2645411789417267

9_h,health_belief,21335995,Does milk cause acne?,milk causes acne,1.0,"Acne vulgaris, the most common skin disease of western civilization, has evolved to an epidemic affecting more than 85% of adolescents. Acne can be regarded as an indicator disease of exaggerated insulinotropic western nutrition. Especially milk and whey protein-based products contribute to elevations of postprandial insulin and basal insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) plasma levels. It is the evolutional principle of mammalian milk to promote growth and support anabolic conditions for the neonate during the nursing period. Whey proteins are most potent inducers of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide secreted by enteroendocrine K cells which in concert with hydrolyzed whey protein-derived essential amino acids stimulate insulin secretion of pancreatic β-cells. Increased insulin/IGF-I signaling activates the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt pathway, thereby reducing the nuclear content of the transcription factor FoxO1, the key nutrigenomic regulator of acne target genes. Nuclear FoxO1 deficiency has been linked to all major factors of acne pathogenesis, i.e. androgen receptor transactivation, comedogenesis, increased sebaceous lipogenesis, and follicular inflammation. The elimination of the whey protein-based insulinotropic mechanisms of milk will be the most important future challenge for nutrition research. Both, restriction of milk consumption or generation of less insulinotropic milk will have an enormous impact on the prevention of epidemic western diseases like obesity, diabetes mellitus, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and acne.",0.45466795563697815
9_h,health_belief,19243483,Does milk cause acne?,milk causes acne,1.0,"Consumption of cow's milk and cow's milk protein result in changes of the hormonal axis of insulin, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) in humans. Milk consumption raises IGF-1 serum levels in the perinatal period, adolescence and adulthood. During puberty with the physiological onset of increased secretion of growth hormone, IGF-1 serum levels increase and are further enhanced by milk consumption. IGF-1 is a potent mitogen; after binding to its receptor in various tissues, it induces cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. Keratinocytes and sebocytes, as well as the androgen-synthesizing adrenals and gonads, are stimulated by IGF-1. The epidemic incidence of adolescent acne in Western milk-consuming societies can be explained by the increased insulin- and IGF-1-stimulation of sebaceous glands mediated by milk consumption. Acne can be regarded as a model for chronic Western diseases with pathologically increased IGF-1-stimulation. Many other organs, such as the thymus, bones, all glands, and vascular smooth muscle cells as well as neurons are subject to this abnormally increased hormonal stimulation. The milk-induced change of the IGF-1-axis most likely contributes to the development of fetal macrosomia, induction of atopy, accelerated linear growth, atherosclerosis, carcinogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases.

Objective: To examine whether high intakes of dairy products in early adolescence is associated with moderate to severe acne in later adolescence. Methods: The study is a longitudinal, questionnaire-based population study of Norwegian adolescents. Students attending the 10th grade (15-16 years old) of compulsory schooling in Oslo in 2000-2001 and the 13th grade (18-19 years old) 3 years later, in 2004, were invited. Dairy product consumption was self-reported at age 15-16 and acne severity was self-assessed and reported at age 18-19. Results: The overall prevalence of moderate to severe acne was 13.9%. High intakes (≥2 glasses per day) of full-fat dairy products were associated with moderate to severe acne. In boys with exclusively high intakes of full-fat dairy products, the odds ratio for acne was 4.81 (1.59-14.56).

The objective was to determine dietary effects of lactoferrin-enriched fermented milk on patients with acne vulgaris, an inflammatory skin condition. Methods: Patients 18 to 30 y of age were randomly assigned to ingest fermented milk with 200 mg of lactoferrin daily (n = 18, lactoferrin group) or fermented milk only (n = 18, placebo group) in a 12-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Acne lesion counts and grade were assessed at monthly visits. The condition of the skin by hydration, sebum and pH, and skin surface lipids was assessed at baseline and 12 wk. Results: Acne showed improvement in the lactoferrin group by significant decreases in inflammatory lesion count by 38.6%, total lesion count by 23.1%, and acne grade by 20.3% compared with the placebo group at 12 wk. Furthermore, sebum content in the lactoferrin group was decreased by 31.1% compared with the placebo group. The amount of total skin surface lipids decreased in both groups. However, of the major lipids, amounts of triacylglycerols and free fatty acids decreased in the lactoferrin group, whereas the amount of free fatty acids decreased only in the placebo group. The decreased amount of triacylglycerols in the lactoferrin group was significantly correlated with decreases in serum content, acne lesion counts, and acne grade.

Purpose: We summarized earlier data on the association between milk and dairy intake and risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture through a meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic literature search of relevant reports published in PubMed, ISI (Web of Science), EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar until August 2018 was conducted. Results: Total dairy intake was protectively associated with reduced risk of osteoporosis based on cross-sectional and case-control studies (0.63; 95% CI: 0.55-0.73). Milk consumption was not associated with the risk of osteoporosis (overall RR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.57-1.08). In non-linear dose-response meta-analysis, increase intake of dairy (at the level of 0 to 250 grams per day) was associated with a reduced risk of osteoporosis ( P nonlinearty = 0.005). Meta-regression of included studies revealed an inverse linear association between dairy and milk intake and risk of osteoporosis; such that every additional 200-gram intake of dairy and milk was associated with a 22% and 37% reduced risk of osteoporosis, respectively. In terms of hip fracture, milk consumption was associated with a 25% reduced risk of hip fracture only in cross-sectional and case-control studies (overall RR = 0.75; 95%CI: 0.57-0.99). In linear meta-regression, every additional 200-gram milk intake per day was associated with a 9% greater risk of hip fracture in cohort studies. Conclusion: Despite an inverse association between milk and dairy intake and risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture in cross-sectional and case-control studies, no such association was seen in cohort studies. Given the advantages of the cohort over case-control studies, we concluded that a greater intake of milk and dairy products was not associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture.",0.10655397921800613
10_h,health_belief,27726930,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,"Cow's milk is often severely criticized as a cause of multiple health problems, including an increased risk of fractures. A close look at the scientific literature shows a striking contradiction. On the one hand, experimental studies of surrogate markers (e.g., bone turnover markers and bone mineral density [BMD]) usually indicate benefits from drinking cow's milk. On the other, the findings from epidemiological studies are conflicting and disconcerting. In all age groups, including children and postmenopausal women, consuming cow's milk, powdered milk supplements, or whey protein is associated with a slower bone turnover and unchanged or higher BMD values. These benefits are particularly marked in populations where calcium deficiency is prevalent, for instance in Asian countries. No interventional studies have addressed the fracture risk potentially associated with drinking cow's milk. The only available data come from epidemiological observational studies, whose results are conflicting, with a lower fracture risk in some cases and no difference or a higher risk in others. Several hypotheses have been offered to explain these findings, such as a deleterious effect of D-galactose, lactose intolerance, and acid overload. Epidemiological studies face many obstacles when seeking to detect effects of a single food, particularly the multiplicity of interactions among foods. Furthermore, reliable dietary intake data must be collected over prolonged periods, often long before the occurrence of a fracture, and defective recall may therefore introduce a major yet often unrecognized bias, particularly in populations where calcium deficiency is uncommon. To date, there is no conclusive evidence that we should modify our currently high level of consumption of cow's milk.",0.02493668906390667
10_h,health_belief,22081694,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,"Recently the lay press has claimed a hypothetical association among dairy product consumption, generation of dietary acid, and harm to human health. This theoretical association is based on the idea that the protein and phosphate in milk and dairy products make them acid-producing foods, which cause our bodies to become acidified, promoting diseases of modern civilization. Some authors have suggested that dairy products are not helpful and perhaps detrimental to bone health because higher osteoporotic fracture incidence is observed in countries with higher dairy product consumption. However, scientific evidence does not support any of these claims. Milk and dairy products neither produce acid upon metabolism nor cause metabolic acidosis, and systemic pH is not influenced by diet. Observations of higher dairy product intake in countries with prevalent osteoporosis do not hold when urban environments are compared, likely due to physical labor in rural locations. Milk and other dairy products continue to be a good source of dietary protein and other nutrients. Key teaching points: Measurement of an acidic pH urine does not reflect metabolic acidosis or an adverse health condition. The modern diet, and dairy product consumption, does not make the body acidic. Alkaline diets alter urine pH but do not change systemic pH. Net acid excretion is not an important influence of calcium metabolism. Milk is not acid producing.

Chocolate is a rich source of antioxidant and antiinflammatory flavonoids and dietary minerals with the potential to benefit bone health. However, other chocolate constituents such as cocoa butter, sugar, and methylxanthines may be detrimental to bone. Human studies investigating the role of chocolate consumption on serum bone markers and bone mineral density (BMD) have been inconsistent. A contributing factor is likely the different composition and thereby the nutrient and bioactive content among chocolate types. White and milk chocolate are high in sugar and low in flavonoids and most minerals. Dark chocolate (45-85% cocoa solids) is high in flavonoids, most minerals, and low in sugar with ≥70% cocoa solids resulting in higher fat and methylxanthine content. The aim of this review was to examine the relationship between chocolate consumption and its constiuents, including flavonoid content, on bone health and osteoporosis risk. Studies showed postmenopausal women had no bone effects at moderate chocolate intakes, whereas adolescents consuming chocolate had greater longitudinal bone growth. Based on flavonoid and mineral content, unsweetened cocoa powder appeared to be the best option followed by dark chocolate with higher cocoa content in terms of supporting and preserving bone health. Determining dietary recommendations for chocolate consumption relative to bone health is important because of the growing popularity of chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, and an expected increase in consumption owing to suggestions of health benefits against various degenerative diseases.",0.12591378390789032

Coincident with the promotion of calcium carbonate as treatment for both dyspepsia and osteoporosis, milk-alkali syndrome is now a common cause of hypercalcemia severe enough to require admission to the hospital. The syndrome accounted for less than 2% of such admissions before 1990, but from 1990 through 1993, it was the cause of hypercalcemia for over 12% of these patients. Only primary hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia of malignancy (excluding multiple myeloma) are more common. The diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome is made almost entirely based on the patient's history; careful attention to dietary practices and over-the-counter drug use is required, as numerous over-the-counter medications contain calcium carbonate. Modern assays for PTH demonstrate the expected suppression of PTH by hypercalcemia. Nonetheless, measurement of PTH must be performed in a timely manner as treatment with intravenous saline may result in hypocalcemia and elevated PTH soon after admission. Given the pathophysiology of milk-alkali syndrome compared to other causes of hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia with rebound hyperparathyroidism is probably unique to milk-alkali syndrome.",0.09748712182044983
10_h,health_belief,24093748,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,"Osteoporosis is a progressive disease of the skeleton characterised by bone fragility due to a reduction in bone mass and possibly to alteration in bone architecture that lead to a propensity to fracture with minimum trauma. Most osteoporotic fractures occur at locations rich in trabecular or cancellous bone and usually related to post menopausal women. Recently, silymarin received attention due to its alternative beneficial effect on bone formation. It is a mixture of flavonoids with powerful antioxidant properties. This review focuses on the use of milk thistle or silymarin for the treatment of osteoporosis that may be related to fracture bone. Silymarin shows potent antioxidant herb that may modulate multiple genes in favour of helping to build bone and prevent bone loss. In the mouse fracture healing model, silymarin supplementation improved tibial healing with elevated BMD and serum levels of ALP and osteocalcin. Silymarin also demonstrated clear estrogenic antiosteoporotic effects in bone structure. Silymarin appears to play a crucial role to prevent bone loss and might regulate osteogenesis and may be beneficial for fracture healing. If silymarin is considered for the use of post menopausal women, it may be used for the treatment of osteoporosis. It would be of great benefit to postmenopausal women to develop an oestrogen antagonist that is as potent and efficacious as oestrogen in preventing bone loss without the major side effect associated with HRT.",0.454202800989151

Objective: This review aimed to assess the scientific evidence mainly from meta-analyses of observational studies and randomised controlled trials, on dairy intake and risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cancer, and all-cause mortality. Results: The most recent evidence suggested that intake of milk and dairy products was associated with reduced risk of childhood obesity. In adults, intake of dairy products was shown to improve body composition and facilitate weight loss during energy restriction. In addition, intake of milk and dairy products was associated with a neutral or reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly stroke. Furthermore, the evidence suggested a beneficial effect of milk and dairy intake on bone mineral density but no association with risk of bone fracture. Among cancers, milk and dairy intake was inversely associated with colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and breast cancer, and not associated with risk of pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, or lung cancer, while the evidence for prostate cancer risk was inconsistent. Finally, consumption of milk and dairy products was not associated with all-cause mortality. Calcium-fortified plant-based drinks have been included as an alternative to dairy products in the nutrition recommendations in several countries. However, nutritionally, cow's milk and plant-based drinks are completely different foods, and an evidence-based conclusion on the health value of the plant-based drinks requires more studies in humans. Conclusion: The totality of available scientific evidence supports that intake of milk and dairy products contribute to meet nutrient recommendations, and may protect against the most prevalent chronic diseases, whereas very few adverse effects have been reported.",0.07955709844827652

Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of high calcium skimmed milk (Anlene Gold, New Zealand Milk, Wellington, New Zealand) to reduce bone loss in Chinese postmenopausal women. Two hundred subjects aged 55-65 years and who were more than 5 years postmenopausal were randomized to a milk group and control group. The milk group consumed 50 g of high calcium skimmed milk powder daily, which contained 1200 mg calcium (taken as two glasses of milk a day). The control group continued with their usual diet. Using repeated measures ANCOVA, the milk supplement was found to significantly reduce the percentage of bone loss at the total body compared to the control group at 24 months (control -1.04%, milk -0.13%; P 0.001). At the lumbar spine, the percentage of bone loss in the control group was significantly higher (-0.90%) when compared to the milk (-0.13%) supplemented group at 24 months (P 0.05). Similarly, milk supplementation reduced the percentage of bone loss at the femoral neck (control -1.21%, milk 0.51%) (P 0.01) and total hip (control -2.17%, milk -0.50%) (P 0.01). The supplemented group did not experience any significant weight gain over the 24 months. The serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level improved significantly (P 0.01) from 69.1 +/- 16.1 nmol/l at baseline to 86.4 +/- 22.0 nmol/l at 24 months in the milk group. In conclusion, ingestion of high calcium skimmed milk was effective in reducing the rate of bone loss at clinically important lumbar spine and hip sites in postmenopausal Chinese women in Malaysia.

This study was designed to reflect the trend of replacing milk with carbonated beverages in a group of young men on a low-calcium diet and studies the effects of this replacement on calcium homeostasis and bone turnover. This controlled crossover intervention study included 11 healthy men (22-29 years) who were given a low-calcium basic diet in two 10-day intervention periods with an intervening 10-day washout. During one period, they drank 2.5 l of Coca Cola per day and during the other period 2.5 l of semi-skimmed milk. Serum concentrations of calcium, phosphate, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D), osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP) and cross-linked C-telopeptides (CTX), plasma intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) and urinary cross-linked N-telopeptides (NTX) were determined at baseline and endpoint of each intervention period. An increase in serum phosphate (P 0.001), 1,25(OH)2D (P 0.001), PTH (P=0.046) and osteocalcin (P 0.001) was observed in the cola period compared to the milk period. Also, bone resorption was significantly increased following the cola period, seen as increased serum CTX (P 0.001) and urinary NTX (P 0.001) compared to the milk period. No changes were observed in serum concentrations of calcium or B-ALP. This study demonstrates that over a 10-day period high intake of cola with a low-calcium diet induces increased bone turnover compared to a high intake of milk with a low-calcium diet. Thus, the trend towards a replacement of milk with cola and other soft drinks, which results in a low calcium intake, may negatively affect bone health as indicated by this short-term study.",0.1798240840435028

The aim of this study is to investigate correlations between individual subjective and objective parameters of stable NP disease. Methods: 65 NP patients scored their sinonasal symptoms on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and questionnaires (SNOT-22 and SF-36). Peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) measurement, Sniffinatm Sticks (SS) smell test, blood analysis for eosinophilia, total IgE and culture for Staphylococcus aureus (SA) were performed. Results: VAS scores for nasal blockage correlated with the SNOT-22 and SF-36 scores, which was not observed for VAS of other symptoms. VAS scores for nasal blockage correlated well with PNIF values as well as VAS scores for smell dysfunction and SS results (both p 0.001). NP size correlated with VAS scores for nasal blockage (p 0.01) but not with VAS for other symptoms. NP size showed an inverse correlation with PNIF and SS scores (both p 0.05). Blood eosinophilia correlated with subjective smell reduction (p 0.05). The presence of SA or total IgE levels were not associated with symptoms of NP disease. Conclusion: PNIF and SS are good tools to evaluate symptoms of nasal obstruction and smell reduction in NP disease.

The main symptoms of nasal polyps are perennial nasal congestion, nasal obstruction, and anosmia or hyposmia. Unlike patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps who present with headache and facial pain, patients with nasal polyps typically do not complain of those symptoms. Nasal polyps appear as semitranslucent, pale gray growths in the nasal cavity in contrast to pink or erythematous adjacent mucosa. Nasal polyps occur more frequently in patients with persistent asthma, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), CRS, and cystic fibrosis. Children with nasal polyps should be evaluated for cystic fibrosis. Churg-Strauss syndrome and ciliary dyskinesia also may be associated with nasal polyps. Nasal polyps have increased numbers of activated eosinophils, mast cells, and IgE. Staphylococcal superantigens may play a role in the Th2 type of chronic eosinophilic inflammation observed in nasal polyps. Dysfunction of the epithelial barrier in nasal polyps causing reduced levels of antimicrobial proteins has been described. Topical nasal steroids are the treatment of choice. They significantly decrease polyp size, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and increase nasal airflow. Short courses of oral steroids may be needed to reduce polyp size followed by maintenance therapy with intranasal steroids. Surgery is reserved for cases when polyps cause severe obstruction, recurrent sinusitis, and for patients who have failed medical therapy.

Acute rhinosinusitis is defined as symptoms that last 12 weeks, and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as symptoms that last &gt; 12 weeks. CRS is divided into three groups: CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. Nasal polyps are inflammatory outgrowths of paranasal sinus mucosa caused by chronic mucosal inflammation and are present in 20% of patients with CRS. Nasal polyps typically present with nasal congestion, nasal obstruction, and anosmia or hyposmia, and occur more frequently in patients with persistent asthma, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), CRS, and cystic fibrosis. The sinus cavities are lined with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelial cells interspersed with mucous goblet cells. Cilia continuously sweep the mucous toward the ostial openings and are important in maintaining the proper environment of the sinus cavities. The frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoid sinuses drain into the ostiomeatal unit of the middle meatus. The posterior ethmoid sinuses and superior sphenoid sinuses drain into the sphenoethmoid recess of the superior meatus. Most acute sinus infections are caused by viruses, and, therefore, it is not surprising that the majority of patients improve within 2 weeks without antibiotic treatment. A bacterial infection should be considered if symptoms worsen or fail to improve within 7-10 days. Combining an intranasal corticosteroid with an antibiotic reduces symptoms more effectively than antibiotics alone. Topical nasal steroids are the treatment of choice for nasal polyps. They significantly decrease polyp size, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea, and increase nasal airflow. Short courses of oral steroids may be needed to reduce polyp size, followed by maintenance therapy with topical steroids. Surgery is reserved for patients in which polyps cause severe obstruction or recurrent sinusitis and for patients for whom medical therapy has failed.

Rhinitis and sinusitis usually coexist and are concurrent in most individuals; thus, the correct terminology is now rhinosinusitis. Rhinosinusitis (including nasal polyps) is defined as inflammation of the nose and the paranasal sinuses characterised by two or more symptoms, one of which should be either nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip), +/- facial pain/pressure, +/- reduction or loss of smell; and either endoscopic signs of polyps and/or mucopurulent discharge primarily from middle meatus and/or; oedema/mucosal obstruction primarily in middle meatus, and/or CT changes showing mucosal changes within the ostiomeatal complex and/or sinuses. The paper gives different definitions for epidemiology, first line and second line treatment and for research. Furthermore the paper describes the anatomy and (patho)physiology, epidemiology and predisposing factors, inflammatory mechanisms, evidence based diagnosis, medical and surgical treatment in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis in adults and children.

For individual examinations, there is no gold standard method that can discriminate work-related discomfort from other causes of rhinitis. Objectives: Studies of the effects of occupation on farmers' health have mainly focused on lower airways; few studies have examined effects on upper airways. This study investigated nasal functions in three groups of farmers (swine, milk and grain producers) and a control group using different methods, suitable for field studies. Subjects and methods: Health-related complaints were examined and several functional tests, such as expirogram, olfactory threshold test, acoustic rhinometry, nasal lavage with biomarkers of inflammation (eosinophilic cationic proteins (ECP), myeloperoxidase (MPO), tryptase, albumin) and allergy tests were performed. The different tests were correlated to nasal complaints and to each other. Results: Nasal blockage complaints were more common among farmers; overall, nasal polyps were more frequent in grain producers. Objective parameters showed more pronounced mucosal swelling in farmers and higher concentrations of ECP in nasal lavage compared with controls. Lung function, olfactory threshold, atopy frequency and allergen-specific IgE to the storage mite Lepidoglyphus destructor did not differ between farmers and controls. Mucosal swelling measured with acoustic rhinometry was more pronounced in subjects with nasal complaints, hypersensitivity, nasal polyps and symptoms from lower airways.

The aim of this study was investigate the effect of nasal obstruction related to chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis on cognitive functions. Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis causing bilateral total or near total nasal obstruction were enrolled in the study. Symptoms of nasal congestion, loss of smell, postnasal drip, headaches, snoring, concentration difficulties and blunted affect were evaluated by Visual Analog Scale. Brief symptom inventory test, Stroop test, visual aural digit span, serial digit learning test and P300 test were used to evaluate cognitive functions. Three months after treatment, the tests done before surgery were repeated and the results were compared. A total of 30 patients were included in the study. On the Visual Analog Scale, all symptoms showed significant postoperative improvement in all patients ( p 0.001 for all symptoms). Preoperative nasal congestion accompanied with impaired concentration were detected in 27 patients (90%), and these symptoms recovered in all these patients after treatment ( p = 0.035) (correlation coefficient 0.4). Only 22 patients completed the neuropsychological tests. The mean preoperative Stroop test (23.16 ± 5.30), visual aural digit span test (24.68 ± 3.52), and serial digit learning test (16.18 ± 5.35) scores were showed significant improvement compared with mean postoperative Stroop test (21.12 ± 5.69), visual aural digit span test (26.45 ± 2.98), and serial digit learning test (19.31 ± 4.47) scores ( p = 0.047, p = 0.022, p = 0.005 respectively).

Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits signalling of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, key drivers of type 2 inflammation, and has been approved for use in atopic dermatitis and asthma. In these two studies, we aimed to assess efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with CRSwNP despite previous treatment with systemic corticosteroids, surgery, or both. Methods: LIBERTY NP SINUS-24 and LIBERTY NP SINUS-52 were two multinational, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies assessing dupilumab added to standard of care in adults with severe CRSwNP. SINUS-24 was done in 67 centres in 13 countries, and SINUS-52 was done in 117 centres in 14 countries. Eligible patients were 18 years or older with bilateral CRSwNP and symptoms despite intranasal corticosteroid use, receiving systemic corticosteroids in the preceding 2 years, or having had sinonasal surgery. Patients in SINUS-24 were randomly assigned (1:1) to subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg or placebo every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. Patients in SINUS-52 were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks for 52 weeks, dupilumab every 2 weeks for 24 weeks and then every 4 weeks for the remaining 28 weeks, or placebo every 2 weeks for 52 weeks. All patients were randomly assigned centrally with a permuted block randomisation schedule. Randomisation was stratified by asthma or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease status at screening, previous surgery at screening, and country. Patients with or without comorbid asthma were included. Coprimary endpoints were changes from baseline to week 24 in nasal polyp score (NPS), nasal congestion or obstruction, and sinus Lund-Mackay CT scores (a coprimary endpoint in Japan), done in an intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in a pooled population of both dupilumab groups in SINUS-52 up to week 24 and the dupilumab group in SINUS-24 and the placebo groups in both studies until week 24.

Findings: Between Dec 5, 2016, and Aug 3, 2017, 276 patients were enrolled in SINUS-24, with 143 in the dupilumab group and 133 in the placebo group receiving at least one study drug dose. Between Nov 28, 2016, and Aug 28, 2017, 448 patients were enrolled in SINUS-52, with 150 receiving at least one dose of dupilumab every 2 weeks, 145 receiving at least one dose of dupilumab every 2 weeks for 24 weeks and every 4 weeks until week 52, and 153 receiving at least one dose of placebo. Dupilumab significantly improved the coprimary endpoints in both studies. At 24 weeks, least squares mean difference in NPS of dupilumab treatment versus placebo was -2·06 (95% CI -2·43 to -1·69; p 0·0001) in SINUS-24 and -1·80 (-2·10 to -1·51; p 0·0001) in SINUS-52; difference in nasal congestion or obstruction score was -0·89 (-1·07 to -0·71; p 0·0001) in SINUS-24 and -0·87 (-1·03 to -0·71; p 0·0001) in SINUS-52; and difference in Lund-Mackay CT scores was -7·44 (-8·35 to -6·53; p 0·0001) in SINUS-24 and -5·13 (-5·80 to -4·46; p 0·0001) in SINUS-52. The most common adverse events (nasopharyngitis, worsening of nasal polyps and asthma, headache, epistaxis, and injection-site erythema) were more frequent with placebo. Interpretation: In adult patients with severe CRSwNP, dupilumab reduced polyp size, sinus opacification, and severity of symptoms and was well tolerated.

It includes details of the role of the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) - PDE5 pathway in the LUT organs (bladder and prostate) in addition to the available data on tadalafil in patients with LUTS secondary to BPH with or without erectile dysfunction (ED). Expert opinion: Preclinical and clinical data have clearly demonstrated that PDE5 inhibitors induce bladder and prostate relaxation, which contributes to the improvement seen in storage symptoms in both animal models of bladder and prostate hypercontractility. Tadalafil is effective both as a monotherapy and add-on therapy in patients with LUTS secondary to BPH. Furthermore, as LUTS-BPH and ED are urological disorders that commonly coexist in aging men, tadalafil is more advantageous than α1-adrenoceptors and should be used as the first option.

Corresponding values for placebo/finasteride coadministration were -2.3, -3.8 and -4.5 (p ≤ 0.022 at all visits favoring tadalafil/finasteride coadministration). I-PSS subscores (storage and voiding) and quality of life index were also numerically improved with tadalafil/finasteride coadministration. Least squares mean changes from baseline in IIEF-EF with tadalafil/finasteride coadministration were 3.7 after 4 weeks, and 4.7 after 12 and 26 weeks. Corresponding values for placebo/finasteride coadministration were -1.1, 0.6 and -0.0 (p 0.001 at all visits favoring tadalafil/finasteride coadministration). Tadalafil/finasteride coadministration was well tolerated and most adverse events were mild/moderate. Conclusions: The coadministration of tadalafil/finasteride provides early improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic enlargement. Tadalafil/finasteride coadministration also improves erectile function in men who have comorbid erectile dysfunction.",0.2386864423751831

Material and methods: A randomized prospective study on patients diagnosed with LUTS secondary to BPH with 50 patients in each group. Duration of the study is 12 weeks. Drug was given 30 min after dinner. Patients were assessed at baseline 1, 4 and 12 weeks with efficacy measures being Maximum flow rate (Qmax), Postvoid residual urine (PVR), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Prostate Symptom Score Quality of life (IPSS QoL) and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) scoring. Statistical analysis was done using paired sample t test and independent sample t test. Results: In tadalafil group, 12 (24%) patients were having mild LUTS and 38 (76%) were having moderate LUTS. In tamsulosin group, 9 (18%) patients were having mild LUTS and 41 (82%) patients were having moderate LUTS. Seventeen patients in tadalafil group had associated ED (erectile dysfunction) and 13 patients had associated ED in tamsulosin group.

Patients and methods: We conducted an integrated analysis of 12 phase II-III randomized, double-blind and/or open-label extension studies to evaluate short-term (12-26 weeks) efficacy and short- and longer-term (42-52 weeks) safety in men aged 75 years vs men aged ≥75 years. All men received once-daily tadalafil 5 mg or placebo. The efficacy outcome was International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Safety measurements included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation, serious AEs (SAEs), and cardiovascular AEs. All analyses were intention-to-treat. Changes from baseline to efficacy endpoint and differences in changes between treatment groups were estimated as least-squares means using analysis of covariance models. Results: Change in the mean IPSS was significantly different in men aged 75 years vs those aged ≥75 years across tadalafil and placebo groups (treatment-by-age interaction P = 0.034). Tadalafil was not statistically significantly better than placebo in men aged ≥75 years, but effect size varied between studies. Maintenance of efficacy with tadalafil was observed across age groups. Short-term tadalafil safety findings for men aged 75 vs ≥75 years included: TEAEs (52 [33.8%] vs 503 [30.1%]), AEs leading to discontinuation (3 [1.9%] vs 50 [3.0%]), SAEs (4 [2.6%] vs 15 [0.9%]) and cardiovascular AEs (4 [2.6%] vs 30 [1.8%]). Long-term tadalafil safety data did not reveal clinically relevant differences between age groups. Limitations include exclusion of men with serious co-existing conditions and limited sample sizes of men aged ≥75 years. Conclusions: Efficacy with once-daily tadalafil 5 mg in the treatment of LUTS/BPH differed between men aged 75 vs ≥75 years, with significant efficacy in the 75-year age group. The older age group had more concomitant diseases and used more drugs, which may have reduced efficacy. The small sample size precluded uni-/multivariate analyses to assess plausible interference from confounding factors. Tadalafil had a reassuring safety profile and no evidence of increased cardiovascular AEs in aging men.",0.11566320806741714
12_h,health_belief,19428174,Does cialis treat enlarged prostrate?,cialis treats enlarged prostrate,1.0,"Background: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and erectile dysfunction (ED) are highly prevalent in aging men and are strongly linked. Alpha₁-blockers such as alfuzosin are effective monotherapies for LUTS. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors such as tadalafil are the first-line treatment for ED. Both drugs act by two different mechanisms of action on common urogenital target organs and, thus, may have additive effects. Objectives: We evaluated in vitro the effects of alfuzosin, tadalafil, and the combination of both on human detrusor and prostatic smooth muscle. Design, setting, and participants: Prostatic and bladder tissue were obtained from patients (n=20 and n=17, respectively) undergoing cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer. Measurements: In organ baths, isolated prostatic strips and isolated bladder strips were incubated with vehicle, tadalafil (10⁻⁶ M and 10⁻⁵ M), alfuzosin (3×10⁻⁸ M or 10⁻⁶ M and 10⁻⁵ M) or a combination. Concentration-response curves (CRCs) to norepinephrine were generated on prostatic strips and detrusor strips precontracted with carbachol. Strips were also submitted to electrical field stimulation (EFS). Results and limitations: When alfuzosin and tadalafil were combined, the maximal relaxation to norepinephrine on carbachol-precontracted detrusor strips was significantly increased compared with tadalafil alone, and EFS-induced detrusor contractions were better inhibited compared with each compound alone. Tadalafil significantly inhibited norepinephrine-induced prostatic strip contractions by reducing the maximal effect, whereas alfuzosin shifted the CRC of norepinephrine to the right. Combining both tadalafil and alfuzosin resulted in a greater relaxant effect. Likewise, the combination was more effective at reducing EFS-induced contractions compared with each compound alone. Conclusions: The combination of alfuzosin and tadalafil exerts an additive effect of inhibiting adrenergic smooth muscle tone of prostatic tissue and EFS-induced detrusor contractions and conversely, of enhancing adrenergic relaxation of detrusor precontracted with carbachol. These experiments provide experimental support for the clinical investigation of the combination of α1-blockers and PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of LUTS.",0.2055453211069107

We post hoc characterized changes in the maximum urinary flow rate using integrated data from 4 international, placebo controlled studies of tadalafil once daily for lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Materials and methods: After a 4-week placebo lead-in period 1,500 men were randomized to tadalafil 5 mg or placebo for 12 weeks. Data were analyzed using ANCOVA. Maximum urinary flow rate values were rank transformed for analysis. Results: Baseline maximum urinary flow rate data were available on 1,371 men with a mean age of 63.1 years and end point data were available on 1,197. Tadalafil 5 mg significantly increased maximum urinary flow vs placebo (median 1.1 vs 0.4 ml per second, p = 0.003). At a baseline voided volume of 125 to less than 250 ml the median change in the maximum urinary flow rate was 0.9 and 1.2 ml per second (p = 0.142) in 731 patients, at a baseline of 250 to 450 ml the change was -0.3 and 0.7 ml per second (p = 0.011) in 428, and at a baseline of greater than 450 ml the change was -0.2 and 2.0 ml per second (p = 0.186) in 38 for placebo and tadalafil, respectively. The difference was 0.3, 1.0 and 2.2 ml per second, respectively. At a baseline maximum urinary flow rate of greater than 15 ml per second in 128 patients the median flow rate change was -2.1 and -0.8 ml per second (p = 0.246), at a maximum of 10 to 15 ml per second in 522 the change was 0.2 and 0.8 ml per second (p = 0.044), and at a maximum of less than 10 ml per second in 547 the change was 1.2 and 1.8 ml per second (p = 0.189) for placebo and tadalafil, respectively.

Methods: An international, randomized, double-blind, parallel study was carried out in men aged ≥45 years who were 5-alpha reductase inhibitor naïve, and had an International Prostate Symptom Score ≥13 and prostate volume ≥30 mL; 350 men received placebo/finasteride and 345 received tadalafil/finasteride over 26 weeks. Treatment satisfaction was assessed per protocol using the Treatment Satisfaction Scale-Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. Responder cut-offs, analyzed post-hoc were total International Prostate Symptom Score improvement ≥3 points or ≥25% from randomization. Results: Baseline patient characteristics were generally comparable between responders and non-responders. The proportion of patients with an International Prostate Symptom Score improvement ≥3 points with tadalafil/finasteride and placebo/finasteride, respectively, at week 4 was 57.0% and 47.9% (OR 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.97), at week 12 was 68.8% and 60.7% (OR 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.07-2.05) and at week 26 was 71.4% and 70.2% (OR 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.81-1.61); for IPSS change ≥25%, the corresponding proportions were 44.8% and 32.9% (OR 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.21-2.28), 55.5% and 51.9% (OR 1.18, 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.62), and 62.0% and 58.3% (OR 1.23, 95% confidence interval 0.89-1.70).

Recent findings: Daily tadalafil, in particular 5 mg, according to retrieved studies, appears to be both safe and effective in treating LUTS/BPH and ED, compared with placebo or tamsulosin. The combination of daily tadalafil 5 mg and tamsulosin 0.4 mg allows a better improvement of LUTS compared with both the monotherapies, even if with an increased, but acceptable and tolerated, adverse events rate. After discontinuation of tamsulosin or tadalafil in patients previously treated with their combination, the improvement of LUTS retains significance compared with baseline. Tadalafil 5 mg should be considered a primary treatment option for patients with LUTS/BPH and ED. Evidence highlight an excellent tolerability, safety, and effectiveness profile, both alone or in combination with tamsulosin 0.4 mg. A better efficacy on LUTS relief has been observed for combination therapy, preserving also sexual function. The further switch to monotherapy allows to preserve LUTS relief, but tadalafil only is able to retain ED improvement.

Only limited data are available on the effect of different food items on tongue coating and halitosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single consumption of food with high fiber content versus low fiber content on halitosis parameters. Based on a randomized clinical cross-over study, 20 subjects were examined over a period of 2.5 hours after consumption of a high-fiber and a low-fiber meal. The determination of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) was performed using a Halimeter, and the organoleptic assessment of halitosis was done on the basis of a distance index. The tongue coating was determined using a modified Winkel index, and the mouth sensation was evaluated subjectively by the subjects. In both the test and the control phase, a statistically significant reduction of all selected parameters was detected (p 0.05). Only for the organoleptic assessment of halitosis was a statistically significantly higher reduction found after consumption of a high-fiber meal compared to the control meal (p 0.05). In conclusion, the consumption of the meals in this study resulted in an at least 2.5-hour reduction of oral halitosis.

13_h,health_belief,18388413,Does diet cause bad breathe?,diet causes bad breathe,1.0,"Many food products are claimed to be effective in controlling halitosis. Halitosis is caused mainly by volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) such as H(2)S and CH(3)SH produced in the oral cavity. Oral microorganisms degrade proteinaceous substrates to cysteine and methionine, which are then converted to VSCs. Most treatments for halitosis focus on controlling the number of microorganisms in the oral cavity. Since tea polyphenols have been shown to have antimicrobial and deodorant effects, we have investigated whether green tea powder reduces VSCs in mouth air, and compared its effectiveness with that of other foods which are claimed to control halitosis. Immediately after administering the products, green tea showed the largest reduction in concentration of both H(2)S and CH(3)SH gases, especially CH(3)SH which also demonstrated a better correlation with odor strength than H(2)S; however, no reduction was observed at 1, 2 and 3 h after administration. Chewing gum, mints and parsley-seed oil product did not reduce the concentration of VSCs in mouth air at any time. Toothpaste, mints and green tea strongly inhibited VSCs production in a saliva-putrefaction system, but chewing gum and parsley-seed oil product could not inhibit saliva putrefaction. Toothpaste and green tea also demonstrated strong deodorant activities in vitro, but no significant deodorant activity of mints, chewing gum or parsley-seed oil product were observed. We concluded that green tea was very effective in reducing oral malodor temporarily because of its disinfectant and deodorant activities, whereas other foods were not effective.",0.16606879234313965

Therefore, it is important to study deodorization techniques for garlic breath. The volatiles responsible for garlic breath include diallyl disulfide, allyl mercaptan, allyl methyl disulfide, and allyl methyl sulfide. After eating garlic, water (control), raw, juiced or heated apple, raw or heated lettuce, raw or juiced mint leaves, or green tea were consumed immediately. The levels of the garlic volatiles on the breath were analyzed from 1 to 60 min by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). Garlic was also blended with water (control), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), rosemarinic acid, quercetin or catechin, and the volatiles in the headspace analyzed from 3 to 40 min by SIFT-MS. Raw apple, raw lettuce, and mint leaves significantly decreased all of the garlic breath volatiles in vivo. The proposed mechanism is enzymatic deodorization where volatiles react with phenolic compounds. Apple juice and mint juice also had a deodorizing effect on most of the garlic volatiles but were generally not as effective as the raw food, probably because the juice had enzymatic activity but the phenolic compounds had already polymerized. Both heated apple and heated lettuce produced a significant reduction of diallyl disulfide and allyl mercaptan. The presence of phenolic compounds that react with the volatile compounds even in the absence of enzymes is the most likely mechanism.

Olfaction is the most ancient of our distal senses and may be used to evaluate food and environmental toxins as well as recognize kin and potential predators. Many body odors evolved to be olfactory messengers, which convey information between individuals. Consequently, those practicing the healing arts have used olfaction to aid in their diagnosis of disease since the dawn of medical practice. Studies using modern instrumental analyses have focused upon analysis of breath volatiles for biomarkers of internal diseases.

While the risk of these conditions is thought to be greatest during the third trimester of pregnancy, the determinants of fetoplacental susceptibility to infection, the contribution of gestational age, and the in vivo progression of disease at the maternal-fetal interface are poorly understood. We developed a nonhuman primate model of listeriosis to better understand antecedents of adverse pregnancy outcomes in early pregnancy. Four pregnant cynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ) received a single intragastric inoculation between days 36 and 46 of gestation with 10<sup>7</sup> CFU of an L. monocytogenes strain isolated from a previous cluster of human listeriosis cases that resulted in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Fecal shedding, maternal bacteremia, and fetal demise were consistently noted within 7 to 13 days. Biopsy specimens of maternal liver, spleen, and lymph node displayed variable inflammation and relatively low bacterial burden. In comparison, we observed greater bacterial burden in the decidua and placenta and the highest burden in fetal tissues. Histopathology indicated vasculitis, fibrinoid necrosis, and thrombosis of the decidual spiral arteries, acute chorioamnionitis and villitis in the placenta, and hematogenous infection of the fetus. Vascular pathology suggests early impact of L. monocytogenes infection on spiral arteries in the decidua, which we hypothesize precipitates subsequent placentitis and fetal demise. These results demonstrate that L. monocytogenes tropism for the maternal reproductive tract results in infection of the decidua, placenta, and the fetus itself during the first trimester of pregnancy. IMPORTANCE Although listeriosis is known to cause significant fetal morbidity and mortality, it is typically recognized in the third trimester of human pregnancy. Its impact on early pregnancy is poorly defined. Here we provide evidence that exposure to L. monocytogenes in the first trimester poses a greater risk of fetal loss than currently appreciated. Similarities in human and nonhuman primate placentation, physiology, and reproductive immunology make this work highly relevant to human pregnancy. We highlight the concept that the maternal immune response that protects the mother from serious disease is unable to protect the fetus, a concept relevant to classic TORCH (<underline>t</underline>oxoplasmosis, <underline>o</underline>ther, <underline>r</underline>ubella, <underline>c</underline>ytomegalovirus, and <underline>h</underline>erpes) infections and newly illuminated by current Zika virus outbreaks. Studies with this model, using the well-understood organism L. monocytogenes , will permit precise analysis of host-pathogen interactions at the maternal-fetal interface and have broad significance to both recognized and emerging infections in the setting of pregnancy.",0.18544799089431763

Personal opposition to perineal examination has been overcome by the use of vaginal self-sampling. Here, we review the use of this procedure notably in low-income countries and the main infectious causes of miscarriage. Vaginal self-sampling was mainly used for human papillomavirus detection but also to detect microorganisms causing sexually transmitted infections or bacterial vaginosis. 58 studies have been performed in low-resource countries, mainly studies performed to detect human papillomavirus in urban and peri-urban areas and demonstrating excellent acceptability. Several infectious causes of miscarriage could be tested using self-vaginal samples. In the future, such strategies coupled with a rapid-identification point-of-care method could allow the development of screening and treatment programs in rural areas in low-resource countries.",0.47028347849845886

Queen Anne (1655-1714) underwent 18 pregnancies without producing any successors, probably because the children died of perinatal infection. Some women are unable to produce a specific IgG-antibody against Group B streptococcus (GBS). They may have normal IgM production and are thereby self-protected, while their infants risk developing neonatal GBS septicaemia. Listeria monocytogenes may cause repeated miscarriages, stillbirths and neonatal infections and, even today, is an important cause of perinatal deaths. The miscarriages and neonatal deaths of Queen Anne are believed to have been caused by an asymptomatic listeria monocytogenes infection. The importance of recognizing women at risk for these types of infections is discussed.",0.08904509991407394

The objective of this study was to detect the prevalence, serotypes, antimicrobial susceptibility and virulence factors of L. monocytogenes isolated from pregnant women with vaginitis at a tertiary care hospital in Tehran, Iran. Materials and methods: During September 2015 to February 2017, a total of 400 vaginal swabs were collected from pregnant women. The presumptive isolates were characterized biochemically. All L. monocytogenes isolates were further analyzed by serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility tests. All positive samples for L. monocytogenes were analyzed for presence of virulence genes ( hly A, act A, inl A, inl C, inl J and prf A). Results: Twenty-two (5.5%) of the samples were found positive for presence of L. monocytogenes. Most isolates are resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (81.82%) and chloramphenicol (54.55%). The majority of tested isolates (59.10%) belonged to serotype 4b, followed by 1/2a (22.73%), 1/2b (13.63%), and 3c (4.54%). The hly A, act A and inl A were detected in all of the 22 L. monocytogenes isolates, but two, three and five isolates were found to lack inl C, inl J and prf A, respectively. Only one isolate lacked three inl C, inl J and prf A genes, and two isolates simultaneously lacked both inl J and prf A genes. Conclusion: Evaluation of virulence factors and antimicrobial susceptibility can be highly helpful to develop effective treatment strategies against L. monocytogenes infections. This study is noteworthy in that it documents prevalence, virulence characteristics, and antimicrobial resistance of L. monocytogenes .",0.46011489629745483
14_h,health_belief,21884294,Does listeria cause miscarriage?,listeria causes miscarriage,1.0,"This review considers the role of intracellular bacteria in adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as miscarriage, stillbirths, and preterm labour. The cause of miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm labour often remains unexplained. Intracellular bacteria that grow either poorly or not at all on media used routinely to detect human pathogens could be the aetiological agents of these obstetric conditions. For example, Listeria monocytogenes and Coxiella burnetti are intracellular bacteria that have a predilection for the fetomaternal unit and may induce fatal disease in the mother and/or fetus. Both are important foodborne or zoonotic pathogens in pregnancy. Preventive measures, diagnostic tools and treatment will be reviewed. Moreover, we will also address the importance in adverse pregnancy outcomes of other intracellular bacteria, including Brucella abortus and various members of the order Chlamydiales. Indeed, there is growing evidence that Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia abortus and Chlamydia pneumoniae infections may also result in adverse pregnancy outcomes in humans and/or animals. Moreover, newly discovered Chlamydia-like organisms have recently emerged as new pathogens of both animals and humans. For example, Waddlia chondrophila, a Chlamydia-related bacterium isolated from aborted bovine fetuses, has also been implicated in human miscarriages. Future research should help us to better understand the pathophysiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes caused by intracellular bacteria and to determine the precise mode of transmission of newly identified bacteria, such as Waddlia and Parachlamydia. These emerging pathogens may represent the tip of the iceberg of a large number of as yet unknown intracellular pathogenic agents.",0.14207379519939423

Its main virulence factor is listeriolysin O (LLO), a pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC), which enables bacterial escape from the phagolysosome and contributes to bacterial pathogenicity. Details of cholesterol (Chol) recognition and membrane binding mechanisms by LLO are still not known. Here we used <sup>19</sup>F-NMR spectroscopy in order to assess LLO-Chol interactions in solution and in a Chol-rich membrane environment. LLO has six tryptophan residues located in the region of the molecule that is first in contact with lipid membranes. <sup>19</sup>F-LLO, which contained 5-fluoro-tryptophans, was prepared by using isotopic labelling in an E. coli expression system. Signals in the <sup>19</sup>F-NMR spectrum of <sup>19</sup>F-LLO were unambiguously assigned by using a series of single Trp → Phe point mutations. The results employing various cholesterol preparations in solution indicate that tryptophan residues are not directly involved in Chol binding in solution. However, significant chemical shift changes were observed upon LLO binding to Chol-rich membranes, highlighting the role of tryptophan residues in membrane interactions (W512) and oligomerisation (W189 and W489).",0.2475740909576416

In pregnant women foodborne infection can give rise to infection of the fetus resulting in miscarriage. In addition, the bacterium has recently been demonstrated to cause localized gastrointestinal symptoms, predominantly in immunocompetent individuals. The murine model of systemic L. monocytogenes infection has provided numerous insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis of this organism. However, recent application of transcriptomic and proteomic approaches as well as the development of new model systems has allowed a focus upon factors that influence adaptation to gastrointestinal environments and adhesion to and invasion of the gastrointestinal mucosa. In addition, the availability of a large number of complete L. monocytogenes genome sequences has permitted inter-strain comparisons and the identification of factors that may influence the emergence of 'epidemic' phenotypes.
