In the past, its use was widespread in dermatological disorders such as acne vulgaris, rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff, pityriasis versicolor, scabies, and warts. Adverse events associated with topically applied sulfur are rare and mainly involve mild application site reactions. Sulfur, used alone or in combination with agents such as sodium sulfacetamide or salicylic acid, has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of many dermatological conditions."
2_h,health_belief,20620757,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"The effect of sugars on aging skin is governed by the simple act of covalently cross-linking two collagen fibers, which renders both of them incapable of easy repair. Glucose and fructose link the amino acids present in the collagen and elastin that support the dermis, producing advanced glycation end products or ""AGEs."" This process is accelerated in all body tissues when sugar is elevated and is further stimulated by ultraviolet light in the skin. The effect on vascular, renal, retinal, coronary, and cutaneous tissues is being defined, as are methods of reducing the glycation load through careful diet and use of supplements."

Treatment options include cosmeceuticals, laser rejuvenation, chemical peels, and microdermabrasion. Preventing the effects of extrinsic aging involves using sunscreen-the right product, used in the right amount, at the right time, in the right places."
2_h,health_belief,17951030,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"Smoking tobacco is the most preventable cause of morbidity and is responsible for more than three million deaths a year worldwide. In addition to a strong association with a number of systemic diseases, smoking is also associated with many dermatological conditions, including poor wound healing, premature skin aging, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, oral cancer, acne, psoriasis, and hair loss. This review focuses on the effects of smoking on premature skin aging. It has been long established that smoking has deleterious effects on skin. Epidemiological studies indicate that smoking is an important environmental factor in premature skin aging. In vitro studies indicate that tobacco smoke extract impairs the production of collagen and increases the production of tropoelastin and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), which degrade matrix proteins, and also causes an abnormal production of elastosis material. Smoking increases MMP levels, which leads to the degradation of collagen, elastic fibers, and proteoglycans, suggesting an imbalance between biosynthesis and degradation in dermal connective tissue metabolism. Reactive oxygen species are also involved in tobacco smoke-induced premature skin aging. Scavengers of reactive oxygen species ameliorate the induction of MMP. Tobacco smoke extract also impacts dermal connective tissue in nude mice. Thus, in vitro and in vivo evidence indicates that smoking tobacco leads to accelerated aging of the skin. These findings might be useful to motivate those patients who are more concerned about their appearance than the potential internal damage associated with smoking to stop smoking."
2_h,health_belief,10338266,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"During her lifetime, a woman faces the possibility of seeking dermatological assistance for a myriad of conditions, including acne, rosacea, striae, photodamage, and skin cancers. It is important for clinicians and patients to be aware of the symptoms of these conditions as well as the most beneficial approaches for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management. The life expectancy of women has increased and predictions for the year 2050 estimate the average age at 81 years. This will place women at greater risk for dermatological problems, especially photodamage and skin cancer. In addition, various ethnic groups may manifest these conditions differently. Although acne is most prevalent among teenaged males, most can expect clearing by age 25. Females may continue to experience acne into the adult years, sometimes beyond the age of 40. Although it is not a life-threatening disease, acne may have psychosocial and quality-of-life consequences. Treatments for acne can be topical or systemic, and include retinoids, antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and hormonal therapy. Rosacea is more common in women (especially during menopause) than in men. It is a chronic condition that can cause complications, including telangiectasia, conjunctivitis, and blepharitis. Although there is no cure, rosacea can be managed and controlled with medication. Topical antibiotics, such as metronidazole, and systemic antibiotics, such as tetracycline, clarithromycin, and doxycycline, are used to manage rosacea. Striae, or stretch marks, occur most frequently in pregnant women, adolescents experiencing growth spurts, weight lifters, and the obese. Although not a health threat, they can be psychologically distressing. There are not many treatment options for striae, but topical tretinoin and the pulsed dye laser offer promising results. Intrinsic, or normal, aging of the skin results from the process of chronological aging. Photodamage is skin damage caused by chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. It is the leading cause of extrinsic aging, or alterations of the skin due to environmental exposure. Estimates indicate that almost half of a person's UV exposure occurs by age 18. Photoaging causes numerous histologic, physiologic, and clinical changes; it also increases the risk for skin cancer. Photodamage can be prevented through the use of sun screens, protective clothing, and avoidance of the sun during peak intensity time. The only product approved by the FDA for the treatment of photodamage (fine wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, and skin roughness), topical tretinoin emollient cream, may help prevent additional photoaging when it is used to treat existing photoaging. Other management options for photodamaged skin include alpha-hydroxy acids, antioxidants, antiandrogens, moisturizers, and exfoliants. In patients with excessive manifestations of photodamage, surgical management may be needed, including dermabrasion, chemical peels, soft tissue augmentation, laser resurfacing, botulism toxin, and Gortex threads. Clinicians must educate their patients about the most appropriate skin care regimen as well as approaches for preventing and treating common afflictions. In this way, women will have the best opportunity for having and maintaining healthy skin."
2_h,health_belief,15492432,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"Skin aging appears to be the result of both scheduled and continuous ""wear and tear"" processes that damage cellular DNA and proteins. Two types of aging, chronological skin aging and photoaging, have distinct clinical and histological features. Chronological skin aging is a universal and inevitable process characterized primarily by physiologic alterations in skin function. In this case, keratinocytes are unable to properly terminally differentiate to form a functional stratum corneum, and the rate of formation of neutral lipids that contribute to the barrier function slows, causing dry, pale skin with fine wrinkles. In contrast, photoaging results from the UVR of sunlight and the damage thus becomes apparent in sun-exposed skin. Characteristics of this aging type are dry and sallow skin displaying fine wrinkles as well as deep furrows, resulting from the disorganization of epidermal and dermal components associated with elastosis and heliodermatitis. Understanding of the functions of the skin and the basic principles of moisturizer use and application is important for the prevention of skin aging. Successful treatment of dry skin with appropriate skin care products gives the impression of eternal youth."
2_h,health_belief,27224842,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"First described in the context of diabetes, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed through a type of non-enzymatic reaction called glycation. Increased accumulation of AGEs in human tissue has now been associated with end stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and, recently, skin aging. Characteristic findings of aging skin, including decreased resistance to mechanical stress, impaired wound healing, and distorted dermal vasculature, can be in part attributable to glycation. Multiple factors mediate cutaneous senescence, and these factors are generally characterized as endogenous (e.g., telomere shortening) or exogenous (e.g., ultraviolet radiation exposure). Interestingly, AGEs exert their pathophysiological effects from both endogenous and exogenous routes. The former entails the consumption of sugar in the diet, which then covalently binds an electron from a donor molecule to form an AGE. The latter process mostly refers to the formation of AGEs through cooking. Recent studies have revealed that certain methods of food preparation (i.e., grilling, frying, and roasting) produce much higher levels of AGEs than water-based cooking methods such as boiling and steaming. Moreover, several dietary compounds have emerged as promising candidates for the inhibition of glycation-mediated aging. In this review, we summarize the evidence supporting the critical role of glycation in skin aging and highlight preliminary studies on dietary strategies that may be able to combat this process."

It has become imperative for the plastic surgeon to know and understand the causes of aging and skin damage and to provide ancillary nonsurgical treatments through which their patients can achieve rejuvenation.
2_h,health_belief,20120419,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"It is believed that oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen and a biological system's ability to neutralize the reactive intermediates. Oxidative damage occurs because of both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Together, intrinsic and extrinsic damage are the primary causes of skin aging. The skin uses a series of intrinsic antioxidants to protect itself from free radical damage. Naturally occurring extrinsic antioxidants have also been widely shown to offset and alleviate these changes. Unlike sunscreens, which have an SPF rating system to guide consumers in their purchases, there is no widely accepted method to choose antioxidant anti-aging products. ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) and ABEL-RAC (Analysis By Emitted Light-Relative Antioxidant Capacity), are both accepted worldwide as a standard measure of the antioxidant capacity of foods, and are rating systems that could be applied to all antioxidant skincare products. The standardization of antioxidant creams could revolutionize the cosmeceutical market and give physicians and consumers the ability to compare and choose effectively."
2_h,health_belief,22773133,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"Efforts to employ various types of plasma in the field of skin care have increased consistently because it can regulate many biochemical reactions that are normally unaffected by light-based therapy. One method for skin rejuvenation adopted a high-temperature plasma generator to remove skin epithelial cells. In this case, the catalyzing effects of the plasma were rarely used due to the high temperature. Hence, the benefits of the plasma were not magnified. Recently, many types of low-temperature plasma devices have been developed for medical applications but their detailed functions and working mechanisms are unclear. The present study examined the effect of low-temperature microwave plasma on skin cells. Treatment with low-temperature plasma increased the expression of anti-aging genes in skin cells, including collagen, fibronectin and vascular endothelial growth factor. Furthermore, the plasma treatment did not cause cell death, but only induced slight cell growth arrest at the G2 phase. Although the cells treated with low-temperature plasma showed moderate growth arrest, there were no signs of thermal or genetic damage of skin cells. Overall, this low-temperature microwave plasma device induces the expressions of some anti-aging-related genes in skin cells without causing damage."

Skin aging affects patients physically and physiologically. Understanding the process of skin aging can provide new knowledge on how to attenuate or reduce skin disorder symptoms. Herbs have been used for ages to prevent and treat skin aging, yet there are growing interests by researchers in this field globally. Various strategies have been developed for improving the quality and effectivity of herbal skin care products, both for topical and oral applications. This review will provide an overview of the relationship between herbal skin care products and the skin aging process."
3_h,health_belief,29876931,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"To ensure their high proliferation rate, tumor cells have an iron metabolic disorder causing them to have increased iron needs, making them more susceptible to iron deprivation. This vulnerability could be a therapeutic target. In breast cancers, the development of new therapeutic approaches is urgently needed for patients with triple-negative tumors, which frequently relapse after chemotherapy and suffer from a lack of targeted therapies. In this study, we demonstrated that deferasirox (DFX) synergises with standard chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin, cisplatin and carboplatin to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis and autophagy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Moreover, the combination of DFX with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide delayed recurrences in breast cancer patient-derived xenografts without increasing the side-effects of chemotherapies alone or altering the global iron storage of mice. Antitumor synergy of DFX and doxorubicin seems to involve downregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and nuclear factor-κB pathways. Iron deprivation in combination with chemotherapy could thus help to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy in TNBC patients without increasing toxicity.

3_h,health_belief,20204499,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"Multigene assays have been developed and validated to determine the prognosis of breast cancer. In this study, we assessed the additional predictive value of the 70-gene MammaPrint signature for chemotherapy (CT) benefit in addition to endocrine therapy (ET) from pooled study series. For 541 patients who received either ET (n = 315) or ET + CT (n = 226), breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and distant disease-free survival (DDFS) at 5 years were assessed separately for the 70-gene high and low risk groups. The 70-gene signature classified 252 patients (47%) as low risk and 289 (53%) as high risk. Within the 70-gene low risk group, BCSS was 97% for the ET group and 99% for the ET + CT group at 5 years with a non-significant univariate hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 (95% CI 0.07-4.98; P = 0.62). In the 70-gene high risk group, BCSS was 81% (ET group) and 94% (ET + CT group) at 5 years with a significant HR of 0.21 (95% CI 0.07-0.59; P 0.01). DDFS was 93% (ET) versus 99% (ET + CT), respectively, in the 70-gene low risk group, HR 0.26 (95% CI 0.03-2.02; P = 0.20). In the high risk group DDFS was 76 versus 88%, HR of 0.35 (95% CI 0.17-0.71; P 0.01). Results were similar in multivariate analysis, showing significant survival benefit by adding CT in the 70-gene high risk group. A significant and clinically meaningful benefit was observed by adding chemotherapy to endocrine treatment in 70-gene high risk patients. This benefit was not significant in low risk patients, who were at such low risk for recurrence and cancer-related death, that adding CT does not appear to be clinically meaningful."
3_h,health_belief,21042932,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"Pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant treatment correlates with outcome in breast cancer. We determined whether characteristics of neoadjuvant therapy are associated with pCR. We used multi-level models, which accounted for heterogeneity in pCR across trials and trial arms, to analyze individual patient data from 3332 women included in 7 German neoadjuvant trials with uniform protocols. PCR was associated with an increase in number of chemotherapy cycles (odds ratio [OR] 1.2 for every two additional cycles; P = 0.009), with higher cumulative anthracycline doses (OR 1.6; P = 0.002), higher cumulative taxane doses (OR 1.6; P = 0.009), and with capecitabine containing regimens (OR 1.62; P = 0.022). Association of pCR with increase in number of cycles appeared more pronounced in hormone receptor (HR)-positive tumors (OR 1.35) than in HR-negative tumors (OR 1.04; P for interaction = 0.046). Effect of anthracycline dose was particularly pronounced in HER2-negative tumors (OR 1.61), compared to HER2-positive tumors (OR 0.83; P for interaction = 0.14). Simultaneous trastuzumab treatment in HER2-positive tumors increased odds of pCR 3.2-fold (P 0.001). No association of pCR and number of trastuzumab cycles was found (OR 1.20, P = 0.39). Dosing characteristics appear important for successful treatment of breast cancer. Longer treatment, higher cumulative doses of anthracyclines and taxanes, and the addition of capecitabine and trastuzumab are associated with better response. Tailoring according to breast cancer phenotype might be possible: longer treatment in HR-positive tumors, higher cumulative anthracycline doses for HER2-negative tumors, shorter treatment at higher cumulative doses for triple-negative tumors, and limited number of preoperative trastuzumab cycles in HER2-positive tumors."
3_h,health_belief,22198468,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer allows individual tumor response to be assessed depending on molecular subtype, and to judge the impact of response to therapy on recurrence-free survival (RFS). The multicenter I-SPY 1 TRIAL evaluated patients with ≥ 3 cm tumors by using early imaging and molecular signatures, with outcomes of pathologic complete response (pCR) and RFS. The current analysis was performed using data from patients who had molecular profiles and did not receive trastuzumab. The various molecular classifiers tested were highly correlated. Categorization of breast cancer by molecular signatures enhanced the ability of pCR to predict improvement in RFS compared to the population as a whole. In multivariate analysis, the molecular signatures that added to the ability of HR and HER2 receptors, clinical stage, and pCR in predicting RFS included 70-gene signature, wound healing signature, p53 mutation signature, and PAM50 risk of recurrence. The low risk signatures were associated with significantly better prognosis, and also identified additional patients with a good prognosis within the no pCR group, primarily in the hormone receptor positive, HER-2 negative subgroup. The I-SPY 1 population is enriched for tumors with a poor prognosis but is still heterogeneous in terms of rates of pCR and RFS. The ability of pCR to predict RFS is better by subset than it is for the whole group. Molecular markers improve prediction of RFS by identifying additional patients with excellent prognosis within the no pCR group."
3_h,health_belief,27394134,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"The purpose of this study was to conduct an exploratory analysis of the START examining the effects of resistance exercise training (RET) and aerobic exercise training (AET) on sarcopenia, dynapenia, and associated quality of life (QoL) changes in breast cancer (BC) patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Participants were randomized to usual care (UC) (n = 70), AET (n = 64), or RET (n = 66) for the duration of chemotherapy. Measures of sarcopenia [skeletal muscle index (SMI)] and dynapenia [upper extremity (UE) and lower extremity (LE) muscle dysfunction (MD)] were normalized relative to age-/sex-based clinical cut-points. QoL was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) scales. At baseline, 25.5 % of BC patients were sarcopenic and 54.5 % were dynapenic with both conditions associated with poorer QoL. ANCOVAs showed significant differences favoring RET over UC for SMI (0.32 kg/m(2); p = 0.017), UE-MD (0.12 kg/kg; p 0.001), and LE-MD (0.27 kg/kg; p 0.001). Chi-square analyses revealed significant effects of RET, compared to UC/AET combined, on reversing sarcopenia (p = 0.039) and dynapenia (p = 0.019). The reversal of sarcopenia was associated with clinically relevant improvements in the FACT-An (11.7 points [95 % confidence interval (CI) -4.2 to 27.6]), the Trial Outcome Index-Anemia (10.0 points [95 % CI -4.0 to 24.1]), and fatigue (5.3 points [95 % CI -1.5 to 12.1]). Early-stage BC patients initiating adjuvant chemotherapy have higher than expected rates of sarcopenia and dynapenia which are associated with poorer QoL. RET during adjuvant chemotherapy resulted in the reversal of both sarcopenia and dynapenia; however, only the reversal of sarcopenia was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in QoL."
3_h,health_belief,20690040,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"Brain gray matter alterations have been reported in cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of breast cancer patients after cancer treatment. Here we report the first prospective MRI study of women undergoing treatment for breast cancer, with or without chemotherapy, as well as healthy controls. We hypothesized that chemotherapy-associated changes in gray matter density would be detectable 1 month after treatment, with partial recovery 1 year later. Participants included breast cancer patients treated with (CTx+, N = 17) or without (CTx-, N = 12) chemotherapy and matched healthy controls (N = 18). MRI scans were acquired at baseline (after surgery but before radiation, chemotherapy, and/or anti-estrogen treatment), 1 month after completion of chemotherapy (M1), and 1 year later (Y1). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to evaluate gray matter density differences between groups and over time. There were no between-group gray matter differences at baseline. Group-by-time interactions showed declines from baseline to M1 in both cancer groups relative to controls. Within-group analyses indicated that at M1 relative to baseline the CTx+ group had decreased gray matter density in bilateral frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions and right thalamus. Recovery was seen at Y1 in some regions, although persistent decreases were also apparent. No significant within-group changes were found in the CTx- or control groups. Findings were not attributable to recency of cancer surgery, disease stage, psychiatric symptoms, psychotropic medication use, or hormonal treatment status. This study is the first to use a prospective, longitudinal approach to document decreased brain gray matter density shortly after breast cancer chemotherapy and its course of recovery over time. These gray matter alterations appear primarily related to the effects of chemotherapy, rather than solely reflecting host factors, the cancer disease process, or effects of other cancer treatments."
3_h,health_belief,12353813,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"Background: Previous reports suggest that problems in sexual functioning may be common among long-term (&gt; 5 years) breast cancer survivors. To investigate this issue further, we examined the characteristics and correlates of sexual functioning in women diagnosed with breast cancer at least 5 years previously and treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and in an age-matched comparison group of women with no history of cancer. Patients and methods: Participants were 58 women initially diagnosed with breast cancer at an average of 7.65 years previously and 61 women with no history of cancer. All participants completed standardized self-report measures of sexual functioning, marital functioning, depression, fatigue, and menopausal symptoms. Results: Compared with women with no history of cancer, long-term breast cancer survivors reported worse sexual functioning (P or = 0.01), characterized by greater lack of sexual interest, inability to relax and enjoy sex, difficulty becoming aroused, and difficulty achieving an orgasm. Additional analyses indicated that severity of vaginal dryness was significantly (P or = 0.05) related to poorer sexual functioning among long-term breast cancer survivors and mediated the relationship between group membership (breast cancer survivor v.s. noncancer comparison subject) and sexual functioning. Conclusions: These findings confirm and extend previous reports of impaired sexual functioning among long-term breast cancer survivors. Results further suggest that relief of vaginal dryness should be an essential component of efforts to improve sexual functioning among long-term breast cancer survivors."
3_h,health_belief,27510185,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common toxicity associated with chemotherapy, but researchers rarely study its risk factors, fall risk, and prevalence in long-term breast cancer survivors. We aimed to determine CIPN prevalence, risk factors, and association with psychological distress and falls among long-term breast cancer survivors. We conducted Cross-sectional analyses among postmenopausal women with a history of stage I-III breast cancer who received taxane-based chemotherapy. Participants reported neuropathic symptoms of tingling/numbness in hands and/or feet on a 0-10 numerical rating scale. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to evaluate risk factors associated with the presence of CIPN and the relationship between CIPN and anxiety, depression, insomnia, and patient-reported falls. Among 296 participants, 173 (58.4 %) reported CIPN symptoms, 91 (30.7 %) rated their symptoms as mild, and 82 (27.7 %) rated them moderate to severe. Compared with women of normal weight, being obese was associated with increased risk of CIPN (adjusted OR 1.94, 95 % CI: 1.03-3.65). Patients with CIPN reported greater insomnia severity, anxiety, and depression than those without (all p 0.05). Severity of CIPN was associated with higher rates of falls, with 23.8, 31.9, and 41.5 % in the ""no CIPN,"" ""mild,"" and ""moderate-to-severe"" groups, respectively, experiencing falls (p = 0.028). The majority of long-term breast cancer survivors who received taxane-based chemotherapy reported CIPN symptoms; obesity was a significant risk factor. Those with CIPN also reported increased psychological distress and falls. Interventions need to target CIPN and comorbid psychological symptoms, and incorporate fall prevention strategies for aging breast cancer survivors."
3_h,health_belief,21811816,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"Several adverse effects of chemotherapy treatments have been described, and most of these effects are associated with direct interactions between blood cells and indirect effects generated during the oxidative metabolism of antineoplastic drugs. In this study we evaluated the oxidative systemic status and hematological profiles of breast cancer patients with advanced ductal infiltrative carcinoma treated with doxorubicin (DOX) or paclitaxel (PTX) within 1 h after chemotherapy. Blood analyses included evaluation of hemogram, pro-oxidative markers, and antioxidant status. The results showed that advanced breast cancer diseased (AD) patients without previous chemotherapy presented anemia and high oxidative stress status characterized by elevated levels of lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide, and reduced catalase activity when compared with controls. DOX-treated patients exhibited increased anemia and reduced antioxidant status, which was revealed by decreases in reduced glutathione levels and the total antioxidant capacity of plasma; however, these changes did not lead to further increases in lipid peroxidation or carbonyl proteins when compared with the AD group. PTX-treated patients also showed increased anemia, lactate dehydrogenase leakage, and enhanced lipid peroxidation. These data reveal for the first time that patients subjected to chemotherapy with DOX or PTX present immediate systemic oxidative stress and red blood cell oxidative injury with anemia development. These findings provide a new perspective on the systemic redox state of AD and patients subjected to chemotherapy regarding oxidative stress enhancement and its possible involvement in the aggravation of chronic anemia."
3_h,health_belief,17443560,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"Background: Short term side-effects of chemotherapy include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, mucositis and myelosuppression or neutropenia. These occur during the course of treatment and generally resolve within months of completion of chemotherapy. A variety of Chinese medicinal herbs have been used for managing these side effects. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs in alleviating chemotherapy-induced short term side effects in breast cancer patients. Search strategy: We searched The Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register (15/02/2007), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1966 to December 2006); EMBASE (1990 to December 2006); and Chinese Biomedical Literature (2006, Issue 4). A number of journals were hand searched. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing chemotherapy with or without Chinese herbs in women with breast cancer. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted the data, which were analysed using RevMan 4.2. For dichotomous data, we estimated the relative risk. For continuous data, we calculated the weighted mean difference. Main results: We identified seven randomised controlled trials involving 542 breast cancer patients undergoing or having recently undergone chemotherapy. All studies were conducted and published in China. We did not pool the results because few studies were identified and no more than two used the same intervention. All were of low quality and used CMH plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone.CMH combined with chemotherapy showed no statistically significant difference for the outcomes of phlebitis and alopecia. Only one study showed an improvement in nausea and vomiting, and in fatigue. Three indicated an improvement in white blood cells in the group receiving CMH. Two showed an increase in percentage changes in T-lymphocyte subsets CD4 and CD8. One study showed a statistically significant difference for CMH in percentage changes in T-lymphocyte subsets CD3, CD4 and CD8. Two herbal compounds may have improved quality of life. One study reported that CMH may have some effect on reducing toxicity in liver and kidney, but differences were not statistically significant. Authors' conclusions: This review provides limited evidence about the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs in alleviating chemotherapy induced short term side effects. Chinese medicinal herbs, when used together with chemotherapy, may offer some benefit to breast cancer patients in terms of bone marrow improvement and quality of life, but the evidence is too limited to make any confident conclusions. Well designed clinical trials are required before any conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness and safety of CHM in the management of breast cancer patients."

This study aimed to examine how frequently the link between HPV and oral cancer has been reported in the news press and to examine the content of these articles. Design: UK media articles were searched for articles relating to oral cancer and HPV in the database NexisUK. Of 854 articles identified by the initial search, 112 were eligible for inclusion (2002-2014) and content analysis was used to determine the main themes discussed. Results: Themes included actor Michael Douglas' claim that his throat cancer was caused by HPV, the riskiness of oral sex, health information (including HPV as a cause of oral cancer) and the need to vaccinate boys against HPV. Many articles also referred to the link between HPV and cervical cancer and the increasing incidence of HPV-related oral cancer. The largest peak in articles occurred when Michael Douglas discussed his cancer (June 2013). Facts about HPV and references to research were provided in some articles. Conclusions: The link between HPV and oral cancer and the transmission of HPV via oral sex was regularly discussed, yet coverage often lacked detailed health information. This could increase awareness of the link between oral sex and HPV risk, but may also lead to public concern about oral sex as a sexual behaviour."

We performed this meta-analysis to ascertain whether oral sex is a risk factor or a risk marker for oral cancer. Method: The PubMed database was searched up to 30 August 2013 (latest updated on 21 December 2014) for relevant observational studies that tested the association between oral sex and oral cancer risk. After data extraction from eligible studies, the meta-analysis was conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Results: Finally we yielded six case-control studies and one cross-sectional study with 5553 individuals. The results based on random-effects model indicated that there was no significant association between oral sex and risk of oral cancer (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.54; P = 0.33). Sensitivity analysis showed that the result was robust and subgroups analyses also revealed similar results. Publication bias was not detected. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that oral sex is a risk marker rather than an independent risk factor for oral cancer. However, the practitioners should assure they are without sexually transmitted diseases and with good oral health, and at least cleaned carefully and thoroughly before oral sex."

Just like tobacco and alcohol, Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is now recognized to play a role in the pathogenesis of a subset of HNSCCs. Unprotected sexual behaviours with the HPV carrier plays an important role in transmission of this virus. The global incidence of head and neck cancers is declining, but the incidence of HPV related head and neck cancers is rapidly increasing over the last few decades. However, most institutions do not mandate documentation of sexual history or counselling of patients regarding sexual practices like they do for tobacco and alcohol addictions in HNSCC patients. The aim of this review of literature is to analyse if there is a strong evidence to correlate oral sex with HPV related HNSCC and counsel the patient's regarding sexual behaviours."
4_h,health_belief,27642003,Does oral sex cause throat cancer?,oral sex causes throat cancer,1.0,"Objectives: This systematic review identified and evaluated the evidence for the role of sexual behaviours in the development of oropharyngeal cancers (OPCs) and oral cavity cancers (OCCs). Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we identified observational and interventional studies reporting associations between several different sexual behaviours and OPC or OCC. Study quality was assessed independently by two reviewers using a validated scoring system. Results: From 513 papers identified, 21, reporting on 20 studies, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two cohort studies were rated as moderate quality. The 18 case-control studies were rated as weak; nine comparing people with OPC or OCC to people without cancer, eight comparing HPV-positive to HPV-negative cancer patients and one comparing OPCs to other head and neck cancers. One study was a pooled analysis of seven of the included studies with some additional information. Twelve sexual behaviours were assessed and 69 associations reported. The studies differed in the comparisons made, the sexual behaviours assessed, and how these were reported and categorized, so no quantitative meta-analyses were appropriate. Most studies combined OPC and OCC. Several significantly increased risks were seen with a high number of lifetime sexual partners (nine studies) and with the practice of oral sex (five studies), although two studies found a significant negative association with OCC and ever performing oral sex. Two cohort studies of men and women in homosexual relationships found increases in oral cancer risk, and a cohort study of men married to women who had a history of cervical cancer also showed an increased risk of oral cancers. Results for other sexual behaviours were limited and inconsistent, and these included the following: younger age at first sexual intercourse, number of lifetime oral sex partners, the practice of oral-anal sex, the number of oral-anal sex partners, and ever performing anal sex. Only one study assessed casual sex, never or rare use of a condom and having a sexual partner with a history of genital warts, finding significant associations in the two former behaviours. Conclusion: The current evidence for sexual behaviours being risk factors for oral and oropharyngeal cancer is limited and inconsistent. Evidence suggests that the number of sexual partners and performing oral sex are associated with a greater risk. Furthermore men whose partners have had cervical cancer may have an increased risk. More studies looking at OPC specifically will be useful to determine whether these behaviours are subsite-selective."
4_h,health_belief,22429603,Does oral sex cause throat cancer?,oral sex causes throat cancer,1.0,"Introduction: Questions have recently arisen in the popular press about the association between specific sexual behaviors, namely, fellatio and cunnilingus, with head and neck cancers. Although there has been an overall decline in the incidence of head and neck cancers over the past 25 years, there has been a shift in the distribution of these cancers toward a particular type known as oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs), and a younger demographic. These particular cancers, OSCCs, have been shown to be associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Several researchers have suggested that this shift in the epidemiology of head and neck cancers might be attributable to changing sexual practices. While this speculation has caught on in the popular press, there are several interesting contradictions in the existing evidence that suggest this conclusion might be premature and overreached. Aim: The intent of this article is to help clarify the issues so that sexual medicine professionals can give accurate and up-to-date information to their patients. Main outcome measures: This is a review article; no outcome data are reported. This is a review article; no measures were collected. Methods: Pubmed search on HPV, oral sex, oral cancers, and OSCCs. Results: One hundred ninety-six articles on HPV were found; 63 articles on oral sex, 55 on oral cancer, and 5 articles on OSCCs were identified as relevant. Conclusions: HPV infections occur commonly and are usually cleared within 18 months, thus HPV infection should not be a cause for concern among monogamous couples with a rich and varied sex life as long as the sexual system remains closed and other immune compromising factors are not present. HPV becomes a concern in the context of immune system compromise and infection persistence. Factors contributing to immune system compromise, HPV persistence, and oncogenesis are reviewed."

Methods: We analyzed 2,441 oral cavity (925 women and 1,516 men), 2,297 oropharynx (564 women and 1,733 men), 508 hypopharynx (96 women and 412 men), and 1,740 larynx (237 women and 1,503 men) cases from the INHANCE consortium of 15 head and neck cancer case-control studies. Controls numbered from 7,604 to 13,829 subjects, depending on analysis. Analyses fitted linear-exponential excess ORs models. Results: ORs were increased in underweight ( 18.5 BMI) relative to normal weight (18.5-24.9) and reduced in overweight and obese categories (≥ 25 BMI) for all sites and were homogeneous by sex. ORs by smoking and drinking in women compared with men were significantly greater for oropharyngeal cancer (p 0.01 for both factors), suggestive for hypopharyngeal cancer (p = 0.05 and p = 0.06, respectively), but homogeneous for oral cavity (p = 0.56 and p = 0.64) and laryngeal (p = 0.18 and p = 0.72) cancers. Conclusions: The extent that OR modifications of smoking and drinking by sex for oropharyngeal and, possibly, hypopharyngeal cancers represent true associations, or derive from unmeasured confounders or unobserved sex-related disease subtypes (e.g., human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal cancer) remains to be clarified."

We studied 200 cases of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, of whom 57 women (median age = 64) and 200 hospital controls, frequency matched with cases by age and sex, in relation to smoking and drinking history, intake of 25 foods or food groups, indicators of oral hygiene and sexual activity, and history of sexually transmitted diseases. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained from unconditional multiple logistic regressions and adjusted for age, sex, area of residence, education, and smoking and drinking habits. In the multivariate model, high educational level and white-collar occupation, but not white race, were associated with halving of oral cancer risk. Smoking &gt; or =30 cigarettes per day showed an OR of 20.8 (95% CI: 8.9-48.3), similar to smoking &gt; or =4 cigars daily (OR = 20.5). Drinking &gt; or = 70 alcoholic drinks per week showed an OR of 5.7 (95% CI: 1.8-18.5). Hard liquors were by far the largest source of alcohol. Increased risk was associated with the highest tertile of intake for maize (OR = 1.9), meat (OR = 2.2) and ham and salami (OR = 2.0), whereas high fruit intake was associated with significantly decreased risk (OR = 0.4). Among indicators of dental care, number of missing teeth and poor general oral condition at oral inspection showed ORs of 2.7 and 2.6, respectively. Number of sexual partners, marriages or contacts with prostitutes, practice of oral sex and history of various sexually transmitted diseases, including genital warts, were not associated with oral cancer risk. 82% of oral cancer cases in Cuba were attributable to tobacco smoking, 19% to smoking cigars or pipe only. The fractions attributable to alcohol drinking (7%) and low fruit intake (11%) were more modest. Thus, decreases in cigarette and cigar smoking are at present the key to oral cancer prevention in Cuba."

Therefore, we compared the sexual behavior of patients with Barrett's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma and controls (hospital, reflux, and Barrett's metaplasia) to explore a plausible mechanism of viral transmission to the lower esophagus. A hospital-based case-control study involving 36 Barrett's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma subjects and 55 controls with known HPV DNA status and markers of transcriptional activity i.e p16INK4A and E6/E7 mRNA of the esophageal epithelium was conducted to evaluate differences in sexual history (if any). Barrett's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma patients were more likely than controls to be positive for HPV DNA (18 of 36, 50% vs. 6/55, 11%, p for trend 0.0001), be male (P = 0.001) and in a relationship (P = 0.02). Viral genotypes identified were HPV 16 (n = 14), 18 (n = 2), 11 (n = 1) and 6 (n = 1). HPV exposure conferred a significantly higher risk for Barrett's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma as compared with hospital/reflux/Barrett's metaplasia controls (OR = 6.8, 95% CI: 2.1-23.1, adjusted P = 0.002). On univariate analysis, ≥6 lifetime oral sex partners were significantly associated with dysplastic Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma (OR, 4.0; 95% CI: 1.2-13.7, P = 0.046). After adjustment for confounders, HPV exposure and men with ≥2 lifetime sexual partners were at significant risk for Barrett's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma. If these initial findings can be confirmed in larger studies, it could lead to effective prevention strategies in combating some of the exponential increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the West."

The purpose of the current study was to further investigate whether the annual UVR level, estimated on a county level, is associated with incidence rates of such cancers using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 data. If UVR exposure is associated with incidence of these cancer types, we would expect to see a similar or stronger association with melanoma because UVR exposure is a well-demonstrated risk factor for this disease. Thus, we also included melanoma in the study. Materials and methods: The study subjects were White and Black individuals with oral, pharyngeal, cervical cancer or melanoma diagnosed between 1973 and 2011 from the SEER 18 data. UVR was estimated at the county level and grouped into high-, medium- and low-exposure levels. Age-adjusted incidence rates of cancer were calculated and compared among the UVR exposure groups. The comparisons were also stratified by sex and race. Results: There was an inverse association between UVR exposure and incidence of oral, pharyngeal, and cervical cancer. The inverse association was also observed for melanoma. When stratified by race and sex, the inverse associations remained except for melanoma among Blacks. Conclusion: In contrast to a previous study, our study found that there were inverse associations between UVR exposure and the incidence of oral, pharyngeal, and cervical cancer, as well as of melanoma. Our findings are in agreement with several other published studies reporting no positive correlation between UVR exposure and the incidence rates of oral, pharyngeal, and cervical cancer and melanoma."

There is evidence that high dietary carotenoids and vitamin C may possibly decrease the risk of laryngeal cancer. Limited data is available from India on the association between these micronutrients and the risk of laryngeal cancer. Aims: To assess the levels of vitamin A, vitamin C and zinc in laryngeal cancer patients and healthy controls. Setting and design: A hospital based case- control study. Material and methods: One hundred and fifty five laryngeal cancer patients and a control group of 155 healthy individuals constituted the study population. Individuals in the control group were individually matched with the patients for their age +/- 2 years, sex and place of residence. Venous blood was drawn from the cases and controls and estimations of vitamin A, zinc and vitamin C was done utilizing the standard procedures. Statistical analysis used: Paired 't' test to compare the mean serum levels of vitamin A and zinc and plasma vitamin C between laryngeal cancer patients and controls. Univariate logistic regression analysis to calculate the odds ratios and the confidence intervals. Results: The mean serum vitamin A, zinc and plasma vitamin C levels were significantly lower in laryngeal cancer patients as compared to the controls. Conclusions: The findings of the present study indicated a strong association of these micronutrients with laryngeal cancer in the Indian population."
5_h,health_belief,25520574,Does smokeless tobacco cause cancer?,smokeless tobacco causes cancer,1.0,"Tobacco products which are used in a way other than smoking are known as smokeless tobacco. The most common smokeless tobaccos are chewing tobacco, naswar, snuff, snus, gutka, and topical tobacco paste. Any product which contains tobacco is not safe for human health. There are more than twenty-five compounds in smokeless tobacco which have cancer causing activity. Use of smokeless tobacco has been linked with risk of oral cancer. Smokeless tobacco contains tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), polonium, formaldehyde, cadmium, lead, and benzo[a]pyrene, which are carcinogenic agents. Although there is presence of some compounds, carotenoids and phenolic compounds, that have cancer inhibiting properties, they are in low concentrations. Dry snuff use is linked with higher relative risks, while the use of other smokeless tobacco is of intermediate risk. Moist snuff and chewing tobacco have a very low risk for oral cancer. Therefore, from this review article, it was concluded that smokeless tobacco has risk for oral cancer - either low, medium or high depending on the balance between cancer causing agents and cancer inhibiting agents."

Although epidemiological data from the USA and Asia show a raised risk of oral cancer (overall relative risk 2.6 [95% CI 1.3-5.2]), these are not confirmed in northern European studies (1.0 [0.7-1.3]). Risks of oesophageal cancer (1.6 [1.1-2.3]) and pancreatic cancer (1.6 [1.1-2.2]) have also increased, as shown in northern European studies. Results on lung cancer have been inconsistent, with northern European studies suggesting no excess risk. In India and Sudan, more than 50% of oral cancers are attributable to smokeless tobacco products used in those countries, as are about 4% of oral cancers in US men and 20% of oesophageal and pancreatic cancers in Swedish men. Smokeless tobacco products are a major source of carcinogenic nitrosamines; biomarkers of exposure have been developed to quantify exposure as a framework for a carcinogenesis model in people. Animal carcinogenicity studies strongly support clinical results. Cancer risk of smokeless tobacco users is probably lower than that of smokers, but higher than that of non-tobacco users."
5_h,health_belief,17583577,Does smokeless tobacco cause cancer?,smokeless tobacco causes cancer,1.0,"Hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers are among the most common cancers in India. In addition to smoking, tobacco chewing may be a major risk factor for some of these cancers in India. Using data from a multicentric case-control study conducted in India that included 513 hypopharyngeal cancer cases, 511 laryngeal cancer cases and 718 controls, we investigated smoking and chewing tobacco products as risk factors for these cancers. Bidi smoking was a stronger risk factor compared to cigarette smoking for cancer of the hypopharynx (OR(bidi) 6.80 vs. OR(cig) 3.82) and supraglottis (OR(bidi) 7.53 vs. OR(cig) 2.14), while the effect of the 2 products was similar for cancer of the glottis (OR(bidi) 5.32 vs. OR(cig) 5.74). Among never-smokers, tobacco chewing was a risk factor for hypopharyngeal cancer, but not for laryngeal cancer. In particular, the risk of hypopharyngeal cancer increased with the use of Khaini (OR 2.02, CI 0.81-5.05), Mawa (OR 3.17, CI 1.06-9.53), Pan (OR 3.34, CI 1.68-6.61), Zarda (OR 3.58, CI 1.20-10.68) and Gutkha (OR 4.59, CI 1.21-17.49). A strong dose-response relationship was observed between chewing frequency and the risk of hypopharyngeal cancer (p(trend) 0.001). An effect of alcohol on cancer of the hypopharynx and supraglottis was observed only among daily drinkers (OR 2.22, CI 1.11-4.45 and OR 3.76, CI 1.25-11.30, respectively). In summary, this study shows that chewing tobacco products commercially available in India are risk factors for hypopharyngeal cancer, and that the potency of Bidi smoking may be higher than that of cigarette smoking for hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers."

A plethora of smokeless tobacco products lead to unacceptable exposure to multiple carcinogens, including the tobacco-specific nitrosamine N'-nitrosonornicotine, a likely cause of the commonly occurring oral cavity cancers observed particularly in South-East Asian countries. Cigarettes continue to deliver a large number of carcinogens, including tobacco-specific nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds. The multiple carcinogens in cigarette smoke are responsible for the complex mutations observed in critical cancer genes. The exposure of smokeless tobacco users and smokers to carcinogens and toxicants can now be monitored by urinary and DNA adduct biomarkers that may be able to identify those individuals at highest risk of cancer so that effective cancer prevention interventions can be initiated. Regulation of the levels of carcinogens, toxicants and nicotine in tobacco products and evidence-based tobacco control efforts are now recognized as established pathways to preventing tobacco related cancer."

While cigarette smoking may be associated with breast cancer, smokeless tobacco use has never been evaluated as a breast cancer risk factor. This study explores such an association. Methods: A complete census was carried out among Eastern Band Cherokee women aged 18 years and older, residing on tribal lands in western North Carolina. Self-reported alcohol, cigarette and smokeless tobacco use, demographic information, and personal history of breast cancer (stratified by age of onset 55 years or &gt; or = 55 years) were obtained by questionnaire. Results: 1,070 out of 1,408 (76%) eligible women were interviewed. Current and former smokeless tobacco use was common (6% and 21%, respectively). Five cases of breast cancer were identified in women under the age of 55 years and 3 cases were found in women at &gt; or = 55 years. Only the odds ratio (OR) for younger-onset breast cancer among ever-users of smokeless tobacco was significantly elevated (OR = 7.79, 95% CI = 1.05-66.0). While the ORs for younger onset breast cancer were elevated among ever-smokers or women reporting at least monthly alcohol use, these were not significant (OR 8.49, 95% CI = 0.09-200; and OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 0.19-15.2, respectively). No ORs were significantly elevated for breast cancer among older women. Conclusions: These preliminary data are the first to document an apparent relationship between smokeless tobacco use and breast cancer risk, but should be confirmed in other studies due to the small number of cases. The nearly 8-fold increase in risk suggests that smokeless tobacco is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking."

Collectively, these brochures state that ST use causes oral leukoplakia, other oral conditions, and cancers of the oral cavity, larynx, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, prostate, bladder, and kidney. We then reviewed the scientific literature to determine whether these claims were substantiated. Results: Only for oral leukoplakia and several oral conditions is the evidence persuasive for causation by ST. The evidence that ST causes oral cancer is very suggestive, whereas the evidence for causation of other cancers is either absent or contradictory. Conclusions: Communication of the health risks of using ST must be done accurately and should be data based. Broadening the message to include additional diseases for which the evidence is inadequate could cause the message about true risks, as well as the messenger, to be discounted."

Although information for the US is sparse, extensive epidemiologic data are available from India, where the use of tobacco is prevalent and the incidence of oral cancer very high. The Indian data suggest that oral cancer and precancerous lesions occur almost solely among those with tobacco habits, the rate of malignant transformation of precancerous lesions is not greater than in the West, the relative risk of developing oral cancer is similar in India and in the US, and this risk rises with duration of use. Thus, it seems likely that increased usage of smokeless tobacco in the US will eventually lead to an increased incidence of precancerous and cancerous oral lesions in Americans."

The microbial community ferment compounds present in the smokeless tobacco products and convert them into carcinogens like tobacco-associated nitrosamines. However, the potential of smokeless tobacco products associated bacteriome to manipulate systemic inflammation and other signaling pathways involved in the etiology of oral cancer will be a risk factor for oral cancer. Further, damage to oral epithelial cells causes a leaky oral layer that leads to increased infiltration of bacterial components like lipopolysaccharide, flagellin, and toxins, etc. The consumption of smokeless tobacco products can cause damage to the oral layer and dysbiosis of oral microbiota. Hence, the enrichment of harmful microbes due to dysbiosis in the oral cavity can produce high levels of bacterial metabolites and provoke inflammation as well as carcinogenesis. Understanding the complex and dynamic interrelation between the smokeless tobacco-linked bacteriome and host oral microbiome may help to unravel the mechanism of oral carcinogenesis stimulated by smokeless tobacco products. This review provides an insight into smokeless tobacco product-associated bacteriome and their potential in the progression of oral cancer. In the future, this will guide in the evolution of prevention and treatment strategies against smokeless tobacco products-induced oral cancer. Besides, it will assist the government organizations for better management and cessation policy building for the worldwide problem of smokeless tobacco addiction."

ST products contain a large array of carcinogens, although the number found is actually smaller than in cigarette smoke. Worldwide, ST products have many different names depending on the region where it is produced. However, there are two main types of ST, chewing tobacco and snuff.

Methods: Using data from a prospective cohort of the US population, we categorized 6,779 subjects 45-75 years of age as ST users or non-ST users. Subjects were further stratified by cigarette smoking status in order to differentiate 'exclusive' ST users (n=414) from never tobacco users (n=2,979). Results: In this cohort, exclusive ST use was not associated with increased incidence of all cancer in males (hazard ratio=0.8, 95% CI: 0.4, 1.6) or females (HR=1.2, 95% CI: 0.7-2.1) or oral cancer (standardized incidence ratio=30, 95% CI: 3, 95). No synergistic effect was observed between ST and cigarette smoking among male combined users (females were not analyzed for combined use) for the major cancers. Conclusions: In contrast to the well-known deleterious effects of cigarette smoking, ST use did not substantially increase the risk for cancer incidence above that of non-tobacco users, particularly among males. Although the use of tobacco in any form is to be discouraged, our data suggests that cancer risks are much lower from ST use than from cigarette smoking."

Big social media data has potential to provide deeper insights about these associations to public health analysts. In this interdisciplinary study, we demonstrate the value of incorporating domain-specific knowledge in the learning process to identify the relationships between cannabis use and depression. We develop an end-to-end knowledge infused deep learning framework (Gated-K-BERT) that leverages the pre-trained BERT language representation model and domain-specific declarative knowledge source (Drug Abuse Ontology) to jointly extract entities and their relationship using gated fusion sharing mechanism. Our model is further tailored to provide more focus to the entities mention in the sentence through entity-position aware attention layer, where ontology is used to locate the target entities position. Experimental results show that inclusion of the knowledge-aware attentive representation in association with BERT can extract the cannabis-depression relationship with better coverage in comparison to the state-of-the-art relation extractor."

Method: A review of the literature suggesting potential depressogenic effects of long-term treatment with antidepressant drugs was performed. A MEDLINE search was conducted using the keywords tolerance, sensitization, antidepressive agents, and switching. This was supplemented by a manual search of Index Medicus under the heading ""antidepressant agents"" and a manual search of the literature for articles pointing to paradoxical effects of antidepressants. Results: A number of reported clinical findings point to the following possibilities: very unfavorable long-term outcome of major depression treated by pharmacologic means, paradoxical (depression-inducing) effects of antidepressant drugs in some patients with mood and anxiety disturbances, antidepressant-induced switching and cycle acceleration in bipolar disorder, occurrence of tolerance to the effects of antidepressants during long-term treatment, onset of resistance upon rechallenge with the same antidepressant drug in a few patients, and withdrawal syndromes following discontinuation of mood-elevating drugs. These phenomena in susceptible individuals may be explained on the basis of the oppositional model of tolerance. Continued drug treatment may recruit processes that oppose the initial acute effects of a drug and may result in loss of clinical effect. When drug treatment ends, these processes may operate unopposed, at least for some time, and increase vulnerability to relapse. Conclusion: The possibility that antidepressant drugs may worsen the course of depression needs to be tested, even though its scientific exploration is likely to encounter considerable methodological and ideological difficulties. The clinical implications of this hypothesis in depression are considerable. Antidepressant drugs are crucial in the treatment of major depressive episodes. However, appraisal of paradoxical effects that may occur in susceptible patients during long-term treatment may lead to more effective use of the drugs."

The purpose of this study is to examine whether TrkB ligands show antidepressant effects in an inflammation-induced model of depression. Methods: In this study, we examined the effects of TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) and TrkB antagonist ANA-12 on depression-like behavior and morphological changes in mice previously exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Protein levels of BDNF, phospho-TrkB (p-TrkB), and TrkB in the brain regions were also examined. Results: LPS caused a reduction of BDNF in the CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas LPS increased BDNF in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Dexamethason suppression tests showed hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in LPS-treated mice. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 7,8-DHF showed antidepressant effects on LPS-induced depression-like behavior, and i.p. pretreatment with ANA-12 blocked its antidepressant effects. Surprisingly, ANA-12 alone showed antidepressant-like effects on LPS-induced depression-like behavior. Furthermore, bilateral infusion of ANA-12 into the NAc showed antidepressant effects. Moreover, LPS caused a reduction of spine density in the CA3, DG, and PFC, whereas LPS increased spine density in the NAc. Interestingly, 7,8-DHF significantly attenuated LPS-induced reduction of p-TrkB and spine densities in the CA3, DG, and PFC, whereas ANA-12 significantly attenuated LPS-induced increases of p-TrkB and spine density in the NAc. Conclusions: The results suggest that LPS-induced inflammation may cause depression-like behavior by altering BDNF and spine density in the CA3, DG, PFC, and NAc, which may be involved in the antidepressant effects of 7,8-DHF and ANA-12, respectively."

Method: An online survey on causal beliefs about depression and experiences with antidepressants was completed by 1829 New Zealand adults prescribed anti-depressants in the preceding five years, 97.4% of whom proceeded to take antidepressants. Results: The most frequently endorsed of 17 causal beliefs were family stress, relationship problems, loss of loved one, financial problems, isolation, and abuse or neglect in childhood. Factor analysis produced three factors: 'bio-genetic', 'adulthood stress' and 'childhood adversity'. The most strongly endorsed explanations for increases in antidepressant prescribing invoked improved identification, reduced stigma and drug company marketing. The least strongly endorsed was 'Anti-depressants are the best treatment'. Regression analyses revealed that self-reported efficacy of the antidepressants was positively associated with bio-genetic causal beliefs, negatively associated with childhood adversity beliefs and unrelated to adulthood stress beliefs. The belief that 'People cannot׳ get better by themselves even if they try' was positively associated with bio-genetic beliefs. Limitations: The convenience sample may have been biased towards a favourable view of bio-genetic explanations, since 83% reported that the medication reduced their depression. Conclusions: Clinicians׳ should consider exploring patients׳ causal beliefs. The public, even when taking antidepressants, continues to hold a multi-factorial causal model of depression with a primary emphasis on psycho-social causes. A three factor model of those beliefs may lead to more sophisticated understandings of relationships with stigma variables."
6_h,health_belief,28558366,Does antidepressant cause depression?,antidepressant causes depression,1.0,"Background: The issue of antidepressant-induced mood switches to hypomania, mania, or mixed states within the course of mayor depressive disorder (MDD) has been a controversial topic. The present post-hoc analysis of the BRIDGE-II-MIX study focuses on the clinical features of patients with history of antidepressant-induced hypomania/mania (AIHM) in a large international sample of patients with major depressive episode (MDE). Methods: 2811 subjects with major depression were enrolled in this multicentre cross-sectional study. Current mixed symptoms, socio-demographic and other clinical variables were collected and compared among MDD-AIHM, MDD and BD patients. Results: 475 patients out of 2811 had history of AIHM (16.90%). In the MDD-AIHM group, familiarity for BD and rates of atypical features and comorbid anxiety, eating and borderline personality disorders were similar to BD and significantly more frequent compared to MDD group. MDD-AIHM patients had more frequently more than 3 episodes and reported higher rates of treatment resistance, mood lability and irritability following treatment with antidepressants. Frequencies of depression with mixed features and (hypo)manic symptoms were similar in patients of MDD-AIHM and BD groups and significantly higher in both groups than in MDD. Limitations: there were widely varying rates of hospitalized patients across countries and the participating centres were not randomly selected. Conclusions: Our results strongly support the DSM-5 inclusion of MDD patients with AIHM within the rubric of bipolar disorder. Differences with other MDD and BD were also observed suggesting the possibility that MDD-AIHM may represent a specific sub-population, particularly sensitive to exogenous input from antidepressants."
6_h,health_belief,23219059,Does antidepressant cause depression?,antidepressant causes depression,1.0,"Objectives: Compare reported rates of mood-shifts from major depression to mania/hypomania/mixed-states during antidepressant (AD)-treatment and rates of diagnostic change from major depressive disorder (MDD) to bipolar disorder (BPD). Methods: Searching computerized literature databases, followed by summary analyses. Results: In 51 reports of patients diagnosed with MDD and treated with an AD, the overall risk of mood-switching was 8.18% (7837/95,786) within 2.39 ± 2.99 years of treatment, or 3.42 (95% CI: 3.34-3.50) %/year. Risk was 2.6 (CI: 2.5-2.8) times greater with/without AD-treatment by meta-analysis of 10 controlled trials. Risk increased with time up to 24 months of treatment, with no secular change (1968-2012). Incidence rates were 4.5 (CI: 4.1-4.8)-times greater among juveniles than adults (5.62/1.26 %/year; p 0.0001). In 12 studies the overall rate of new BPD-diagnoses was 3.29% (1928/56,754) within 5.38 years (0.61 [0.58-0.64] %/year), or 5.6-times lower (3.42/0.61) than annualized rates of mood-switching. Conclusions: AD-treatment was associated with new mania-like responses in 8.18% of patients diagnosed with unipolar MDD. Contributions to mood-switching due to unrecognized BPD versus mood-elevating pharmacological effects, as well as quantitative associations between switching and later diagnosis of BPD not associated with AD-treatment remain uncertain. Limitations: Rates and definitions of mood-switching with ADs varied greatly, exposure-times rarely were precisely defined, and there was little information on predictive associations between mood-switches and BPD-diagnosis."

Method: An online survey on a range of beliefs about depression, and experiences with antidepressants, was completed by 1829 New Zealand adults prescribed anti-depressants in the preceding five years, 97.4% of whom proceeded to take antidepressants. Results: Six of 17 beliefs about the causes of their own depression were endorsed by more than half the sample: chemical imbalance, family stress, work stress, heredity, relationship problems and distressing events in childhood. There were some marked differences in content, structure and level of conviction of beliefs about one׳s own depression and the sample׳s previously published beliefs about depression in general. There were also significant differences between the beliefs of demographic groupings. Regression analyses revealed that self-reported effectiveness of the antidepressants was positively associated with bio-genetic causal beliefs. The quality of the relationship with the prescribing doctor was positively related to a belief in chemical imbalance as a cause and negatively related to a belief in unemployment as a cause. Limitations: The convenience sample may have been biased towards a favourable view of bio-genetic explanations, since 83% reported that the medication reduced their depression. Conclusions: People experiencing depression hold complex, multifactorial and idiosyncratic sets of beliefs about the causes of their own depression, apparently based at least in part on their own life experiences and circumstances. Exploring those beliefs may enhance the doctor-patient relationship and selection of appropriate treatment modality."
6_h,health_belief,22778410,Does antidepressant cause depression?,antidepressant causes depression,1.0,"Depression is a debilitating mental illness and is often comorbid with metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone with antidiabetic and insulin-sensitizing properties. Here we show that adiponectin levels in plasma are reduced in a chronic social-defeat stress model of depression, which correlates with decreased social interaction time. A reduction in adiponectin levels caused by haploinsufficiency results in increased susceptibility to social aversion, ""anhedonia,"" and learned helplessness and causes impaired glucocorticoid-mediated negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of an adiponectin neutralizing antibody precipitates stress-induced depressive-like behavior. Conversely, i.c.v. administration of exogenous adiponectin produces antidepressant-like behavioral effects in normal-weight mice and in diet-induced obese diabetic mice. Taken together, these results suggest a critical role of adiponectin in depressive-like behaviors and point to a potential innovative therapeutic approach for depressive disorders."

Although antidepressants are effective in reducing depression, their use in patients with cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Objective: To undertake a secondary analysis to determine the effects of using antidepressants on morbidity and mortality in post-MI patients who participated in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease study. Design: Observational secondary analysis. Setting: Eight academic sites. Patients: The Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease clinical trial randomized 2481 depressed and/or socially isolated patients from October 1, 1996, to October 31, 1999. Depression was diagnosed using a structured clinical interview. This analysis was conducted on the 1834 patients enrolled with depression (849 women and 985 men). Intervention: Use of antidepressant medication. Main outcome measures: Event-free survival was defined as the absence of death or recurrent MI. All-cause mortality was also examined. To relate exposure to antidepressants to subsequent morbidity and mortality, the data were analyzed using a time-dependent covariate model. Results: During a mean follow-up of 29 months, 457 fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events occurred. The risk of death or recurrent MI was significantly lower in patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.84), as were the risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37-0.96) and recurrent MI (adjusted HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.90), compared with patients who did not use selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. For patients taking non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, the comparable HRs (95% CIs) were 0.72 (0.44-1.18), 0.64 (0.34-1.22), and 0.73 (0.38-1.38) for risk of death or recurrent MI, all-cause mortality, or recurrent MI, respectively, compared with nonusers. Conclusions: Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depressed patients who experience an acute MI might reduce subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A controlled trial is needed to examine this important issue."
6_h,health_belief,14996139,Does antidepressant cause depression?,antidepressant causes depression,1.0,Objectives: To determine if the classification of 'antidepressant-induced hypomania' in DSM-IV is supported by available data. Methods: We reviewed the available scientific literature to examine the incidence of mania and hypomania in non-bipolar patients who were treated with antidepressants. Results: Eighty-nine per cent of studies of antidepressants in major depressive disorder patients reported no cases of treatment-induced hypomania. No instances of treatment-induced hypomania were reported in three large studies of patients with chronic forms of depression. Conclusions: The rate of antidepressant-induced hypomania in major depressive disorder is within the rate of misdiagnosis of bipolar depression as unipolar. Depressed patients who experience antidepressant-associated hypomania are truly bipolar.

The occupational health service (OHS) can offer work-directed interventions to support employers and employees. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on sickness absence and health of a work-directed intervention given by the OHS to employees with CMDs or stress-related symptoms. Methods: Randomisation was conducted at the OHS consultant level and each consultant was allocated into either giving a brief problem-solving intervention (PSI) or care as usual (CAU). The study group consisted of 100 employees with stress symptoms or CMDs. PSI was highly structured and used a participatory approach, involving both the employee and the employee's manager. CAU was also work-directed but not based on the same theoretical concepts as PSI. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, at 6 and at 12 months. Primary outcome was registered sickness absence during the 1-year follow-up period. Among the secondary outcomes were self-registered sickness absence, return to work (RTW) and mental health. Results: A statistical interaction for group × time was found on the primary outcome (p=0.033) and PSI had almost 15 days less sickness absence during follow-up compared with CAU. Concerning the secondary outcomes, PSI showed an earlier partial RTW and the mental health improved in both groups without significant group differences. Conclusion: PSI was effective in reducing sickness absence which was the primary outcome in this study."

The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of all-cause and diagnosis-specific disability pension in sickness absentees with stress-related mental disorders. Methods: A cohort of 36304 non-retired individuals aged 16-64 years at 31.12.2004 with at-least one sickness absence spell due to stress-related mental disorders (SRMD) initiated in 2005 in Sweden was followed-up with regard to disability pension (2006-2010) by linkage of registers. Uni- and multivariate Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% Confidence Intervals, CI, were estimated using Cox regression for several risk markers. Results: During the follow-up period, 2735 individuals (7.5%) were granted a disability pension, predominantly due to mental diagnoses (n = 2004, 73.3%). In the multivariate analyses, female sex, age exceeding 35 years, low educational level, being born in a country outside EU25 and Northern Europe, residing outside big cities, living alone, having had a long duration of the first spell due to SRMD (&gt;90 days); mental disorders necessitating frequent specialised health care as well as comorbid somatic disorders were found to be predictive of granting disability pension. Some different patterns emerged for risk factors related to diagnosis-specific disability pension and for younger and older individuals. Conclusions: Several predictors could be identified as risk markers for disability pension. The variation in the effect of risk markers with regard to age and diagnosis of disability pension speaks in favour of the importance of a person-centered approach in treatment and rehabilitation."

Oxidation is often a by-product of processes involved in the acute phase response, which may result in antimicrobial or self-damaging effects. We measured the immunological and oxidative status responses of Egyptian fruit bats ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ) to a simulated bacterial infection using lipopolysaccharide injection. As expected, experimental bats exhibited increases in two humoral immunological markers. However, they surprisingly did not show any effects across two markers of oxidative damage and four antioxidant markers. We propose that this lack of effects on oxidative status may be due to a reduction in cell metabolism through sickness behaviours or given life history traits, such as a long lifespan and a frugivorous diet. Finally, the consistency in the pattern of elevation in haptoglobin and lysozyme between current and previous findings highlights their utility as diagnostic markers for extracellular infections in bats."

They result in suffering for the individual and considerable financial costs for the employer and for society at large. The occupational health service (OHS) can offer interventions in which both the individual and the work situation are taken into account. The aim of this paper is to describe the design of a study evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention given at the OHS to employees with CMDs or stress-related symptoms at work. In addition, intervention fidelity and its relation to the outcome will be assessed in a process analysis. Methods: The study is designed as a cluster randomized trial in which the participating OHS consultants are randomized into either delivering the intervention or performing care as usual. Employees with CMDs or stress-related symptoms at work are recruited consecutively by the OHS consultants. The intervention aims to improve the match between the employee and the job situation. Interviews are held individually with the employee and the nearest supervisor, after which a joint meeting with both the employee and the supervisor takes place. A participatory approach is applied by which the supervisor and the employee are guided by the OHS consultant and encouraged to actively take part in problem solving concerning the work situation. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at six and 12 months. A long-term follow-up at 3 years will also be performed. The primary outcome is registered sickness absence during a 1-year period after study inclusion. Secondary outcomes are mental health and work ability. The intervention's cost effectiveness, compared to treatment as usual, both for society and for the employer will be evaluated. A process evaluation by both the OHS consultants and the employee will be carried out. Discussion: The study includes analyses of the effectiveness of the intervention (clinical and economic) as well as an analysis of its implementation at the participating OHSs. Possible methodological challenges such as selection bias and risk of contamination between OHS consultants delivering the experimental condition and consultants giving usual care are discussed.

The physical and emotional stress caused by pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting may influence maternal psychosocial adaptation yet few studies have examined these relationships. Objectives: The purpose of the study was to examine the relationships between nausea and vomiting, perceived stress, social support and their ability to predict maternal psychosocial adaptation among Taiwanese women during early pregnancy. Design: A correlational, cross-sectional research design. Setting: Four prenatal clinics in Taiwan. Participants: Women (n=243) who had completed the 6-16 week of gestation consented to participate. Methods: Subjects completed four self-report questionnaires in additional to providing demographic data: Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching (INVR), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL), and the Prenatal Self-Evaluation Questionnaire (PSEQ). Results: Pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting was experienced in varying degrees by 188 (77.4%) women. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that 37.6% of the variance in maternal psychosocial adaptation was explained by the severity of nausea and vomiting, perceived stress, social support, and pregnancy planning. Conclusions: Women at higher risk for poor maternal psychosocial adaptation have not planned their pregnancy and experience severe pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting. Severe pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting associated with high-perceived stress levels may be mediated by social support."

Despite the size of this health problem, research on risk factors for severe medical outcomes, like suicidal behavior, is lacking to date. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of suicide attempt and suicide among sickness absentees with SRMD. Methods: A cohort of 36,304 non-retired individuals, aged 16-64 years on 31.12.2004, with at least one sickness absence spell due to SRMD, initiated in 2005, was followed up with regard to suicide attempt (2006-2009) and suicide (2006-2008). Univariate and multivariate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for a number of predictors. Results: During the follow-up period, 266 individuals attempted suicide and 34 committed suicide. In the multivariate analyses, the following factors increased the risk of suicide attempt: = 25 years of age, low educational level, lone parenthood, &gt; 1 sickness absence spell, long duration of the first spell of sickness absence due to SRMD (&gt; 180 days), &gt; 4 and &gt; 8 days of inpatient care due to somatic or mental diagnoses (2000-2005), and &gt; 4 and &gt; 1 outpatient visits due to somatic or mental diagnoses (2001-2005), respectively. Hazard ratios ranged from 1.4 to 4.2. Health care due to mental diagnoses and &gt; 1 spell of sickness absence regardless of diagnosis were predictive of suicide. Conclusions: Several predictors related to socio-demographics, sickness absence and health-care consumption were identified as risk factors for suicidal behavior. Consideration of these risk factors is of both clinical and public health importance."

Modification of symptomatic responses by stress may play a role in medically unexplained symptoms attributed to low-level chemical exposures. Objectives: We hypothesized that the combination of exposure to diesel exhaust (DE) and acute psychological stress would cause sickness responses in healthy volunteers. Moreover, these responses would be greater in individuals with self-reported prior chemical odor intolerance. Methods: One hundred adult subjects underwent 1-hr exposures to diluted DE and clean air control. Half of the subjects performed a public-speaking stressor task during the exposures. Subjects completed questionnaires to determine their Chemical Odor Intolerance Index score. Plasma cortisol, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and the severity of 35 symptoms were measured at time points before and after the exposures. Results: Subjects exposed to DE demonstrated small but statistically significant increases in severity for several symptom categories, including sickness response and upper respiratory, central nervous system, and total symptoms. The psychological stressor did not increase symptom severity independently or via interaction with DE. Subjects with prior self-reported chemical intolerance had more severe sickness response symptoms from DE. Conclusions: These results suggest that exposure to DE can cause acute sickness response symptoms and that these symptoms are also associated with increased levels of self-reported chemical intolerance. The results did not confirm our hypothesis that an acute stressor would increase sickness response symptom severity during the exposure."

Each participant, in addition to a sickness absence questionnaire, was given a job stress questionnaire, to determine the effect of stress factors on absenteeism. A further job involvement questionnaire was used to assess prevailing attitudes to work. It was found that sickness caused by zoonotic illness accounted for only 6.8% of all absences. The majority of sickness absences were caused by nonzoonotic viral infections 39.3%, surgical operations 17.1%; and stress related disease 15.4%.

Aims: To develop a clinically implementable prediction model for the duration of SA due to stress-related disorders. Methods: All new SA spells with F43 diagnosis code lasting &gt;14 days and initiated between 2010-01-01 and 2012-06-30 were identified through data from the Social Insurance Agency. Information on baseline predictors was linked on individual level from other nationwide registers. Piecewise-constant hazard regression was used to predict the duration of the SA. Split-sample validation was used to develop and validate the model, and c-statistics and calibration plots to evaluate it. Results: Overall 83,443 SA spells, belonging to 77,173 individuals were identified. The median SA duration was 55 days (10% were &gt;365 days). Age, sex, geographical region, employment status, educational level, extent of SA at start and SA days, outpatient healthcare visits, and multi-morbidity in the preceding 365 days were selected to the final model.

Limitations: The heterogeneity of the F43-diagnosis and the exclusive use of register-based predictors limited our possibility to increase the discriminatory accuracy of the prediction. Conclusion: The final model could be implementable in clinical settings to predict duration of SA due to stress-related disorders and could satisfyingly discriminate long-term SA."

Most of the mood stabilizer and antidepressant drugs can lead to this condition. Some antipsychotic and antianxiety agents induce alopecia. Hair loss is also related to hypothyroidism, which can be induced by lithium and other agents. Alopecia might not be reported by some people, but physicians should be aware of this potential problem which may contribute to noncompliance. Lithium causes hair loss in 12-19% of long-term users. Valproic acid and/ or divalproex precipitates alopecia in up to 12% of patients in a dose-dependent relationship. Incidences up to 28% are observed with high valproate concentration exposures. These pharmaceuticals also can change hair color and structure. The occurrence of carbamazepine-induced alopecia is at or below 6%. Hair loss is less common with other mood stabilizers. Tricyclic antidepressants, maprotilene, trazodone, and virtually all the new generation of antidepressants may on rare occasions lead to alopecia. The same applies to haloperidol, olanzepine, risperidone, clonazepam, and buspirone, but not to other neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates, selected antihistamines, and antiparkinsonians. Discontinuation of the medication or dose reduction almost always leads to complete hair regrowth. The therapeutic value of mineral supplements remains unclear."
8_h,health_belief,8018303,Does medication cause hair loss?,medication causes hair loss,1.0,"A large number of drugs may interfere with the hair cycle and produce hair loss. Drugs may affect anagen follicles through 2 main different modalities: (i) by inducing an abrupt cessation of mitotic activity in rapidly dividing hair matrix cells (anagen effluvium) or (ii) by precipitating the follicles into premature rest (telogen effluvium). In anagen effluvium, hair loss usually occurs within days to weeks of drug administration, whereas in telogen effluvium, hair loss becomes evident 2 to 4 months after starting treatment. Anagen effluvium is a prominent adverse effect of antineoplastic agents, which cause acute damage of rapidly dividing hair matrix cells. Telogen effluvium may be a consequence of a large number of drugs including anticoagulants, retinol (vitamin A) and its derivatives, interferons and antihyperlipidaemic drugs. Drug-induced hair loss is usually reversible after interruption of treatment. The prevalence and severity of alopecia depend on the drug as well as on individual predisposition. Some drugs produce hair loss in most patients receiving appropriate dosages while other drugs are only occasionally responsible for hair abnormalities. Both hirsutism and hypertrichosis may be associated with drug administration. Drugs most commonly responsible for the development of hirsutism include testosterone, danazol, corticotrophin (ACTH), metyrapone, anabolic steroids and glucocorticoids.

Patients and methods: This is an observational cross-sectional study that had been conducted during the period from September 2020 to March 2021 years. Thirty-nine patients with post COVID-19 hair loss are confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody testing. Hair pull test was carried out to confirm the diagnosis and severity of telogen effluvium. Results: Thirty-nine patients were evaluated; their ages ranged from 22 to 67 years with a mean and SD of 41.3 ± 11.6 years with 36 (92.3%) females and 3 (7.69%) males. All patients with a diagnosis of ATE were enrolled in this study and had a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection; 15 (38.46%) patients reported mild symptoms, 24 (61.53%) patients presented with moderate disease, and no patient required hospitalization. They all experienced excessive hair loss within 2-3 months after infection. Pull tests were strongly positive (&gt; 10-50% with a mean of 35% of pulled hair away from scalp). Conclusion: COVID-19 infection is now a frequent and a common cause of acute telogen effluvium. Hence, clinicians should be aware about the relation between this infection and this pattern of hair loss.

Drug-induced alopecia is usually described as a diffuse non-scarring alopecia which is reversible upon withdrawal of the drug. Only a few drugs (mainly antimitotic agents) routinely cause hair loss whereas many drugs may be the cause of isolated cases of alopecia. Some psychotropic drugs are likely to induce a drug-related alopecia. Case reports with tricyclic antidepressants rarely appear in the literature. It has been reported that 15 per cent of patients taking lithium developed hair thinning. Hair loss is reported secondary to some anticonvulsant agents mainly valproic acid. Among antihypertensive drugs, systemic or topic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists should be considered as possible causes of hair loss. Hair loss from salicylates or nonsteroidal analgesics occurs in a very small percentage of patients. All anticoagulant and antithyroid drugs can produce hair loss. Diffuse hair loss can also be associated with the use of oral contraceptives, while receiving the pill and after stopping the drug. There is a long list of drugs that on occasion have been cited as causing hair loss: cimetidine, retinoids, amphetamines, bromocriptine and levodopa. A few isolated cases have been reported with some hypocholesterolaemic or anti-infectious agents. Diagnosis of drug-induced alopecia remains difficult. The only way to confirm it is to see if an improvement occurs after cessation of the suspected drug.

Patients may present to their family physician first with diffuse or patchy hair loss. Scarring alopecia is best evaluated by a dermatologist. Nonscarring alopecias can be readily diagnosed and treated in the family physician's office. Androgenetic alopecia can be diagnosed clinically and treated with minoxidil. Alopecia areata is diagnosed by typical patches of hair loss and is self-limited. Tinea capitis causes patches of alopecia that may be erythematous and scaly and must be treated systemically. Telogen effluvium is a nonscarring, noninflammatory alopecia of relatively sudden onset caused by physiologic or emotional stress. Once the precipitating cause is removed, the hair typically will regrow. Trichotillomania is an impulse-control disorder; treatment is aimed at controlling the underlying psychiatric condition. Trichorrhexis nodosa occurs when hairs break secondary to trauma and is often a result of hair styling or overuse of hair products. Anagen effluvium is the abnormal diffuse loss of hair during the growth phase caused by an event that impairs the mitotic activity of the hair follicle, most commonly chemotherapy. Physician support is especially important for patients in this situation."

Data sources: A literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), and the Cochrane database (through May 2014). Relevant conference abstracts and product monographs were reviewed. Search terms included antiretroviral, individual antiretroviral classes and names, highly active antiretroviral therapy, HIV, AIDS, alopecia, hair, hair loss and drug. Study selection and data extraction: English-language studies and case reports were included. A total of 16 articles and 1 conference abstract were retrieved, with a total of 46 patients with hair loss. Data synthesis: The protease inhibitor class, in particular indinavir, was most commonly reported to cause hair loss, followed by the NRTI, lamivudine. The majority of cases presented with alopecia of the scalp alone, with a median time of onset of 2.5 months. Management involved discontinuing the drug in most cases, with at least partial reversal in half the cases. Conclusions: In antiretroviral-induced alopecia, discontinuation of the suspected agent is the optimal management, and hair regrowth should occur within 1 to 3 months. Management may also include replacing the offending medication with an antiretroviral less likely to cause hair loss. It is essential to rule out other causes of alopecia with a complete patient history, including characterization of the hair loss and assessment of the patient's medical history, medication use, and family history of alopecia."

The objective of the study was to compare the CSE profiles in a large specialty practice-based sample of patients taking both older and newer AEDs. Methods: As part of the Columbia and Yale AED Database Project, we reviewed patient records including demographics, medical history, AED use, and side effects for 1903 adult patients (≥16years of age) newly started on an AED. Cosmetic side effects were determined by patient or physician report in the medical record and included acne, gingival hyperplasia, hair loss, hirsutism, and weight gain. We compared the overall rate of CSEs and intolerable CSEs (ICSEs-CSEs that led to dosage reduction or discontinuation) between different AEDs in both monotherapy and polytherapy. Results: Overall, CSEs occurred in 110/1903 (5.8%) patients and led to intolerability in 70/1903 (3.7%) patients. Weight gain was the most commonly reported CSE (68/1903, 3.6%) and led to intolerability in 63 (3.3%) patients. Alopecia was the second most common patient-reported CSE (36/1903, 1.9%) and was intolerable in 33/1903 (1.7%) patients. Risk factors for CSEs included female sex (7.0% vs. 4.3% in males; p 0.05) and any prior CSE (37% vs. 2.9% in patients without prior CSE; p 0.001). Significantly more CSEs were attributed to valproic acid (59/270; 21.9%; p 0.001) and pregabalin (14/143; 9.8%; p 0.001) than to all other AEDs. Significantly less CSEs were attributed to levetiracetam (7/524; 1.3%; p=0.002). Weight gain was most frequently associated with valproic acid (35/270; 13.0%; p 0.001) and pregabalin (12/143; 8.4%; p 0.001). Hair loss was most commonly reported among patients taking valproic acid (24/270; 8.9%; p 0.001). Finally, gingival hyperplasia was most commonly reported in patients taking phenytoin (10/404; 2.5%; p 0.001). Cosmetic side effects leading to dosage change or discontinuation occurred most frequently with pregabalin and valproic acid compared with all other AEDs (13.3 and 5.6% vs. 2.3%; p 0.001). For patients who had been on an AED in monotherapy (n=677), CSEs and ICSEs were still more likely to be attributed to valproic acid (30.2% and 17.1%, respectively) than to any other AED (both p 0.001). Significance: Weight gain and alopecia were the most common patient-reported CSEs in this study, and weight gain was the most likely cosmetic side effect to result in dosage adjustment or medication discontinuation. Particular attention should be paid to pregabalin, phenytoin, and valproic acid when considering cosmetic side effects. Female patients and patients who have had prior CSE(s) to AED(s) were more likely to report CSEs. Knowledge of specific CSE rates for each AED found in this study may be useful in clinical practice."

A retrospective cohort study design using a large health claims database in the USA from 2006 to 2014 was utilized. A cohort of new user and mutually exclusive users of fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, and bupropion were followed to the first diagnosis of alopecia. The cohort was comprised of 1 025 140 new users of fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, and bupropion, with sertraline the most commonly prescribed (N=190 227) and fluvoxamine (N=3010) the least prescribed. Compared with bupropion, all other antidepressants had a lower risk of hair loss, with fluoxetine and paroxetine having the lowest risk [hazard ratio (HR)=0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63-0.74, HR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.62-0.74, respectively] and fluvoxamine having the highest risk (HR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.64-1.37). Compared with fluoxetine, bupropion had the highest risk of hair loss (HR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.35-1.58, number needed to harm=242 for 2 years) and paroxetine had the lowest risk (HR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.90-1.09). The results of this large population-based cohort study suggest an increase in the risk of hair loss with bupropion compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, whereas paroxetine had the lowest risk."
9_h,health_belief,21335995,Does milk cause acne?,milk causes acne,1.0,"Acne vulgaris, the most common skin disease of western civilization, has evolved to an epidemic affecting more than 85% of adolescents. Acne can be regarded as an indicator disease of exaggerated insulinotropic western nutrition. Especially milk and whey protein-based products contribute to elevations of postprandial insulin and basal insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) plasma levels. It is the evolutional principle of mammalian milk to promote growth and support anabolic conditions for the neonate during the nursing period. Whey proteins are most potent inducers of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide secreted by enteroendocrine K cells which in concert with hydrolyzed whey protein-derived essential amino acids stimulate insulin secretion of pancreatic β-cells. Increased insulin/IGF-I signaling activates the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt pathway, thereby reducing the nuclear content of the transcription factor FoxO1, the key nutrigenomic regulator of acne target genes. Nuclear FoxO1 deficiency has been linked to all major factors of acne pathogenesis, i.e. androgen receptor transactivation, comedogenesis, increased sebaceous lipogenesis, and follicular inflammation. The elimination of the whey protein-based insulinotropic mechanisms of milk will be the most important future challenge for nutrition research. Both, restriction of milk consumption or generation of less insulinotropic milk will have an enormous impact on the prevention of epidemic western diseases like obesity, diabetes mellitus, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and acne."
9_h,health_belief,19243483,Does milk cause acne?,milk causes acne,1.0,"Consumption of cow's milk and cow's milk protein result in changes of the hormonal axis of insulin, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) in humans. Milk consumption raises IGF-1 serum levels in the perinatal period, adolescence and adulthood. During puberty with the physiological onset of increased secretion of growth hormone, IGF-1 serum levels increase and are further enhanced by milk consumption. IGF-1 is a potent mitogen; after binding to its receptor in various tissues, it induces cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. Keratinocytes and sebocytes, as well as the androgen-synthesizing adrenals and gonads, are stimulated by IGF-1. The epidemic incidence of adolescent acne in Western milk-consuming societies can be explained by the increased insulin- and IGF-1-stimulation of sebaceous glands mediated by milk consumption. Acne can be regarded as a model for chronic Western diseases with pathologically increased IGF-1-stimulation. Many other organs, such as the thymus, bones, all glands, and vascular smooth muscle cells as well as neurons are subject to this abnormally increased hormonal stimulation. The milk-induced change of the IGF-1-axis most likely contributes to the development of fetal macrosomia, induction of atopy, accelerated linear growth, atherosclerosis, carcinogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases. Observations of molecular biology are supported by epidemiologic data and unmask milk consumption as a promoter of chronic diseases of Western societies."

The effect of milk on acne has been highly controversial. To examine the association between milk consumption and acne risk, we conducted a meta-analysis of available data. Materials and methods: We carried out comprehensive databases search of PubMed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane Library and identified four cohort studies and nine case-control or cross-sectional studies, including a total of 71 819 participants. We evaluated the pooled odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random effects model. Subgroup analyses on acne severity, milk forms and milk intake levels were performed. Results: Compared with non-consumers, the pooled OR was 1.16 (95% CI 1.09-1.24) for overall milk consumers in all included studies, and 1.17 (95% CI 1.10-1.24) in cohort studies and 1.16 (95% CI 1.09-1.24) in case-control or cross-sectional studies. Subgroup analysis on milk forms determined a stronger association in skim milk consumers (OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.37) than in low-fat consumers (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.08-1.22) and full-fat consumers (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.05-1.21). The pooled OR was greater for high intake level of milk (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24) than medium intake level of milk (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.00-1.17). A subset study of moderate-to-severe acne also found a positive association with milk consumption (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.37), while no statistically significant association was found between mild acne risk and milk consumption (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86-1.51).

In the last decade, the acne-diet connection has been brought back to credibility. Objective: To examine whether high intakes of dairy products in early adolescence is associated with moderate to severe acne in later adolescence. Methods: The study is a longitudinal, questionnaire-based population study of Norwegian adolescents. Students attending the 10th grade (15-16 years old) of compulsory schooling in Oslo in 2000-2001 and the 13th grade (18-19 years old) 3 years later, in 2004, were invited. Dairy product consumption was self-reported at age 15-16 and acne severity was self-assessed and reported at age 18-19. Results: The overall prevalence of moderate to severe acne was 13.9%. High intakes (≥2 glasses per day) of full-fat dairy products were associated with moderate to severe acne. In boys with exclusively high intakes of full-fat dairy products, the odds ratio for acne was 4.81 (1.59-14.56). A high total intake of dairy products was associated with acne in girls (OR 1.80, 1.02-3.16). No significant associations were found between acne and intake of semi-skimmed or skimmed dairy products, and not with moderate intakes of any fat variety of dairy products.

The objective was to determine dietary effects of lactoferrin-enriched fermented milk on patients with acne vulgaris, an inflammatory skin condition. Methods: Patients 18 to 30 y of age were randomly assigned to ingest fermented milk with 200 mg of lactoferrin daily (n = 18, lactoferrin group) or fermented milk only (n = 18, placebo group) in a 12-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Acne lesion counts and grade were assessed at monthly visits. The condition of the skin by hydration, sebum and pH, and skin surface lipids was assessed at baseline and 12 wk. Results: Acne showed improvement in the lactoferrin group by significant decreases in inflammatory lesion count by 38.6%, total lesion count by 23.1%, and acne grade by 20.3% compared with the placebo group at 12 wk. Furthermore, sebum content in the lactoferrin group was decreased by 31.1% compared with the placebo group. The amount of total skin surface lipids decreased in both groups. However, of the major lipids, amounts of triacylglycerols and free fatty acids decreased in the lactoferrin group, whereas the amount of free fatty acids decreased only in the placebo group. The decreased amount of triacylglycerols in the lactoferrin group was significantly correlated with decreases in serum content, acne lesion counts, and acne grade. No alterations in skin hydration or pH were noted in either group. Conclusion: Lactoferrin-enriched fermented milk ameliorates acne vulgaris with a selective decrease of triacylglycerols in skin surface lipids."

Purpose: We summarized earlier data on the association between milk and dairy intake and risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture through a meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic literature search of relevant reports published in PubMed, ISI (Web of Science), EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar until August 2018 was conducted. Results: Total dairy intake was protectively associated with reduced risk of osteoporosis based on cross-sectional and case-control studies (0.63; 95% CI: 0.55-0.73). Milk consumption was not associated with the risk of osteoporosis (overall RR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.57-1.08). In non-linear dose-response meta-analysis, increase intake of dairy (at the level of 0 to 250 grams per day) was associated with a reduced risk of osteoporosis ( P nonlinearty = 0.005). Meta-regression of included studies revealed an inverse linear association between dairy and milk intake and risk of osteoporosis; such that every additional 200-gram intake of dairy and milk was associated with a 22% and 37% reduced risk of osteoporosis, respectively. In terms of hip fracture, milk consumption was associated with a 25% reduced risk of hip fracture only in cross-sectional and case-control studies (overall RR = 0.75; 95%CI: 0.57-0.99). In linear meta-regression, every additional 200-gram milk intake per day was associated with a 9% greater risk of hip fracture in cohort studies. Conclusion: Despite an inverse association between milk and dairy intake and risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture in cross-sectional and case-control studies, no such association was seen in cohort studies. Given the advantages of the cohort over case-control studies, we concluded that a greater intake of milk and dairy products was not associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture."
10_h,health_belief,27726930,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,"Cow's milk is often severely criticized as a cause of multiple health problems, including an increased risk of fractures. A close look at the scientific literature shows a striking contradiction. On the one hand, experimental studies of surrogate markers (e.g., bone turnover markers and bone mineral density [BMD]) usually indicate benefits from drinking cow's milk. On the other, the findings from epidemiological studies are conflicting and disconcerting. In all age groups, including children and postmenopausal women, consuming cow's milk, powdered milk supplements, or whey protein is associated with a slower bone turnover and unchanged or higher BMD values. These benefits are particularly marked in populations where calcium deficiency is prevalent, for instance in Asian countries. No interventional studies have addressed the fracture risk potentially associated with drinking cow's milk. The only available data come from epidemiological observational studies, whose results are conflicting, with a lower fracture risk in some cases and no difference or a higher risk in others. Several hypotheses have been offered to explain these findings, such as a deleterious effect of D-galactose, lactose intolerance, and acid overload. Epidemiological studies face many obstacles when seeking to detect effects of a single food, particularly the multiplicity of interactions among foods. Furthermore, reliable dietary intake data must be collected over prolonged periods, often long before the occurrence of a fracture, and defective recall may therefore introduce a major yet often unrecognized bias, particularly in populations where calcium deficiency is uncommon. To date, there is no conclusive evidence that we should modify our currently high level of consumption of cow's milk."
10_h,health_belief,22081694,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,"Recently the lay press has claimed a hypothetical association among dairy product consumption, generation of dietary acid, and harm to human health. This theoretical association is based on the idea that the protein and phosphate in milk and dairy products make them acid-producing foods, which cause our bodies to become acidified, promoting diseases of modern civilization. Some authors have suggested that dairy products are not helpful and perhaps detrimental to bone health because higher osteoporotic fracture incidence is observed in countries with higher dairy product consumption. However, scientific evidence does not support any of these claims. Milk and dairy products neither produce acid upon metabolism nor cause metabolic acidosis, and systemic pH is not influenced by diet. Observations of higher dairy product intake in countries with prevalent osteoporosis do not hold when urban environments are compared, likely due to physical labor in rural locations. Milk and other dairy products continue to be a good source of dietary protein and other nutrients. Key teaching points: Measurement of an acidic pH urine does not reflect metabolic acidosis or an adverse health condition. The modern diet, and dairy product consumption, does not make the body acidic. Alkaline diets alter urine pH but do not change systemic pH. Net acid excretion is not an important influence of calcium metabolism. Milk is not acid producing. Dietary phosphate does not have a negative impact on calcium metabolism, which is contrary to the acid-ash hypothesis."

Main outcome measures: Bone density at the hip and lumbar spine measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Main results: There was a statistically significant graded association between increasing lifetime intake of caffeinated coffee and decreasing BMD at both the hip and spine, independent of age, obesity, parity, years since menopause, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, estrogen, thiazides, and calcium supplements. Bone density did not vary by lifetime coffee intake in women who reported drinking at least one glass of milk per day during most of their adult lives. Conclusions: Lifetime caffeinated coffee intake equivalent to two cups per day is associated with decreased bone density in older women who do not drink milk on a daily basis."

Chocolate is a rich source of antioxidant and antiinflammatory flavonoids and dietary minerals with the potential to benefit bone health. However, other chocolate constituents such as cocoa butter, sugar, and methylxanthines may be detrimental to bone. Human studies investigating the role of chocolate consumption on serum bone markers and bone mineral density (BMD) have been inconsistent. A contributing factor is likely the different composition and thereby the nutrient and bioactive content among chocolate types. White and milk chocolate are high in sugar and low in flavonoids and most minerals. Dark chocolate (45-85% cocoa solids) is high in flavonoids, most minerals, and low in sugar with ≥70% cocoa solids resulting in higher fat and methylxanthine content. The aim of this review was to examine the relationship between chocolate consumption and its constiuents, including flavonoid content, on bone health and osteoporosis risk. Studies showed postmenopausal women had no bone effects at moderate chocolate intakes, whereas adolescents consuming chocolate had greater longitudinal bone growth. Based on flavonoid and mineral content, unsweetened cocoa powder appeared to be the best option followed by dark chocolate with higher cocoa content in terms of supporting and preserving bone health. Determining dietary recommendations for chocolate consumption relative to bone health is important because of the growing popularity of chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, and an expected increase in consumption owing to suggestions of health benefits against various degenerative diseases."
10_h,health_belief,7891547,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,"Milk-alkali syndrome can be caused by ingesting large amounts of calcium carbonate. Coincident with the promotion of calcium carbonate as treatment for both dyspepsia and osteoporosis, milk-alkali syndrome is now a common cause of hypercalcemia severe enough to require admission to the hospital. The syndrome accounted for less than 2% of such admissions before 1990, but from 1990 through 1993, it was the cause of hypercalcemia for over 12% of these patients. Only primary hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia of malignancy (excluding multiple myeloma) are more common. The diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome is made almost entirely based on the patient's history; careful attention to dietary practices and over-the-counter drug use is required, as numerous over-the-counter medications contain calcium carbonate. Modern assays for PTH demonstrate the expected suppression of PTH by hypercalcemia. Nonetheless, measurement of PTH must be performed in a timely manner as treatment with intravenous saline may result in hypocalcemia and elevated PTH soon after admission. Given the pathophysiology of milk-alkali syndrome compared to other causes of hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia with rebound hyperparathyroidism is probably unique to milk-alkali syndrome."
10_h,health_belief,24093748,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,"Osteoporosis is a progressive disease of the skeleton characterised by bone fragility due to a reduction in bone mass and possibly to alteration in bone architecture that lead to a propensity to fracture with minimum trauma. Most osteoporotic fractures occur at locations rich in trabecular or cancellous bone and usually related to post menopausal women. Recently, silymarin received attention due to its alternative beneficial effect on bone formation. It is a mixture of flavonoids with powerful antioxidant properties. This review focuses on the use of milk thistle or silymarin for the treatment of osteoporosis that may be related to fracture bone. Silymarin shows potent antioxidant herb that may modulate multiple genes in favour of helping to build bone and prevent bone loss. In the mouse fracture healing model, silymarin supplementation improved tibial healing with elevated BMD and serum levels of ALP and osteocalcin. Silymarin also demonstrated clear estrogenic antiosteoporotic effects in bone structure. Silymarin appears to play a crucial role to prevent bone loss and might regulate osteogenesis and may be beneficial for fracture healing. If silymarin is considered for the use of post menopausal women, it may be used for the treatment of osteoporosis. It would be of great benefit to postmenopausal women to develop an oestrogen antagonist that is as potent and efficacious as oestrogen in preventing bone loss without the major side effect associated with HRT."

Objective: This review aimed to assess the scientific evidence mainly from meta-analyses of observational studies and randomised controlled trials, on dairy intake and risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cancer, and all-cause mortality. Results: The most recent evidence suggested that intake of milk and dairy products was associated with reduced risk of childhood obesity. In adults, intake of dairy products was shown to improve body composition and facilitate weight loss during energy restriction. In addition, intake of milk and dairy products was associated with a neutral or reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly stroke. Furthermore, the evidence suggested a beneficial effect of milk and dairy intake on bone mineral density but no association with risk of bone fracture. Among cancers, milk and dairy intake was inversely associated with colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and breast cancer, and not associated with risk of pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, or lung cancer, while the evidence for prostate cancer risk was inconsistent. Finally, consumption of milk and dairy products was not associated with all-cause mortality. Calcium-fortified plant-based drinks have been included as an alternative to dairy products in the nutrition recommendations in several countries. However, nutritionally, cow's milk and plant-based drinks are completely different foods, and an evidence-based conclusion on the health value of the plant-based drinks requires more studies in humans. Conclusion: The totality of available scientific evidence supports that intake of milk and dairy products contribute to meet nutrient recommendations, and may protect against the most prevalent chronic diseases, whereas very few adverse effects have been reported."
10_h,health_belief,12915959,Does milk cause osteoporosis?,milk causes osteoporosis,0.0,"Dietary studies often report low calcium intake amongst post-menopausal Malaysian women and calcium deficiency has been implicated as part of the etiology of age-related bone loss leading to osteoporosis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of high calcium skimmed milk (Anlene Gold, New Zealand Milk, Wellington, New Zealand) to reduce bone loss in Chinese postmenopausal women. Two hundred subjects aged 55-65 years and who were more than 5 years postmenopausal were randomized to a milk group and control group. The milk group consumed 50 g of high calcium skimmed milk powder daily, which contained 1200 mg calcium (taken as two glasses of milk a day). The control group continued with their usual diet. Using repeated measures ANCOVA, the milk supplement was found to significantly reduce the percentage of bone loss at the total body compared to the control group at 24 months (control -1.04%, milk -0.13%; P 0.001). At the lumbar spine, the percentage of bone loss in the control group was significantly higher (-0.90%) when compared to the milk (-0.13%) supplemented group at 24 months (P 0.05). Similarly, milk supplementation reduced the percentage of bone loss at the femoral neck (control -1.21%, milk 0.51%) (P 0.01) and total hip (control -2.17%, milk -0.50%) (P 0.01). The supplemented group did not experience any significant weight gain over the 24 months. The serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level improved significantly (P 0.01) from 69.1 +/- 16.1 nmol/l at baseline to 86.4 +/- 22.0 nmol/l at 24 months in the milk group. In conclusion, ingestion of high calcium skimmed milk was effective in reducing the rate of bone loss at clinically important lumbar spine and hip sites in postmenopausal Chinese women in Malaysia. Supplementing with milk had additional benefits of improving the serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D status of the subjects."

This study was designed to reflect the trend of replacing milk with carbonated beverages in a group of young men on a low-calcium diet and studies the effects of this replacement on calcium homeostasis and bone turnover. This controlled crossover intervention study included 11 healthy men (22-29 years) who were given a low-calcium basic diet in two 10-day intervention periods with an intervening 10-day washout. During one period, they drank 2.5 l of Coca Cola per day and during the other period 2.5 l of semi-skimmed milk. Serum concentrations of calcium, phosphate, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D), osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP) and cross-linked C-telopeptides (CTX), plasma intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) and urinary cross-linked N-telopeptides (NTX) were determined at baseline and endpoint of each intervention period. An increase in serum phosphate (P 0.001), 1,25(OH)2D (P 0.001), PTH (P=0.046) and osteocalcin (P 0.001) was observed in the cola period compared to the milk period. Also, bone resorption was significantly increased following the cola period, seen as increased serum CTX (P 0.001) and urinary NTX (P 0.001) compared to the milk period. No changes were observed in serum concentrations of calcium or B-ALP. This study demonstrates that over a 10-day period high intake of cola with a low-calcium diet induces increased bone turnover compared to a high intake of milk with a low-calcium diet. Thus, the trend towards a replacement of milk with cola and other soft drinks, which results in a low calcium intake, may negatively affect bone health as indicated by this short-term study."

The aim of this study is to investigate correlations between individual subjective and objective parameters of stable NP disease. Methods: 65 NP patients scored their sinonasal symptoms on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and questionnaires (SNOT-22 and SF-36). Peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) measurement, Sniffinatm Sticks (SS) smell test, blood analysis for eosinophilia, total IgE and culture for Staphylococcus aureus (SA) were performed. Results: VAS scores for nasal blockage correlated with the SNOT-22 and SF-36 scores, which was not observed for VAS of other symptoms. VAS scores for nasal blockage correlated well with PNIF values as well as VAS scores for smell dysfunction and SS results (both p 0.001). NP size correlated with VAS scores for nasal blockage (p 0.01) but not with VAS for other symptoms. NP size showed an inverse correlation with PNIF and SS scores (both p 0.05). Blood eosinophilia correlated with subjective smell reduction (p 0.05). The presence of SA or total IgE levels were not associated with symptoms of NP disease. Conclusion: PNIF and SS are good tools to evaluate symptoms of nasal obstruction and smell reduction in NP disease. Nasal blockage is the only symptom that correlates well with NP size and SNOT-22 scores, whereas smell reduction correlates with blood eosinophilia."
11_h,health_belief,22794680,Does nasal polyp cause nasal block?,nasal polyp causes nasal block,1.0,"Nasal polyps are inflammatory outgrowths of paranasal sinus mucosa caused by chronic mucosal inflammation that typically arise from the middle meatus and ethmoid region. The main symptoms of nasal polyps are perennial nasal congestion, nasal obstruction, and anosmia or hyposmia. Unlike patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps who present with headache and facial pain, patients with nasal polyps typically do not complain of those symptoms. Nasal polyps appear as semitranslucent, pale gray growths in the nasal cavity in contrast to pink or erythematous adjacent mucosa. Nasal polyps occur more frequently in patients with persistent asthma, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), CRS, and cystic fibrosis. Children with nasal polyps should be evaluated for cystic fibrosis. Churg-Strauss syndrome and ciliary dyskinesia also may be associated with nasal polyps. Nasal polyps have increased numbers of activated eosinophils, mast cells, and IgE. Staphylococcal superantigens may play a role in the Th2 type of chronic eosinophilic inflammation observed in nasal polyps. Dysfunction of the epithelial barrier in nasal polyps causing reduced levels of antimicrobial proteins has been described. Topical nasal steroids are the treatment of choice. They significantly decrease polyp size, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and increase nasal airflow. Short courses of oral steroids may be needed to reduce polyp size followed by maintenance therapy with intranasal steroids. Surgery is reserved for cases when polyps cause severe obstruction, recurrent sinusitis, and for patients who have failed medical therapy. Aspirin desensitization may decrease the requirement for polypectomies and sinus surgery in patients with AERD."
11_h,health_belief,31690375,Does nasal polyp cause nasal block?,nasal polyp causes nasal block,1.0,"Rhinosinusitis is defined as inflammation of one or more of the paranasal sinuses and affects approximately 12% of the population. Acute rhinosinusitis is defined as symptoms that last 12 weeks, and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as symptoms that last &gt; 12 weeks. CRS is divided into three groups: CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. Nasal polyps are inflammatory outgrowths of paranasal sinus mucosa caused by chronic mucosal inflammation and are present in 20% of patients with CRS. Nasal polyps typically present with nasal congestion, nasal obstruction, and anosmia or hyposmia, and occur more frequently in patients with persistent asthma, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), CRS, and cystic fibrosis. The sinus cavities are lined with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelial cells interspersed with mucous goblet cells. Cilia continuously sweep the mucous toward the ostial openings and are important in maintaining the proper environment of the sinus cavities. The frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoid sinuses drain into the ostiomeatal unit of the middle meatus. The posterior ethmoid sinuses and superior sphenoid sinuses drain into the sphenoethmoid recess of the superior meatus. Most acute sinus infections are caused by viruses, and, therefore, it is not surprising that the majority of patients improve within 2 weeks without antibiotic treatment. A bacterial infection should be considered if symptoms worsen or fail to improve within 7-10 days. Combining an intranasal corticosteroid with an antibiotic reduces symptoms more effectively than antibiotics alone. Topical nasal steroids are the treatment of choice for nasal polyps. They significantly decrease polyp size, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea, and increase nasal airflow. Short courses of oral steroids may be needed to reduce polyp size, followed by maintenance therapy with topical steroids. Surgery is reserved for patients in which polyps cause severe obstruction or recurrent sinusitis and for patients for whom medical therapy has failed. Aspirin desensitization may decrease the requirement for polypectomies and sinus surgery in patients with AERD."

This evidence based position paper describes what is known about rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps, offers evidence based recommendations on diagnosis and treatment, and considers how we can make progress with research in this area. Rhinitis and sinusitis usually coexist and are concurrent in most individuals; thus, the correct terminology is now rhinosinusitis. Rhinosinusitis (including nasal polyps) is defined as inflammation of the nose and the paranasal sinuses characterised by two or more symptoms, one of which should be either nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip), +/- facial pain/pressure, +/- reduction or loss of smell; and either endoscopic signs of polyps and/or mucopurulent discharge primarily from middle meatus and/or; oedema/mucosal obstruction primarily in middle meatus, and/or CT changes showing mucosal changes within the ostiomeatal complex and/or sinuses. The paper gives different definitions for epidemiology, first line and second line treatment and for research. Furthermore the paper describes the anatomy and (patho)physiology, epidemiology and predisposing factors, inflammatory mechanisms, evidence based diagnosis, medical and surgical treatment in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis in adults and children. Evidence based schemes for diagnosis and treatment are given for the first and second line clinicians. Moreover attention is given to complications and socio-economic cost of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. Last but not least the relation to the lower airways is discussed."

For individual examinations, there is no gold standard method that can discriminate work-related discomfort from other causes of rhinitis. Objectives: Studies of the effects of occupation on farmers' health have mainly focused on lower airways; few studies have examined effects on upper airways. This study investigated nasal functions in three groups of farmers (swine, milk and grain producers) and a control group using different methods, suitable for field studies. Subjects and methods: Health-related complaints were examined and several functional tests, such as expirogram, olfactory threshold test, acoustic rhinometry, nasal lavage with biomarkers of inflammation (eosinophilic cationic proteins (ECP), myeloperoxidase (MPO), tryptase, albumin) and allergy tests were performed. The different tests were correlated to nasal complaints and to each other. Results: Nasal blockage complaints were more common among farmers; overall, nasal polyps were more frequent in grain producers. Objective parameters showed more pronounced mucosal swelling in farmers and higher concentrations of ECP in nasal lavage compared with controls. Lung function, olfactory threshold, atopy frequency and allergen-specific IgE to the storage mite Lepidoglyphus destructor did not differ between farmers and controls. Mucosal swelling measured with acoustic rhinometry was more pronounced in subjects with nasal complaints, hypersensitivity, nasal polyps and symptoms from lower airways. There was a correlation between biomarkers in nasal lavage (MPO, albumin and ECP)."

The aim of this study was investigate the effect of nasal obstruction related to chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis on cognitive functions. Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis causing bilateral total or near total nasal obstruction were enrolled in the study. Symptoms of nasal congestion, loss of smell, postnasal drip, headaches, snoring, concentration difficulties and blunted affect were evaluated by Visual Analog Scale. Brief symptom inventory test, Stroop test, visual aural digit span, serial digit learning test and P300 test were used to evaluate cognitive functions. Three months after treatment, the tests done before surgery were repeated and the results were compared. A total of 30 patients were included in the study. On the Visual Analog Scale, all symptoms showed significant postoperative improvement in all patients ( p 0.001 for all symptoms). Preoperative nasal congestion accompanied with impaired concentration were detected in 27 patients (90%), and these symptoms recovered in all these patients after treatment ( p = 0.035) (correlation coefficient 0.4). Only 22 patients completed the neuropsychological tests. The mean preoperative Stroop test (23.16 ± 5.30), visual aural digit span test (24.68 ± 3.52), and serial digit learning test (16.18 ± 5.35) scores were showed significant improvement compared with mean postoperative Stroop test (21.12 ± 5.69), visual aural digit span test (26.45 ± 2.98), and serial digit learning test (19.31 ± 4.47) scores ( p = 0.047, p = 0.022, p = 0.005 respectively). The postoperative P300 latency values improved in 19 (63%) patients. The preoperative and postoperative latency values for P300 showed a significant difference ( p = 0.029), whereas the preoperative and postoperative amplitude values for P300 did not differ ( p = 0.096).

Before surgery, the leading bothersome symptoms were olfactory disturbances (7.74 ± 2.81) and nasal obstruction (6.66 ± 2.28). After surgery (6th week and 7th month), there was a clear improvement of all symptoms including nasal obstruction, olfactory disturbances, anterior rhinorrhea, postnasal discharge, facial pain/headache and cough in comparison to baseline (p 0.0001). Nasal obstruction was the most improved symptom (effect size of 2.24). At 7th post-operative month, the sense of smell continued to improve slightly. By contrast, the postnasal discharge score that was significantly improved at 6th post-operative week tended to worsen at 7 months (p = 0.0045). Before surgery, strong psychosocial impacts were observed in association with nasal obstruction and anterior rhinorrhea. The physical impacts of each symptom were proportionally correlated to the symptom score before and after surgery. The quality of life (QOL) related to each symptom was clearly better at 6 weeks and remained steady at 7 months after surgery. In conclusion, olfactory disorders and postnasal rhinorrhea were the main remaining symptoms after sinus surgery despite a global improvement of symptoms and quality of life. The earlier time point to stabilize QOL outcomes of endoscopic sinus surgery could be suggested at 6 weeks after surgery."

Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits signalling of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, key drivers of type 2 inflammation, and has been approved for use in atopic dermatitis and asthma. In these two studies, we aimed to assess efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with CRSwNP despite previous treatment with systemic corticosteroids, surgery, or both. Methods: LIBERTY NP SINUS-24 and LIBERTY NP SINUS-52 were two multinational, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies assessing dupilumab added to standard of care in adults with severe CRSwNP. SINUS-24 was done in 67 centres in 13 countries, and SINUS-52 was done in 117 centres in 14 countries. Eligible patients were 18 years or older with bilateral CRSwNP and symptoms despite intranasal corticosteroid use, receiving systemic corticosteroids in the preceding 2 years, or having had sinonasal surgery. Patients in SINUS-24 were randomly assigned (1:1) to subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg or placebo every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. Patients in SINUS-52 were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks for 52 weeks, dupilumab every 2 weeks for 24 weeks and then every 4 weeks for the remaining 28 weeks, or placebo every 2 weeks for 52 weeks. All patients were randomly assigned centrally with a permuted block randomisation schedule. Randomisation was stratified by asthma or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease status at screening, previous surgery at screening, and country. Patients with or without comorbid asthma were included. Coprimary endpoints were changes from baseline to week 24 in nasal polyp score (NPS), nasal congestion or obstruction, and sinus Lund-Mackay CT scores (a coprimary endpoint in Japan), done in an intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in a pooled population of both dupilumab groups in SINUS-52 up to week 24 and the dupilumab group in SINUS-24 and the placebo groups in both studies until week 24.

Findings: Between Dec 5, 2016, and Aug 3, 2017, 276 patients were enrolled in SINUS-24, with 143 in the dupilumab group and 133 in the placebo group receiving at least one study drug dose. Between Nov 28, 2016, and Aug 28, 2017, 448 patients were enrolled in SINUS-52, with 150 receiving at least one dose of dupilumab every 2 weeks, 145 receiving at least one dose of dupilumab every 2 weeks for 24 weeks and every 4 weeks until week 52, and 153 receiving at least one dose of placebo. Dupilumab significantly improved the coprimary endpoints in both studies. At 24 weeks, least squares mean difference in NPS of dupilumab treatment versus placebo was -2·06 (95% CI -2·43 to -1·69; p 0·0001) in SINUS-24 and -1·80 (-2·10 to -1·51; p 0·0001) in SINUS-52; difference in nasal congestion or obstruction score was -0·89 (-1·07 to -0·71; p 0·0001) in SINUS-24 and -0·87 (-1·03 to -0·71; p 0·0001) in SINUS-52; and difference in Lund-Mackay CT scores was -7·44 (-8·35 to -6·53; p 0·0001) in SINUS-24 and -5·13 (-5·80 to -4·46; p 0·0001) in SINUS-52. The most common adverse events (nasopharyngitis, worsening of nasal polyps and asthma, headache, epistaxis, and injection-site erythema) were more frequent with placebo. Interpretation: In adult patients with severe CRSwNP, dupilumab reduced polyp size, sinus opacification, and severity of symptoms and was well tolerated. These results support the benefits of adding dupilumab to daily standard of care for patients with severe CRSwNP who otherwise have few therapeutic options.

Therapeutic options are targeted to relax prostate smooth muscle and/or reduce prostate enlargement. Areas covered: This article reviews the major preclinical and clinical data on PDE5 inhibitors with a specific focus on tadalafil. It includes details of the role of the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) - PDE5 pathway in the LUT organs (bladder and prostate) in addition to the available data on tadalafil in patients with LUTS secondary to BPH with or without erectile dysfunction (ED). Expert opinion: Preclinical and clinical data have clearly demonstrated that PDE5 inhibitors induce bladder and prostate relaxation, which contributes to the improvement seen in storage symptoms in both animal models of bladder and prostate hypercontractility. Tadalafil is effective both as a monotherapy and add-on therapy in patients with LUTS secondary to BPH. Furthermore, as LUTS-BPH and ED are urological disorders that commonly coexist in aging men, tadalafil is more advantageous than α1-adrenoceptors and should be used as the first option. Tadalafil is a safe and tolerable therapy and unlike α1- adrenoceptors and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, which can cause sexual dysfunctions, tadalafil improves sexual function."

We assessed the effects of tadalafil 5 mg coadministered with finasteride 5 mg during 26 weeks on lower urinary tract symptoms and sexual symptoms. Materials and methods: In an international, randomized, double-blind, parallel study of men 45 years old or older who were 5α-reductase inhibitor naïve and had an I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) of 13 or greater and prostate volume 30 ml or greater, 350 were treated with placebo/finasteride and 345 received tadalafil/finasteride for 26 weeks. Changes in lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia were assessed with the I-PSS, erectile dysfunction improvements were assessed with the IIEF-EF (International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function) in sexually active men and safety was assessed by evaluating adverse events. Results: Least squares mean changes from baseline in I-PSS after 4, 12 and 26 weeks of tadalafil/finasteride coadministration were -4.0, -5.2 and -5.5, respectively. Corresponding values for placebo/finasteride coadministration were -2.3, -3.8 and -4.5 (p ≤ 0.022 at all visits favoring tadalafil/finasteride coadministration). I-PSS subscores (storage and voiding) and quality of life index were also numerically improved with tadalafil/finasteride coadministration. Least squares mean changes from baseline in IIEF-EF with tadalafil/finasteride coadministration were 3.7 after 4 weeks, and 4.7 after 12 and 26 weeks. Corresponding values for placebo/finasteride coadministration were -1.1, 0.6 and -0.0 (p 0.001 at all visits favoring tadalafil/finasteride coadministration). Tadalafil/finasteride coadministration was well tolerated and most adverse events were mild/moderate.

Material and methods: A randomized prospective study on patients diagnosed with LUTS secondary to BPH with 50 patients in each group. Duration of the study is 12 weeks. Drug was given 30 min after dinner. Patients were assessed at baseline 1, 4 and 12 weeks with efficacy measures being Maximum flow rate (Qmax), Postvoid residual urine (PVR), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Prostate Symptom Score Quality of life (IPSS QoL) and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) scoring. Statistical analysis was done using paired sample t test and independent sample t test. Results: In tadalafil group, 12 (24%) patients were having mild LUTS and 38 (76%) were having moderate LUTS. In tamsulosin group, 9 (18%) patients were having mild LUTS and 41 (82%) patients were having moderate LUTS. Seventeen patients in tadalafil group had associated ED (erectile dysfunction) and 13 patients had associated ED in tamsulosin group.

Patients and methods: We conducted an integrated analysis of 12 phase II-III randomized, double-blind and/or open-label extension studies to evaluate short-term (12-26 weeks) efficacy and short- and longer-term (42-52 weeks) safety in men aged 75 years vs men aged ≥75 years. All men received once-daily tadalafil 5 mg or placebo. The efficacy outcome was International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Safety measurements included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation, serious AEs (SAEs), and cardiovascular AEs. All analyses were intention-to-treat. Changes from baseline to efficacy endpoint and differences in changes between treatment groups were estimated as least-squares means using analysis of covariance models. Results: Change in the mean IPSS was significantly different in men aged 75 years vs those aged ≥75 years across tadalafil and placebo groups (treatment-by-age interaction P = 0.034). Tadalafil was not statistically significantly better than placebo in men aged ≥75 years, but effect size varied between studies. Maintenance of efficacy with tadalafil was observed across age groups. Short-term tadalafil safety findings for men aged 75 vs ≥75 years included: TEAEs (52 [33.8%] vs 503 [30.1%]), AEs leading to discontinuation (3 [1.9%] vs 50 [3.0%]), SAEs (4 [2.6%] vs 15 [0.9%]) and cardiovascular AEs (4 [2.6%] vs 30 [1.8%]). Long-term tadalafil safety data did not reveal clinically relevant differences between age groups. Limitations include exclusion of men with serious co-existing conditions and limited sample sizes of men aged ≥75 years. Conclusions: Efficacy with once-daily tadalafil 5 mg in the treatment of LUTS/BPH differed between men aged 75 vs ≥75 years, with significant efficacy in the 75-year age group. The older age group had more concomitant diseases and used more drugs, which may have reduced efficacy. The small sample size precluded uni-/multivariate analyses to assess plausible interference from confounding factors. Tadalafil had a reassuring safety profile and no evidence of increased cardiovascular AEs in aging men."
12_h,health_belief,19428174,Does cialis treat enlarged prostrate?,cialis treats enlarged prostrate,1.0,"Background: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and erectile dysfunction (ED) are highly prevalent in aging men and are strongly linked. Alpha₁-blockers such as alfuzosin are effective monotherapies for LUTS. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors such as tadalafil are the first-line treatment for ED. Both drugs act by two different mechanisms of action on common urogenital target organs and, thus, may have additive effects. Objectives: We evaluated in vitro the effects of alfuzosin, tadalafil, and the combination of both on human detrusor and prostatic smooth muscle. Design, setting, and participants: Prostatic and bladder tissue were obtained from patients (n=20 and n=17, respectively) undergoing cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer. Measurements: In organ baths, isolated prostatic strips and isolated bladder strips were incubated with vehicle, tadalafil (10⁻⁶ M and 10⁻⁵ M), alfuzosin (3×10⁻⁸ M or 10⁻⁶ M and 10⁻⁵ M) or a combination. Concentration-response curves (CRCs) to norepinephrine were generated on prostatic strips and detrusor strips precontracted with carbachol. Strips were also submitted to electrical field stimulation (EFS). Results and limitations: When alfuzosin and tadalafil were combined, the maximal relaxation to norepinephrine on carbachol-precontracted detrusor strips was significantly increased compared with tadalafil alone, and EFS-induced detrusor contractions were better inhibited compared with each compound alone. Tadalafil significantly inhibited norepinephrine-induced prostatic strip contractions by reducing the maximal effect, whereas alfuzosin shifted the CRC of norepinephrine to the right. Combining both tadalafil and alfuzosin resulted in a greater relaxant effect. Likewise, the combination was more effective at reducing EFS-induced contractions compared with each compound alone. Conclusions: The combination of alfuzosin and tadalafil exerts an additive effect of inhibiting adrenergic smooth muscle tone of prostatic tissue and EFS-induced detrusor contractions and conversely, of enhancing adrenergic relaxation of detrusor precontracted with carbachol. These experiments provide experimental support for the clinical investigation of the combination of α1-blockers and PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of LUTS."

We post hoc characterized changes in the maximum urinary flow rate using integrated data from 4 international, placebo controlled studies of tadalafil once daily for lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Materials and methods: After a 4-week placebo lead-in period 1,500 men were randomized to tadalafil 5 mg or placebo for 12 weeks. Data were analyzed using ANCOVA. Maximum urinary flow rate values were rank transformed for analysis. Results: Baseline maximum urinary flow rate data were available on 1,371 men with a mean age of 63.1 years and end point data were available on 1,197. Tadalafil 5 mg significantly increased maximum urinary flow vs placebo (median 1.1 vs 0.4 ml per second, p = 0.003). At a baseline voided volume of 125 to less than 250 ml the median change in the maximum urinary flow rate was 0.9 and 1.2 ml per second (p = 0.142) in 731 patients, at a baseline of 250 to 450 ml the change was -0.3 and 0.7 ml per second (p = 0.011) in 428, and at a baseline of greater than 450 ml the change was -0.2 and 2.0 ml per second (p = 0.186) in 38 for placebo and tadalafil, respectively. The difference was 0.3, 1.0 and 2.2 ml per second, respectively. At a baseline maximum urinary flow rate of greater than 15 ml per second in 128 patients the median flow rate change was -2.1 and -0.8 ml per second (p = 0.246), at a maximum of 10 to 15 ml per second in 522 the change was 0.2 and 0.8 ml per second (p = 0.044), and at a maximum of less than 10 ml per second in 547 the change was 1.2 and 1.8 ml per second (p = 0.189) for placebo and tadalafil, respectively. Tadalafil improved I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) voiding subscores significantly vs placebo across all baseline maximum urinary flow subgroups (each p 0.001). Conclusions: This integrated analysis revealed a small but statistically significant median maximum urinary flow rate improvement for tadalafil vs placebo.

Methods: An international, randomized, double-blind, parallel study was carried out in men aged ≥45 years who were 5-alpha reductase inhibitor naïve, and had an International Prostate Symptom Score ≥13 and prostate volume ≥30 mL; 350 men received placebo/finasteride and 345 received tadalafil/finasteride over 26 weeks. Treatment satisfaction was assessed per protocol using the Treatment Satisfaction Scale-Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. Responder cut-offs, analyzed post-hoc were total International Prostate Symptom Score improvement ≥3 points or ≥25% from randomization. Results: Baseline patient characteristics were generally comparable between responders and non-responders. The proportion of patients with an International Prostate Symptom Score improvement ≥3 points with tadalafil/finasteride and placebo/finasteride, respectively, at week 4 was 57.0% and 47.9% (OR 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.97), at week 12 was 68.8% and 60.7% (OR 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.07-2.05) and at week 26 was 71.4% and 70.2% (OR 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.81-1.61); for IPSS change ≥25%, the corresponding proportions were 44.8% and 32.9% (OR 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.21-2.28), 55.5% and 51.9% (OR 1.18, 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.62), and 62.0% and 58.3% (OR 1.23, 95% confidence interval 0.89-1.70).

Recent findings: Daily tadalafil, in particular 5 mg, according to retrieved studies, appears to be both safe and effective in treating LUTS/BPH and ED, compared with placebo or tamsulosin. The combination of daily tadalafil 5 mg and tamsulosin 0.4 mg allows a better improvement of LUTS compared with both the monotherapies, even if with an increased, but acceptable and tolerated, adverse events rate. After discontinuation of tamsulosin or tadalafil in patients previously treated with their combination, the improvement of LUTS retains significance compared with baseline. Tadalafil 5 mg should be considered a primary treatment option for patients with LUTS/BPH and ED. Evidence highlight an excellent tolerability, safety, and effectiveness profile, both alone or in combination with tamsulosin 0.4 mg. A better efficacy on LUTS relief has been observed for combination therapy, preserving also sexual function. The further switch to monotherapy allows to preserve LUTS relief, but tadalafil only is able to retain ED improvement.

Recent findings: Transient-altered breath smell usually reflects the effects of foodstuffs, whereas longstanding halitosis is almost always because of oral disease such as gingivitis or periodontitis. There is, however, increasing evidence that upper gastrointestinal tract disease may give rise to halitosis and that extracts of foodstuffs may be future therapeutic agents for the treatment of halitosis derived from the mouth or upper gastrointestinal tract. Summary: There is some interplay between the halitosis and the gastrointestinal tract, and it is possible that the therapy of halitosis may be aided by investigations of the effects of foodstuffs upon bacteria that give rise to volatile sulphur compounds."

Only limited data are available on the effect of different food items on tongue coating and halitosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single consumption of food with high fiber content versus low fiber content on halitosis parameters. Based on a randomized clinical cross-over study, 20 subjects were examined over a period of 2.5 hours after consumption of a high-fiber and a low-fiber meal. The determination of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) was performed using a Halimeter, and the organoleptic assessment of halitosis was done on the basis of a distance index. The tongue coating was determined using a modified Winkel index, and the mouth sensation was evaluated subjectively by the subjects. In both the test and the control phase, a statistically significant reduction of all selected parameters was detected (p 0.05). Only for the organoleptic assessment of halitosis was a statistically significantly higher reduction found after consumption of a high-fiber meal compared to the control meal (p 0.05). In conclusion, the consumption of the meals in this study resulted in an at least 2.5-hour reduction of oral halitosis. The chewing-intensive (high-fiber) meal even resulted in a slightly higher reduction of oral halitosis in terms of organoleptic assessment (p 0.05)."
13_h,health_belief,18388413,Does diet cause bad breathe?,diet causes bad breathe,1.0,"Many food products are claimed to be effective in controlling halitosis. Halitosis is caused mainly by volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) such as H(2)S and CH(3)SH produced in the oral cavity. Oral microorganisms degrade proteinaceous substrates to cysteine and methionine, which are then converted to VSCs. Most treatments for halitosis focus on controlling the number of microorganisms in the oral cavity. Since tea polyphenols have been shown to have antimicrobial and deodorant effects, we have investigated whether green tea powder reduces VSCs in mouth air, and compared its effectiveness with that of other foods which are claimed to control halitosis. Immediately after administering the products, green tea showed the largest reduction in concentration of both H(2)S and CH(3)SH gases, especially CH(3)SH which also demonstrated a better correlation with odor strength than H(2)S; however, no reduction was observed at 1, 2 and 3 h after administration. Chewing gum, mints and parsley-seed oil product did not reduce the concentration of VSCs in mouth air at any time. Toothpaste, mints and green tea strongly inhibited VSCs production in a saliva-putrefaction system, but chewing gum and parsley-seed oil product could not inhibit saliva putrefaction. Toothpaste and green tea also demonstrated strong deodorant activities in vitro, but no significant deodorant activity of mints, chewing gum or parsley-seed oil product were observed. We concluded that green tea was very effective in reducing oral malodor temporarily because of its disinfectant and deodorant activities, whereas other foods were not effective."

These bacteria proteolyse the amino acids releasing volatile sulphur compounds. The management of halitosis involves determining and eliminating the causes, which includes identifying any contributory factors, because certain medical conditions are also associated with characteristic smells. Professional advice should be given on oral hygiene and diet, and treatments should include dental scaling, and root planing of the associated periodontal pockets to reduce the bacterial loading.

Extraoral sources of halitosis are responsible for 10-20% of all cases and are caused by poor diet, alcohol abuse, tobacco smoking, certain drugs and diseases of other parts of digestive tract as well as some systemic conditions. Diagnostics of halitosis includes subjective methods (examiner's sense of smell) and objective methods (instrumental analysis).

Therefore, it is important to study deodorization techniques for garlic breath. The volatiles responsible for garlic breath include diallyl disulfide, allyl mercaptan, allyl methyl disulfide, and allyl methyl sulfide. After eating garlic, water (control), raw, juiced or heated apple, raw or heated lettuce, raw or juiced mint leaves, or green tea were consumed immediately. The levels of the garlic volatiles on the breath were analyzed from 1 to 60 min by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). Garlic was also blended with water (control), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), rosemarinic acid, quercetin or catechin, and the volatiles in the headspace analyzed from 3 to 40 min by SIFT-MS. Raw apple, raw lettuce, and mint leaves significantly decreased all of the garlic breath volatiles in vivo. The proposed mechanism is enzymatic deodorization where volatiles react with phenolic compounds. Apple juice and mint juice also had a deodorizing effect on most of the garlic volatiles but were generally not as effective as the raw food, probably because the juice had enzymatic activity but the phenolic compounds had already polymerized. Both heated apple and heated lettuce produced a significant reduction of diallyl disulfide and allyl mercaptan. The presence of phenolic compounds that react with the volatile compounds even in the absence of enzymes is the most likely mechanism. Green tea had no deodorizing effect on the garlic volatile compounds. Rosmarinic acid, catechin, quercetin, and PPO significantly decreased all garlic breath volatiles in vitro.

Consequently, those practicing the healing arts have used olfaction to aid in their diagnosis of disease since the dawn of medical practice. Studies using modern instrumental analyses have focused upon analysis of breath volatiles for biomarkers of internal diseases.

While the risk of these conditions is thought to be greatest during the third trimester of pregnancy, the determinants of fetoplacental susceptibility to infection, the contribution of gestational age, and the in vivo progression of disease at the maternal-fetal interface are poorly understood. We developed a nonhuman primate model of listeriosis to better understand antecedents of adverse pregnancy outcomes in early pregnancy. Four pregnant cynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ) received a single intragastric inoculation between days 36 and 46 of gestation with 10<sup>7</sup> CFU of an L. monocytogenes strain isolated from a previous cluster of human listeriosis cases that resulted in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Fecal shedding, maternal bacteremia, and fetal demise were consistently noted within 7 to 13 days. Biopsy specimens of maternal liver, spleen, and lymph node displayed variable inflammation and relatively low bacterial burden. In comparison, we observed greater bacterial burden in the decidua and placenta and the highest burden in fetal tissues. Histopathology indicated vasculitis, fibrinoid necrosis, and thrombosis of the decidual spiral arteries, acute chorioamnionitis and villitis in the placenta, and hematogenous infection of the fetus. Vascular pathology suggests early impact of L. monocytogenes infection on spiral arteries in the decidua, which we hypothesize precipitates subsequent placentitis and fetal demise. These results demonstrate that L. monocytogenes tropism for the maternal reproductive tract results in infection of the decidua, placenta, and the fetus itself during the first trimester of pregnancy. IMPORTANCE Although listeriosis is known to cause significant fetal morbidity and mortality, it is typically recognized in the third trimester of human pregnancy. Its impact on early pregnancy is poorly defined. Here we provide evidence that exposure to L. monocytogenes in the first trimester poses a greater risk of fetal loss than currently appreciated. Similarities in human and nonhuman primate placentation, physiology, and reproductive immunology make this work highly relevant to human pregnancy. We highlight the concept that the maternal immune response that protects the mother from serious disease is unable to protect the fetus, a concept relevant to classic TORCH (<underline>t</underline>oxoplasmosis, <underline>o</underline>ther, <underline>r</underline>ubella, <underline>c</underline>ytomegalovirus, and <underline>h</underline>erpes) infections and newly illuminated by current Zika virus outbreaks.

That what is significant, listeria penetrates through the placenta and can lead to the fatal infection, which is characteristic by disseminated granulomatosis lesions of a newborn and micro abscess on the placenta. In a newborn can provoke the sepsis with the mortality of 50%. By the examination are encircled two groups of the reproductive age-totally 60. From these 30 had one or more spontaneous abortion, and 30 had no spontaneous abortion. By the serologic reaction the agglutination is discovered the presence of the antibodies in serum of the. The positive serologic answer was found in the first group in 18 (60%) and in that another group in 8 participants (26, 70%)."
14_h,health_belief,30675327,Does listeria cause miscarriage?,listeria causes miscarriage,1.0,"Background and objectives: Listeria monocytogenes is the etiological agent of listeriosis, a highly fatal infection which causes miscarriage or stillbirth in pregnant women. The objective of this study was to detect the prevalence, serotypes, antimicrobial susceptibility and virulence factors of L. monocytogenes isolated from pregnant women with vaginitis at a tertiary care hospital in Tehran, Iran. Materials and methods: During September 2015 to February 2017, a total of 400 vaginal swabs were collected from pregnant women. The presumptive isolates were characterized biochemically. All L. monocytogenes isolates were further analyzed by serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility tests. All positive samples for L. monocytogenes were analyzed for presence of virulence genes ( hly A, act A, inl A, inl C, inl J and prf A). Results: Twenty-two (5.5%) of the samples were found positive for presence of L. monocytogenes. Most isolates are resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (81.82%) and chloramphenicol (54.55%). The majority of tested isolates (59.10%) belonged to serotype 4b, followed by 1/2a (22.73%), 1/2b (13.63%), and 3c (4.54%). The hly A, act A and inl A were detected in all of the 22 L. monocytogenes isolates, but two, three and five isolates were found to lack inl C, inl J and prf A, respectively. Only one isolate lacked three inl C, inl J and prf A genes, and two isolates simultaneously lacked both inl J and prf A genes. Conclusion: Evaluation of virulence factors and antimicrobial susceptibility can be highly helpful to develop effective treatment strategies against L. monocytogenes infections. This study is noteworthy in that it documents prevalence, virulence characteristics, and antimicrobial resistance of L. monocytogenes ."
14_h,health_belief,21884294,Does listeria cause miscarriage?,listeria causes miscarriage,1.0,"This review considers the role of intracellular bacteria in adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as miscarriage, stillbirths, and preterm labour. The cause of miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm labour often remains unexplained. Intracellular bacteria that grow either poorly or not at all on media used routinely to detect human pathogens could be the aetiological agents of these obstetric conditions. For example, Listeria monocytogenes and Coxiella burnetti are intracellular bacteria that have a predilection for the fetomaternal unit and may induce fatal disease in the mother and/or fetus. Both are important foodborne or zoonotic pathogens in pregnancy. Preventive measures, diagnostic tools and treatment will be reviewed. Moreover, we will also address the importance in adverse pregnancy outcomes of other intracellular bacteria, including Brucella abortus and various members of the order Chlamydiales. Indeed, there is growing evidence that Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia abortus and Chlamydia pneumoniae infections may also result in adverse pregnancy outcomes in humans and/or animals. Moreover, newly discovered Chlamydia-like organisms have recently emerged as new pathogens of both animals and humans. For example, Waddlia chondrophila, a Chlamydia-related bacterium isolated from aborted bovine fetuses, has also been implicated in human miscarriages. Future research should help us to better understand the pathophysiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes caused by intracellular bacteria and to determine the precise mode of transmission of newly identified bacteria, such as Waddlia and Parachlamydia. These emerging pathogens may represent the tip of the iceberg of a large number of as yet unknown intracellular pathogenic agents."

The most affected age group proved to be that in the range of 20-30 yrs: 378 (75%) cases. 107 (21.23%) female patients had the diagnostic titer (&gt; or = 1/320): among these, 38 (7.53%) had miscarriages in the IVth-VIIIth month and 18 (3.57%) gave birth to dead foetuses; during pregnancy, 10 (1.98%) female patients received treatment with Ampicillin and 2 (0.39%) treatment with Erythromycin. In the age group &gt; 31 yrs, the 1/320 titer was noticed in 21 (4.16%) female patients but among these only 4 (0.79%) had a history of miscarriage in the final pregnancy months; they were administered Ampicillin during pregnancy. Although there is no clear-cut evidence, our results point to the conclusion that these female patients were contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes."
14_h,health_belief,29720597,Does listeria cause miscarriage?,listeria causes miscarriage,1.0,"Listeria monocytogenes is a mammalian pathogen that causes gastroenteritis, miscarriages and infections of the central nervous system in immunocompromised individuals. Its main virulence factor is listeriolysin O (LLO), a pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC), which enables bacterial escape from the phagolysosome and contributes to bacterial pathogenicity. Details of cholesterol (Chol) recognition and membrane binding mechanisms by LLO are still not known. Here we used <sup>19</sup>F-NMR spectroscopy in order to assess LLO-Chol interactions in solution and in a Chol-rich membrane environment. LLO has six tryptophan residues located in the region of the molecule that is first in contact with lipid membranes. <sup>19</sup>F-LLO, which contained 5-fluoro-tryptophans, was prepared by using isotopic labelling in an E. coli expression system. Signals in the <sup>19</sup>F-NMR spectrum of <sup>19</sup>F-LLO were unambiguously assigned by using a series of single Trp → Phe point mutations. The results employing various cholesterol preparations in solution indicate that tryptophan residues are not directly involved in Chol binding in solution. However, significant chemical shift changes were observed upon LLO binding to Chol-rich membranes, highlighting the role of tryptophan residues in membrane interactions (W512) and oligomerisation (W189 and W489)."
14_h,health_belief,19542009,Does listeria cause miscarriage?,listeria causes miscarriage,1.0,"Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous bacterium that causes significant foodborne disease with high mortality rates in immunocompromised adults. In pregnant women foodborne infection can give rise to infection of the fetus resulting in miscarriage. In addition, the bacterium has recently been demonstrated to cause localized gastrointestinal symptoms, predominantly in immunocompetent individuals. The murine model of systemic L. monocytogenes infection has provided numerous insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis of this organism. However, recent application of transcriptomic and proteomic approaches as well as the development of new model systems has allowed a focus upon factors that influence adaptation to gastrointestinal environments and adhesion to and invasion of the gastrointestinal mucosa. In addition, the availability of a large number of complete L. monocytogenes genome sequences has permitted inter-strain comparisons and the identification of factors that may influence the emergence of 'epidemic' phenotypes. Here we review some of the exciting recent developments in the analysis of the interaction between L. monocytogenes and the host gastrointestinal tract."

Invasive disease can follow bacteremia causing meningoencephalitis, endocarditis and spontaneous miscarriages in immunocompromised patients and pregnant women respectively. We present the first case in England of endogenous endophthalmitis caused by L. monocytogenes following acute gastroenteritis in an immunocompetent host. A 50-year-old South Asian female presented with acute painful unilateral visual loss occurring shortly after an episode of self-limiting gastroenteritis. On examination, the eye was very inflamed with a hypopyon uveitis. A vitreous biopsy confirmed growth of L.monocytogenes serotype 1/2a. Diagnostic delay commonly occurs in endogenous endophthalmitis and exacerbates an already poor visual prognosis. Listeria spp. must be considered in ocular inflammation following gastroenteritis. The intraocular inflammation subsided but surgical intervention was required to remove vitreous debris and improve visual acuity."
