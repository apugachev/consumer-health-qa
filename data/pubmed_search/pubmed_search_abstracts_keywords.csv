1,2019,35285701,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Aim: Cranberries ( Vaccinium macrocarpon ) are traditionally used in prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The authors' aim was to evaluate effects of a supplement containing cranberry extract, pumpkin seed extract, vitamin C, and vitamin B 2 on recurrent uncomplicated UTIs in women and their intestinal microbiota. Methods: A prospective, uncontrolled exploratory study was conducted in women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs. The primary exploratory outcome was the number of UTIs in a 6-month prospective observation period compared with a 6-month retrospective period. Further outcomes included number of antibiotics, quality of life (SF-36), intestinal microbiota (assessed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing), and evaluation questions. Parameters were assessed at baseline and after 1, 2, and 7 months (start of intake of cranberry supplement after 1 month for 6 months). p -Values were calculated with the pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank test for α diversity and permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Results: Twenty-three women (aged 52.7 ± 12.4 years) were included in the study. Participants reported 2.2 ± 0.8 UTIs (at baseline) in the previous 6 months. After 6 months of cranberry intake, participants reported a significant decrease to 0.5 ± 0.9 UTIs ( p 0.001). Number of antibiotic therapies was also significantly ( p 0.001) reduced by 68% during 6 months of cranberry intake (0.14 ± 0.35) when compared with 6 months retrospectively (1.14 ± 0.71). The SF-36 physical component score increased from 44.9 ± 5.5 at baseline to 45.7 ± 4.6 at 7 months ( p = 0.16). The SF-36 mental component score decreased slightly from the baseline value of 46.5 ± 6.5 to 46.2 ± 6.4 at 7 months ( p = 0.74). No significant intragroup mean changes at genus, family, or species level for α and β diversity within the intestinal microbiota were found. In the evaluation questions, participants rated the cranberry extract positively and considered it beneficial. The supplement intake was safe. Conclusions: This study shows that women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs benefit from cranberry intake. Future larger clinical studies with further investigation of the mechanisms of action are required to determine the effects of cranberries on participants with uncomplicated UTIs."
1,2019,34205292,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Consumption of cranberries is associated with the putative effects of preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs). Cranberry proanthocyanidins (PAC) contain unusual double A-type linkages, which are associated with strong interactions with surface virulence factors found on UTI-causing bacteria such as extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC), depicting in bacterial agglutination processes. In this work, we demonstrated the efficacy of cranberry PAC (200 μg/mL) to agglutinate ExPEC (5.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) in vitro as a selective interaction for the design of functionalized biosensors for potential detection of UTIs. We fabricated functionalized screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) by modifying with PAC-polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposites and tested the effectiveness of the PAC-PANI/SPE biosensor for detecting the presence of ExPEC in aqueous suspensions. Results indicated that the PAC-PANI/SPE was highly sensitive (limit of quantification of 1 CFU/mL of ExPEC), and its response was linear over the concentration range of 1-70,000 CFU/mL, suggesting cranberry PAC-functionalized biosensors are an innovative alternative for the detection and diagnosis of ExPEC-associated UTIs. The biosensor was also highly selective, reproducible, and stable."
1,2019,32211986,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Background: This study evaluated the definition, the prevalence of use and the governmental regulations of phytotherapy and four examples of herbal medicine are discussed in more detail. Results: This research group evaluated 4 topics: St. John's wort for treating (mild to moderate) depression, tomato extract as a platelet inhibitor, Rhodiola against stress-related fatigue and cranberries for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Conclusion: The findings were diverse and must be individually taken into account. Evidence for efficacy varies within and between the four examples. An explanation for the lack of reproducibility of findings from preclinical and clinical experiments might be the insufficient standardization of herbal medicines. There is no scientific reason why phytotherapy should not be investigated with the same rigor as conventional drugs to establish the efficacy and potential risks. Meanwhile, it is concluded that care is essential when using herbal medicine in the daily routine and informing patients about potential shortcomings and dangers of herbal medicines should be considered a duty of pharmacists and physicians."
1,2019,31714906,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"The opportunistic pathogen Escherichia coli, a common member of the human gut microbiota belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, is the causative agent of the majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The gut microbiota serves as a reservoir for uropathogenic E. coli where they are shed in feces, colonize the periurethral area, and infect the urinary tract. Currently, front line treatment for UTIs consists of oral antibiotics, but the rise of antibiotic resistance is leading to higher rates of recurrence, and antibiotics cause collateral damage to other members of the gut microbiota. It is commonly believed that incorporation of the American cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, into the diet is useful for reducing recurrence of UTIs. We hypothesized such a benefit might be explained by a prebiotic or antimicrobial effect on the gut microbiota. As such, we tested cranberry extracts and whole cranberry powder on a human gut microbiome-derived community in a gut simulator and found that cranberry components broadly modulate the microbiota by reducing the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and increasing the abundance of Bacteroidaceae. To identify the specific compounds responsible for this, we tested a panel of compounds isolated from cranberries for activity against E. coli, and found that salicylate exhibited antimicrobial activity against both laboratory E. coli and human UTI E. coli isolates. In a gut simulator, salicylate reduced levels of Enterobacteriaceae and elevated Bacteroidaceae in a dose dependent manner."
1,2019,31140512,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) present many complications that potentially could be linked to increased cardiovascular mortality such as inflammation, oxidative stress, cellular senescence and gut dysbiosis. There is growing evidence suggesting that nutritional strategies may reduce some of these complications. Clinical studies suggest that supplementation of cranberries may have beneficial effects on human health such as prevention of urinary tract infections. More recently, the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects as well as modulation of gut microbiota provided by cranberry phytochemicals have drawn more attention. A better understanding of possible effects and mechanisms of action of cranberry supplementation in humans could inform researchers about warranted future directions for clinical studies targeting these complications in CKD patients by applying nutritional strategies involving cranberry supplementation."
1,2019,30746933,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Findings concerning the antiadhesive activity of cranberry phenolic compounds and their microbial-derived metabolites against Gram-negative ( Escherichia coli ATCC 53503 and DSM 10791) and Gram-positive ( Enterococcus faecalis 04-1) bacteria in T24 cells are reported. A-Type procyanidins (A2 and cinnamtannin B-1) exhibited antiadhesive activity (at concentrations ≥250 μM), a feature that was not observed for B-type procyanidins (B2). The metabolites hippuric acid and α-hydroxyhippuric acid also showed effective results at concentrations ≥250 μM. With regard to conjugated metabolites, sulfation seemed to increase the antiadhesive activity of cranberry-derived metabolites as 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid 3- O-sulfate presented active results, unlike its corresponding nonsulfated form. In contrast, methylation decreased antiadhesive activity as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was found to be active but not its corresponding methylated form (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid). As a whole, this work sustains the antiadhesive activity of cranberry-derived metabolites as one of the mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of cranberries against urinary tract infections."
1,2019,30520372,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent a common and costly public health issue. The bacterium Escherichia coli is mainly responsible for most uncomplicated UTIs. Cranberry antibacterial effects have extensively been studied in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of action of its bioactive components and their clinical benefits against UTIs. In this respect, the present review aims to critically analyze the current clinical studies that have evaluated the efficacy of supplementing cranberry products against UTIs in different subpopulations. Methods: PubMed database was comprehensively searched, using relative keywords in order to identify clinical trials exploring the efficacy of cranberry supplementation against UTIs. Results: Current clinical evidence clearly indicates a possible benefit overall from the use of cranberries against UTIs. Cranberry consumption may prevent bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells, reducing UTI related symptoms. Cranberry consumption could also decrease UTI related symptoms by suppressing inflammatory cascades as an immunologic response to bacterial invasion. The existing clinical trials have supported substantial evidence that the beneficial effects of cranberry against UTIs seem to be prophylactic by preventing infections recurrence; however, they exert low effectiveness in populations at increased risk for contracting UTIs. Moreover, a lack of cost-effectiveness for cranberry supplementation has been highlighted. Conclusions: Additional well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials that use standardized cranberry products for long study periods are strongly recommended in order to determine the efficiency of cranberry on the prevention of UTIs in susceptible populations. At present, cranberry supplementation can safely be suggested as complementary therapy in women with recurrent UTIs."
1,2019,28288837,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Purpose: We sought to clarify the association between cranberry intake and the prevention of urinary tract infections. Materials and methods: This systematic review, which complies with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) statement, was done as a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of clinical trials. Results: The findings clearly showed the potential use of cranberries for the clinical condition of urinary tract infection. Cranberry products significantly reduced the incidence of urinary tract infections as indicated by the weighted risk ratio (0.6750, 95% CI 0.5516-0.7965, p 0.0001). The results of subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients at some risk for urinary tract infections were more susceptible to the effects of cranberry ingestion. Conclusions: The results of the current study could be used by physicians to recommend cranberry ingestion to decrease the incidence of urinary tract infections, particularly in individuals with recurrent urinary tract infections. This would also reduce the administration of antibiotics, which could be beneficial since antibiotics can lead to the worldwide emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms."
1,2019,28186383,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Objective: To evaluate whether cranberries are able to prevent postoperative urinary bacteriuria in patients undergoing pelvic surgery and receiving transurethral catheterisation. Design: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Settings: French tertiary Care centre, University Hospital. Population: A total of 272 women undergoing pelvic surgery aged 18 or older. Methods: Participants undergoing pelvic surgery were randomised to 36 mg cranberry (proanthocyanidins, PAC) or placebo once daily for 10 days. Statistical analysis was performed by a chi-square test. Main outcome measures: The primary and secondary outcomes were postoperative bacteriuria, defined by a positive urine culture, within the first 15 and 40 days, respectively. Results: Two hundred and fifty-five participants received the intended treatment: 132 (51.8%) received PAC and 123 (48.2%) received placebo. There were no significant differences in baseline demographics, intra-operative characteristics or duration and type of catheterisation between the two groups. PAC prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of bacteriuria treatment within 15 days of surgery [27% bacteriuria with PAC compared with 25% bacteriuria with placebo: relative risk 1.05, 95% CI 0.78-1.4, P = 0.763). The same result was observed on day 40. Bacteriuria occurred more often in older women with increased length of catheterisation. Conclusion: Immediate postoperative prophylaxis with PAC does not reduce the risk of postoperative bacteriuria in patients receiving short-term transurethral catheterisation after pelvic surgery. Tweetable abstract: PAC prophylaxis does not reduce the risk of postoperative bacteriuria in patients undergoing pelvic surgery."
1,2019,27866177,Can cranberries prevent urinary tract infections?,cranberries urinary tract infections,0.0,"Background • Highly concentrated cranberry juice has long been considered to have protective properties against urinary tract infections (UTIs), on the basis of its content of cranberry proanthocyanidins, with A-type interflavan bonds. Objective • This study intended to evaluate the benefits of a highly concentrated cranberry juice for the prevention of repeated episodes of UTI in uncircumcised boys. Design • The study was a randomized, controlled trial. Setting • The study took place at Taipei City Hospital, Renai and Zhongxing Branches (Taipei City, Taiwan). Participants • Participants were 55 uncircumcised boys and 12 circumcised boys, aged 6 to 18 y, with histories of uncomplicated UTI, who were patients at the hospital. Intervention • The uncircumcised boys were randomly divided into 2 groups: (1) group 1 (n = 28) took 4 oz (120 mL) daily of cranberry juice for 6 mo; and (2) group 2 (n = 27), the negative control group, drank a placebo juice for 6 months. The circumcised boys in group 3, a positive control group, also drank a placebo juice for 6 mo. Outcome Measures • The time to UTI (ie, to the appearance of symptoms plus pyuria) was the main outcome. Asymptomatic bacteriuria, adherence to the treatment, and adverse effects were assessed at monthly visits. Results • After 6 mo of a prophylactic treatment with cranberry juice, the incidence of bacteriuria, mainly Escherichia coli, as shown in urine cultures at ≥1 × 105, were 25% (7/28), 37% (10/27), and 33.3% (4/12) in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The comparisons of the rate of prevention of a recurrence of UTI between group 1 and group 2 and between group 1 and group 3 showed that group 1 had fewer recurrent episodes of UTI. No children withdrew from the study. No adverse events or side effects were recorded. Conclusions • Cranberry juice may reduce the number of repeated episodes of UTI in uncircumcised boys and may have beneficial effects against the growth of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Its preventive benefits against UTI in the uncircumcised boys were even higher than those of circumcision for the circumcised boys."
3,2019,34937487,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"Introduction: As an emerging neuromodulation therapy, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has been proven to be safe and effective for epilepsy, major depressive disorders, insomnia, glucose metabolic disorders, pain, stroke, post stroke rehabilitation, anxiety, fear, cognitive impairment, cardiovascular disorders, tinnitus, Prader-Willi Syndrome, and COVID-19. Areas covered: Although the history of taVNS is only two decades, the devices carrying taVNS technique have been constantly updated. Especially in recent years, the development of taVNS devices has presented a new trend. To conclude, the development of taVNS devices has entered a new era, thus the update speed and quality of taVNS devices will be considerably improved in the future. This article reviewed the history and classification of taVNS devices. Expert opinion: The correlation between the effectiveness and stimulation parameters from taVNS devices still remains unclear. There is a lack of standard or harmonization among different taVNS devices. Strategies, including further comparative research and establishment of standard, have been recommended in this article to promote the future development of taVNS devices."
3,2019,34500261,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"First clinical observations of the therapeutic effect of vagus nerve stimulation were of patients who were treated for refractory epilepsy with a fully implanted vagus nerve stimulator, who also reported an improvement of their migraine and cluster headache. With the development of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation, first clinical studies concerning a possible therapeutic effect in migraine and cluster headache were performed. In a controlled study, transcutaneous cervical vagus nerve stimulation (tcVNS) showed a significant but limited effect in acute treatment of a migraine attack. There was no significant prophylactic effect in episodic migraine. Concerning cluster headache, there was a clear beneficial effect in the prophylaxis of chronic cluster headache and in the attack treatment in episodic cluster headache. There are fewer studies in the literature on the effect of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), with a partial overlap with studies on electrical ear acupuncture. In a small controlled clinical trial, there was a significant effect of taVNS in the prevention of chronic migraine. In less defined clinical studies, there were some positive signs that the method may be beneficial in chronic back pain and in unspecific gastro-intestinal pain in adolescents. Based on the available evidence, it is probable that vagus nerve stimulation can have a clinically meaningful influence on pain syndromes, but there are still several questions (e.g. frequency of the stimulation; duration of the stimulation; differential effects of auricular vagus stimulation and cervical vagus stimulation) to answer before vagus stimulation can be used widely in the clinic."
3,2019,34311182,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"Objective: To assess seizure frequency and quality of life (QOL) in a group of adults with temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS) before and after 10 weeks of systemic acupuncture sessions and compare the results with a group of patients with TLE-HS not undergoing acupuncture. Methods: The Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31) and the initial and final seizure frequency of 26 adult patients with TLE-HS who underwent acupuncture sessions for 10 consecutive weeks were assessed. The data were compared to those of 26 patients with TLE-HS not submitted to acupuncture, with p 0.05. Results: There was a clinically significant effect in reducing the mean number of seizures per month in the follow-up period of patients submitted or not to acupuncture (no intervention group and intervention group, effect size: -0.94 and -1.01, respectively). In the last four weeks of follow-up, there was a significant difference between the no intervention and intervention groups (0.5 [0-2] and 0 [0-4]; p = 0.018). When using minimally important change (MIC) threshold data for the QOLIE-31 between the final and initial scores, with the Cantril Ladder Scale as anchoring, it was observed that, in the intervention group, large clinically significant effects were seen for all dimensions, except for cognitive function, medication effect, and social function, which presented medium effects. In the follow-up, the variation of the QOLIE-31 scores was positive for both groups; however, it was higher in all dimensions in the intervention group, indicating a better QOL. Conclusion: There was a reduction in the mean number of seizures per month in all patients during the follow-up period. Acupuncture significantly reduced the number of seizures in the intervention group in the final phase of the study. QOL improvements occurred in all patients, however, more significantly in the intervention group."
3,2019,33893986,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"Objective: To evaluate the safety of thread embedding acupuncture therapy (TEAT) and discuss the prevention and treatment of some adverse events (AEs). Methods: Review of databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), CBMdisc, Wanfang, VIP databases and English literature published in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science, were searched from their inception to January 2020, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case reports in which AEs with TEAT were included. Cochrane Collaboration's tool and RevMan V.5.3.3 software were used to evaluate the quality of the studies. Results: A total of 61 studies (45 RCTs and 16 case reports) with 620 cases of AEs were included in this review. These studies were published in two countries: China and South Korea. Twenty eight kinds of AEs were summarized. The most common AEs were induration, bleeding and ecchymosis, redness and swelling, fever, and pain. They were accounted for 75.35% (425/564) in the review, and most of them were mild. The rarest AEs were epilepsy, irregular menstruation, skin ulcer, thread malabsorption, and fat liquefaction, with 1 case each. But not all of them had clear causal relationship with TEAT. Most of the AEs were local reactions [with incidence of 9.83% (480/4,882)] and systemic reactions accounted for only 1.27% (62/4,882). Although the included studies showed that AEs were very commonly encountered (11.09%), only 5 cases of severe AEs reported from 2013 to 2017 (0.1%) by using catgut thread, which are rarely seen nowdays with the wide use of new absorbable surgical suture. All of the severe AEs were recovered after symptomatic treatment with no sequelae. Conclusions: The evidence showed that TEAT is a relatively safe and convenient therapy especially since application of new absorbable surgical suture. Improving practitioner skills, regulating operations, and paying attention to the patients' conditions may reduce the incidence of AEs and improve safety of TEAT."
3,2019,33541336,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"Background: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and its impact on antiepileptic drug (AED) adherence among patients with epilepsy. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 100 epilepsy patients, aged 18 years or older that did not have any physical or psychiatric illness. A patient-administered questionnaire was used to assess their knowledge, attitude towards, practice, and perceived effectiveness (KAPP) of CAM. Established adherence assessment tools were used to determine patient medication adherence. Results: The prevalence of CAM usage was found to be at 58%. CAM was used more frequently by males (n = 32, 60.4%) than by females (n = 26, 55.3%; p = 0.609). The most commonly used CAM included vitamins and minerals (36%), ginseng (16%), antioxidants (15%), and acupuncture (12%). A significant number of patients had low knowledge of (59%) and a positive attitude (54%) toward complementary and alternative medicine. Main reasons for using CAM were a lower price, better availability, and inadequate seizure control by AEDs. About 43% of the patients who used CAM informed their doctor. Prevalence of non-adherence to AED therapy was found to be 68%. A significant association was found between non-adherence and CAM usage (p 0.01). Conclusion: A high prevalence of CAM usage and non-adherence to AEDs among epilepsy patients was identified. CAM usage was associated with a non-adherence to AED therapy. This study highlights the need to explore CAM usage with patients before making clinical decisions to achieve the best outcomes from AED therapy."
3,2019,33530188,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"Background: Infantile cerebral palsy refers to brain damage in infants and young children during their development, causing brain dysfunction, mainly manifested as dyskinesia, which may be complicated by mental retardation, epilepsy, and bone and joint developmental disorders. Clinical practice shows that acupuncture can effectively treat children with cerebral palsy, but it needs to be proven. This research will systematically evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of acupuncture and moxibustion in the treatment of children with cerebral palsy, and provide evidence-based evidence for it. Method: Search the following databases, including CNKI, WANFANG, China Biomedical Database, VIP, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science. The retrieval time is from the establishment of the databases to October 2020, collecting all clinical randomized controlled studies of acupuncture and moxibustion treatment of children with cerebral palsy. Two investigators independently extract and evaluate the data of the included studies, and use RevMan V.5.3 software to conduct meta-analysis of the included literature. Result: This study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture and moxibustion in the treatment of children with cerebral palsy through indicators such as Gross Motor Function Measure Scale, the Modified Ashworth Scale, and so on. Conclusion: This study will provide reliable evidence-based evidence for the clinical application of acupuncture and moxibustion in the treatment of children with cerebral palsy. Ethics and dissemination: Private information from individuals will not be published. This systematic review also does not involve endangering participant rights. Ethical approval was not required. The results may be published in a peer-reviewed journal or disseminated at relevant conferences. Osf registration number: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/7GUF5."
3,2019,33380304,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"Background: There is a complex and interactive relationship between sleep and epilepsy. Sleep disorders are common in patients with epilepsy, and methods for managing sleep disorders in patients with epilepsy are limited. Objective: This review addresses the relationship among sleep, sleep disorders, and epilepsy, focusing on the management of sleep disorders in epilepsy, including some complementary and alternative therapies. Methods: The terms related to ""sleep"" and ""epilepsy"" were searched in ""Pubmed"" and ""Cochrane Library"". Results: Sleep stages differently affect both seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges. Seizures disrupt sleep architecture greatly, especially when occurring during sleep in the night. Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are the most frequent types of comorbid sleep disorders in patients with epilepsy. Pharmacological agents with both anti-convulsant and sedative effects are the priorities for comorbid sleep disorders in epilepsy. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most effective non-pharmacological method to improve OSA and reduce seizures. Complementary and alternative therapies such as Chinese traditional medicine, cognitive behavioral therapy, meditation, yoga, neurofeedback, and acupuncture may have benefits in reducing seizures and improving sleep quality simultaneously by alleviating stress and seizure triggers; however, evidence- based therapies are still deficient. Conclusion: Management of sleep disorders in patients with epilepsy is challenging. Large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials are in demand to guide the treatments in the future."
3,2019,32759074,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"Objective: The aim of this pilot study was to examine the safety and tolerability of an eight-week treatment of twice weekly auricular acupuncture as a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). The secondary aim was to determine if auricular acupuncture was effective at reducing PNES event frequency. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are as common as multiple sclerosis and are highly resistant to intervention. Unfortunately, there is no standard of care therapy, although mental health treatment referrals are commonly made. Acupuncture is felt to be a safe and cost-effective treatment for many diseases and symptoms including mental health disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and conversion disorders. We propose to examine auricular acupuncture as a treatment for PNES. Methods: A single-center, 16-week trial of auricular acupuncture was designed: a four-week baseline period, followed by an eight-week active treatment period during which subjects received twice weekly auricular acupuncture, then followed by a four-week washout period. Tolerability was defined as completion of 12 of 16 treatments. Successful compliance with seizure diary was defined as &gt;80%, or 100 of 120 days completed. Safety profile was established and seizure count per week was also calculated. Results: A total of 29 subjects enrolled from a consecutive sample of 73 PNES diagnoses discharging from our epilepsy unit. Twenty-two subjects entered the study with 91% completing more than 12 of 16 treatments, 91% meeting the endpoint of completing &gt;80% of diary entries. Adverse events were mild, and only two subjects were withdrawn due to increased PNES frequency. Although short-term in design, using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), we observed a statistically significant reduction in seizure count from baseline at treatment month one, treatment month two, and at the washout period (p = 0.0083). Eleven of 12 subjects (52.3%) who received at least one treatment recorded a 50% frequency reduction. Three of 21 subjects (14%) were PNES-free at the end of the study. Significance: Auricular acupuncture is well-tolerated in a population with PNES and exhibits similar event frequency reductions as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We believe that this is the first literature report examining auricular acupuncture for the treatment of PNES."

3,2019,32630156,Can acupuncture be effective for people with epilepsy?,acupuncture epilepsy,0.0,"Acupuncture is clinically used to treat various diseases and exerts positive local and systemic effects in several nervous system diseases. Advanced molecular and clinical studies have continually attempted to decipher the mechanisms underlying these effects of acupuncture. While a growing understanding of the pathophysiology underlying several nervous system diseases shows it to be related to inflammation and impair cell regeneration after ischemic events, the relationship between the therapeutic mechanism of acupuncture and the p38 MAPK signal pathway has yet to be elucidated. This review discusses the latest advancements in the identification of the effect of acupuncture on the p38 signaling pathway in several nervous system diseases. We electronically searched databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from their inception to April 2020, using the following keywords alone or in various combinations: ""acupuncture"", ""p38 MAPK pathway"", ""signaling"", ""stress response"", ""inflammation"", ""immune"", ""pain"", ""analgesic"", ""cerebral ischemic injury"", ""epilepsy"", ""Alzheimer's disease"", ""Parkinson's disease"", ""dementia"", ""degenerative"", and ""homeostasis"". Manual acupuncture and electroacupuncture confer positive therapeutic effects by regulating proinflammatory cytokines, ion channels, scaffold proteins, and transcription factors including TRPV1/4, Na v , BDNF, and NADMR1; consequently, p38 regulates various phenomena including cell communication, remodeling, regeneration, and gene expression. In this review article, we found the most common acupoints for the relief of nervous system disorders including GV20, GV14, ST36, ST37, and LI4. Acupuncture exhibits dual regulatory functions of activating or inhibiting different p38 MAPK pathways, contributing to an overall improvement of clinical symptoms and function in several nervous system diseases."

It is found that the most of acupoints of high use frequency are overlapped between such two kinds of literature. By integrating and classifying the same or similar contents of acupuncture prescription articles between headache and migraine, the common characteristics and acupoint selections are extracted, the regularity of acupoint selection is explored in view of etiology, complication and affected location, and the attributed fourteen meridians are analyzed statistically in terms of the acupoints in the earliest recorded prescriptions.

5,2019,35854329,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,"Background: Migraine is a highly prevalent neurological disorder. It is the third most prevalent disorder and the seventh highest cause of disability worldwide. Acupuncture may be a viable prophylactic treatment option for frequent or uncontrolled migraine. Clinical studies comparing acupuncture and placebo acupuncture have not reached a consistent conclusion in confirming whether acupuncture is effective in migraine prophylaxis. The effect of acupuncture mainly depends on acupoints and needles operation. We found that the design of the placebo acupuncture in previous studies included shallow needling at sham acupoints, non-penetrating needling at sham acupoints, and needling at inactive acupuncture points to achieve the inert effect of control group, but the non-penetrating needling at true acupoints was ignored. This randomized controlled trial aims to use true acupoints for non-penetrating acupuncture as control to evaluate the efficacy of manual acupuncture for the prophylaxis of migraine without aura (MWoA). Methods/design: This is a single-blinded, randomized, controlled, prospective, multi-center trial with two parallel treatment groups. A total of 198 eligible patients with MWoA will be randomly divided into two groups (1:1 allocation ratio). The intervention group will receive manual acupuncture and the control group will receive placebo acupuncture (non-penetrating). Patients will receive three acupuncture treatment sessions per week for 4 consecutive weeks. All patients will then receive a 12-week follow-up. Discussion: In this study, we are evaluating the efficacy and safety of manual acupuncture in the prophylaxis of MWoA. The placebo control is using non-penetrating needling verum acupoints. It is essential to determine an appropriate control method to ensure the methodological quality of a randomized controlled trial. Trial registration: The trial has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (approval no. ChiCTR2000032308 ) in April 2020."

Professor WU proposes that occiput-nape dysfunction, meridians-tendons dysfunction and stagnation of collaterals due to obstruction of excess-evil could lead to migraine. As such, migraine is treated by comprehensive treatment of adjusting occiput-nape functional zone, relaxing meridians-tendons and blood-letting combined with fire acupuncture."
5,2019,35750456,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,"Introduction: Migraine is a common neurological disorder with a higher prevalence occurring in women. Migraine without aura (MwoA) is the most common type of migraine. In recent years, the safety and effectiveness of acupuncture for migraines have been internationally recognised. Contralateral acupuncture (CAT) (Jùcì) is an ancient classic acupuncture technique from Huang Di Nei Jing that refers to the acupoints on the right side (healthy side) selected for diseases on the left (affected side) and vice versa. Some studies have shown that efficacy of CAT on the painful disorder is even better than ipsilateral acupuncture (IAT), but there remains a lack of high-quality evidence to support it. Methods and analysis: This is a single-centre, randomised and sham-controlled clinical trial in China with three parallel groups that aim to evaluate the efficacy of CAT in women with unilateral MwoA. 243 participants will be randomly divided into the experimental group (CAT group), control group 1 (IAT group) and control group 2 (sham acupuncture group) (1:1:1 allocation ratio). Each group will be given 30-minute treatment sessions, once every other day, approximately three times per week, for a total of 24 treatments and follow-up visits two times. The primary outcome is the changes in days of migraine attacks. The secondary outcomes are frequency of migraine attacks, intensity of migraine, migraine duration, the dose of intake of acute medication, the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Migraine Disability Assessment Score, the Headache Impact Test-6 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The data will be collected at the baseline time (week 0), end of treatment (week 4-8) and the follow-up time (week 12-16). Adverse events will be collected and recorded during each treatment. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Sports Trauma Specialist Hospital of Yunnan Province (2021-01). All participants will provide written informed consent before randomisation. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences. Trial registration number: Chinese Clinical Trial Registration Center (ChiCTR2100051479)."
5,2019,35712941,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,"Objective: To observe the clinical effect of acupuncture at sphenopalatine ganglion combined with conventional acupuncture for episodic cluster headache (CH). Methods: One hundred and eighty patients with episodic CH were randomly divided into a combined group (60 cases, 3 cases dropped off)，an acupuncture group (60 cases, 2 cases dropped off) and a sphenopalatine ganglion group (60 cases, 2 cases dropped off and 1 case was removed). The patients in the acupuncture group were treated with conventional acupuncture at Touwei (ST 8), Yintang (GV 24<sup>+</sup>), Yangbai (GB 14), Hegu (LI 4), etc., once a day, 6 times a week. The patients in the sphenopalatine ganglion group were treated with acupuncture at sphenopalatine ganglion, once every other day, 3 times a week. On the basis of the conventional acupuncture, the combined group was treated with acupuncture at sphenopalatine ganglion once every other day. Two weeks were taken as a course of treatment, and 3 courses of treatment were required in the 3 groups. The score of visual analogue scale (VAS), the number of headache attacks per week, the duration of each headache attack and the score of migraine-specific quality of life questionnaire version 2.1 (MSQ) were observed before and after treatment and in follow-up of 3 months after treatment. The clinical efficacy of each group was compared. Results: After treatment and in follow-up, the VAS score of headache, the number of headache attacks per week, the duration of each headache attack, and each various scores and the total score of MSQ of each group were lower than those before treatment ( P 0.01). Except that the number of headache attacks per week in the combined group was lower than the sphenopalatine ganglion group ( P 0.01), other indexes in the combined group were lower than the other two groups ( P 0.05, P 0.01). The total effective rate in the combined group was 93.0% (53/57), which was higher than 75.9% (44/58) in the acupuncture group and 73.7% (42/57) in the sphenopalatine ganglion group（ P 0.05, P 0.01). Conclusion: Acupuncture at sphenopalatine ganglion combined with conventional acupuncture could reduce the degree of pain in patients with episodic CH, reduce the number and duration of headache attacks, and improve the quality of life of patients. It is more effective than simple conventional acupuncture or acupuncture at sphenopalatine ganglion alone."

There is accumulating evidence for the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for migraine in the general population but very little to no data on acupuncture during pregnancy. With this retrospective study, we wanted to determine whether an association exists between acupuncture treatment and preterm delivery and side effects of therapy. The initial study group was 68 women with migraine (29.78% with aura and 70.21% without aura), 47 of which responded to a questionnaire on acupuncture safety within 6 weeks of delivery. A so-called Formula Acupuncture was used for all these patients in order to permit comparison. Influence of acupuncture on gestational age at birth was carried out according to number of treatment sessions (more than and fewer than 10) and stratifying the study sample by age group (over and under 30 years) and risk pregnancy. Analysis showed no statistically significant difference in gestational duration between the two groups or an association between the number of acupuncture sessions and preterm delivery. Symptoms during treatment were generally transient or mild. The most common symptoms were relaxation, pain at the insertion sites, mild bleeding, and paresthesia. Our preliminary data indicate that acupuncture may be safe during pregnancy in women with migraine."
5,2019,35633026,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,"Objectives: To investigate previous treatment and clinical characteristics in migraine and tension-type headache patients at their first visit to a tertiary headache center. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study using data obtained from electronic questionnaires and medical charts. Migraine and tension-type headache patients were investigated at their first visit to the Danish Headache Center. Results: Out of 382 patients the main diagnoses of primary headaches were: 36% with episodic migraine, 43% with chronic migraine, 3% with episodic tension-type headache and 17% with chronic tension-type headache. The majority had attempted non-pharmacological treatment options such as physiotherapy (episodic migraine: 53%, chronic migraine: 68%, episodic tension-type headache: 50%, chronic tension-type headache: 65%) and acupuncture: (episodic migraine: 45%, chronic migraine: 62%, episodic tension-type headache: 17%, chronic tension-type headache: 51%). The majority of migraine patients had tried no more than one triptan (episodic migraine: 71%, chronic migraine: 66%). In total, 35% of episodic migraine and 19% of chronic migraine patients as well as 50% of episodic tension-type headache and 41% of chronic tension-type headache patients had never tried preventive medication. The headache under-response to treatment (HURT) questionnaire score was higher in chronic migraine (score 15) and chronic tension-type headache (score 16) patients than the episodic forms ( P 0.004). Conclusions: Headache patients had attempted several non-pharmacological treatments prior to their first visit at a tertiary headache center in Denmark. The limited use of acute and preventive treatment before the first visit demonstrates a need for better treatment at the primary and secondary care level."

Materials and methods: Twenty-six patients with migraine and 24 healthy controls were recruited. All patients underwent resting state functional MRI before and after 3 months of EA-C2-PNfS. We evaluated numerical rating scale, Headache Impact Test and Self-rating Depression Scale, which assesses depression. Healthy controls underwent MRI twice at 3-month interval without acupuncture. A FC analysis of the region of interest in the pain matrix was performed. Results: Twenty migraine patients and 23 healthy controls (44.9 ± 12.9 years) were included. Three patients had migraine with aura (MWA) (55.0 ± 18.0 years), 11 patients had migraine without aura (MWoA) (45.6 ± 14.6 years), and 6 patients had chronic migraine (CM) (40.8 ± 13.9 years).The clinical assessments significantly improved after EA-C2-PNfS in the MWoA group only. In FC analysis, the MWoA group showed a significant decrease after EA-C2-PNfS in FC between the right hypothalamus and left insula. Right hypothalamus-related FC was lower pre-acupuncture in the CM group than in the MWoA group. Conclusion: After EA-C2-PNfS for MWoA, significant changes in FC were observed at hypothalamus and insula. Our results indicated that EA-C2-PNfS may improve migraine headache by modifying pain-related FC."
5,2019,35232686,Can acupuncture prevent migraines?,acupuncture migraine,1.0,"Background: Acupuncture has been widely used to relieve migraine-related symptoms. However, the findings of previous systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) are still not completely consistent. Their quality is also unknown, so a comprehensive study is needed. Objective: To evaluate the reporting and methodological quality of these MAs concerning acupuncture for migraine, and summarize evidence about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for migraine. Search strategy: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Databases, Wanfang Data, and VIP databases were searched from inception to September 2020, with a comprehensive search strategy. Inclusion criteria: The pairwise MAs of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning migraine treated by acupuncture or acupuncture-based therapies, with a control group that received sham acupuncture, medication, no treatment, or acupuncture at different acupoints were included. Data extraction and analysis: Two independent investigators screened studies, extracted relevant data, and assessed reporting and methodological quality using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), then all results were cross-checked. Spearman correlation test was used to evaluate the correlation between reporting and methodological quality scores. Results: A total of 20 MAs were included in this study. The included MAs indicated that acupuncture was efficacious and safe in preventing and treating migraine when compared with control intervention. There was a high correlation between reporting and methodological quality scores (r s = 0.87, P 0.001). The quality of the included SRs needs to be improved mainly with regard to protocol and prospective registration, using a comprehensive search strategy, summarizing the strength of evidence body for key outcomes, a full list of excluded studies with reasons for exclusion, reporting of RCTs' funding sources, and assessing the potential impact of risk of bias in RCTs on MA results. Conclusion: Acupuncture is an effective and safe intervention for preventing and treating migraine, and could be considered as a good option for patients with migraine. However, the reporting and methodological quality of MAs included in this overview is suboptimal. In the future, AMSTAR 2 and PRISMA tools should be followed when making and reporting an SR with MA."
6,2019,31610669,Is amygdalin or laetrile an effective cancer treatment?,amygdalin laetrile cancer,0.0,"Background: Amygdalin is a natural compound primarily found in seeds of fruit trees. In the human body, it is hydrolyzed to benzaldehyde, glucose, and cyanide, which is considered the active component of amygdalin. The semi-synthetic form of amygdalin is known under the commercial name Laetrile® or as vitamin B17. Purpose: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of studies that evaluated the potential therapeutic effects of amygdalin in oncology. Preclinical studies provided information about the mechanisms of action of amygdalin in vitro and in vivo and its toxicity. Recent in vitro studies demonstrated the effects of amygdalin on the cell cycle, apoptosis, and synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, E-cadherin, and integrins &amp;#946;1 and &amp;#946;4. However, amygdalin exhibited no or low treatment efficiency in preclinical in vivo studies. Conversely, many case studies describe the anti-tumor effects of amygdalin, but these have not been confirmed in clinical trials. Only two clinical studies published almost 40 years ago focused on the safety of amygdalin administered orally and intravenously. Although these studies reported that amygdalin had no benefit in 178 cancer patients, this compound has recently come to the attention of both scientists and patients. The results of recent in vitro studies are promising and indicate that amygdalin has a oncopreventive effect, although this must be confirmed by in vivo studies and clinical trials. Considering its proven toxicity and unconvincing clinical effects, amygdalin cannot currently be recommended to oncology patients as a supportive treatment."
6,2019,29486614,Is amygdalin or laetrile an effective cancer treatment?,amygdalin laetrile cancer,0.0,"Amygdalin, named as 'laetrile' and 'vitamin B-17' was initially supposed to be a safe drug for cancer treatment and was recognized by followers of natural medicine since it has been considered to be hydrolyzed only in cancer cells releasing toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and thus destroying them. Unfortunately, current studies have shown that HCN is also released in normal cells, therefore it may not be safe for human organism. However, there have still been research works conducted on anti-cancer properties of this compound. In vitro experiments have shown induction of apoptosis by amygdalin as a result of increased expression of Bax protein and caspase-3 and reduced expression of antiapoptotic BcL-2protein. Amygdalin has also been shown to inhibit the adhesion of breast cancer cells, lung cancer cells and bladder cancer cells by decreased expression of integrin's, reduction of catenin levels and inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway, which may consequently lead to inhibition of metastases of cancer cells. It has also been revealed that amygdalin in renal cancer cells increased expression of p19 protein resulting in inhibition of cell transfer from G1-phase to S-phase, and thus inhibited cell proliferation. Other studies have indicated that amygdalin inhibits NF-kβ and NLRP3 signaling pathways, and consequently has anti-inflammatory effect due to reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as pro-IL-1β. Moreover, the effect of amygdalin on TGFβ/CTGF pathway, anti-fibrous activity and expression of follistatin resulting in activation of muscle cells growth has been reported. This compound might be applicable in the treatment of various cancer cell types."
6,2019,29308747,Is amygdalin or laetrile an effective cancer treatment?,amygdalin laetrile cancer,0.0,"Background: Amygdalin is a cyanogenic glycoside which is described as a naturally occurring anticancer agent. Current review highlights apoptosis-inducing attributes of amygdalin towards different cancers and its potential application as an anti-cancer agent in cancer therapy. Method: Data about amygdalin was retrieved from all major scientific databases i.e., PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scopus and Medline by using combination of keywords like amygdalin, apoptosis, laetrile, vitamin B- 17, pro-apoptotic proteins, anti-apoptotic proteins, hydrogen cyanide, mechanism of action of amygdalin and amygdalin therapy on humans. However, no specific time frame was followed for collection of data. Results: Data collected from already published articles revealed that apoptosis is a central process activated by amygdalin in cancer cells. It is suggested to stimulate apoptotic process by upregulating expression of Bax (proapoptotic protein) and caspase-3 and downregulating expression of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein). It also promotes arrest of cell cycle in G0/G1 phase and decrease number of cells entering S and G2/M phases. Thus, it is proposed to enhance deceleration of cell cycle by blocking cell proliferation and growth. Conclusion: The current review epitomizes published information and provides complete interpretations about all known anti-cancer mechanisms of amygdalin, possible role of naturally occurring amygdalin in fight against cancer and mistaken belief about cyanide toxicity causing potential of amygdalin. However, well-planned clinical trials are still needed to be conducted to prove effectiveness of this substance in vivo and to get approval for human use."

Still, evidence based research on amygdalin is sparse and its benefit controversial. Purpose: Since so many cancer patients consume amygdalin, and many clinicians administer it without clear knowledge of its mode of action, current knowledge has been summarized and the pros and cons of its use weighed. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted for amygdalin relevant reports using the PubMed database with the main search term ""Amygdalin"" or ""laetrile"", at times combined with ""cancer"", ""patient"", ""cyanide"" or ""toxic"". We did not exclude any ""unwanted"" articles. Additionally, internet sources authorized by governmental or national institutions have also been included. Sections: Individual chapters summarize pharmacokinetics, preclinical and clinical studies and toxicity. Conclusion: No convincing evidence showing that amygdalin induces rapid, distinct tumor regression in cancer patients, particularly in those with late-stage disease, is apparent. However, there is also no evidence that purified amygdalin, administered in ""therapeutic"" dosage, causes toxicity. Multiple aspects of amygdalin administration have not yet been adequately explored, making further investigation necessary to evaluate its actual therapeutic potential."

Case summary: A 68-year-old patient with cancer presented to the emergency department shortly after her first dose (3 g) of amygdalin with a reduced Glasgow Coma Score, seizures, and severe lactic acidosis requiring intubation and ventilation. The patient also ingested 4800 mg of vitamin C per day. She responded rapidly to hydroxocobalamin treatment. The adverse drug reaction was rated probable on the Naranjo probability scale. Discussion: Amygdalin and laetrile (a synthetic form of amygdalin) are commonly used as complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) for the treatment of cancer. Vitamin C is known to increase the in vitro conversion of amygdalin to cyanide and reduce body stores of cysteine, which is used to detoxify cyanide. Amygdalin has been used for decades by patients with cancer who are seeking alternative therapies, and severe reactions have not been reported with this dose. An interaction with vitamin C is a plausible explanation for this life-threatening response. Conclusions: This case highlights the fact that CAMs can produce life-threatening toxicity. This case also adds a further note of caution, namely, the potential for serious interactions between CAMs, particularly where there is no tradition of concomitant use."
7,2019,35833913,Can aspirin improve the lives of people with vascular dementia?,aspirin vascular dementia,0.0,"Background: Cerebral small vessel disease is a progressive disease of the brain's deep perforating blood vessels. It is usually diagnosed based on lesions seen on brain imaging. Cerebral small vessel disease is a common cause of stroke but can also cause a progressive cognitive decline. As antithrombotic therapy is an established treatment for stroke prevention, we sought to determine whether antithrombotic therapy might also be effective in preventing cognitive decline in people with small vessel disease. Objectives: To assess the effects of antithrombotic therapy for prevention of cognitive decline in people with small vessel disease on neuroimaging but without dementia. Search methods: We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Review Group's Specialised Register, and the Cochrane Stroke Group's Specialised Register; the most recent search was on 21 July 2021. We also searched MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases and two trials registries. We searched the reference lists of the articles retrieved from these searches. As trials with a stroke focus may include relevant subgroup data, we complemented these searches with a focussed search of all antithrombotic titles in the Cochrane Stroke Group database. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) of people with neuroimaging evidence of at least mild cerebral small vessel disease (defined here as white matter hyperintensities, lacunes of presumed vascular origin and subcortical infarcts) but with no evidence of dementia. The trials had to compare antithrombotic therapy of minimum 24 weeks' duration to no antithrombotic therapy (either placebo or treatment as usual), or compare different antithrombotic treatment regimens. Antithrombotic therapy could include antiplatelet agents (as monotherapy or combination therapy), anticoagulants or a combination. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened all the titles identified by the searches. We assessed full texts for eligibility for inclusion according to our prespecified selection criteria, extracted data to a proforma and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for RCTs. We evaluated the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Due to heterogeneity across included participants, interventions and outcomes of eligible trials, it was not possible to perform meta-analyses. Main results: We included three RCTs (3384 participants). One study investigated the effect of antithrombotic therapy in participants not yet on antithrombotic therapy; two studies investigated the effect of additional antithrombotic therapy, one in a population already taking a single antithrombotic agent and one in a mixed population (participants on an antithrombotic drug and antithrombotic-naive participants). Intervention and follow-up durations varied from 24 weeks to four years. Jia 2016 was a placebo-controlled trial assessing 24 weeks of treatment with DL-3-n-butylphthalide (a compound with multimodal actions, including a putative antiplatelet effect) in 280 Chinese participants with vascular cognitive impairment caused by subcortical ischaemic small vessel disease, but without dementia. There was very low-certainty evidence for a small difference in cognitive test scores favouring treatment with DL-3-n-butylphthalide, as measured by the 12-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (adjusted mean difference -1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.02 to -0.12), but this difference may not be clinically relevant. There was also very low-certainty evidence for greater proportional improvement measured with the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change-Plus Caregiver Input (57% with DL-3-n-butylphthalide versus 42% with placebo; P = 0.01), but there was no difference in other measures of cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating) or function. There was no evidence of a difference in adverse events between treatment groups. The SILENCE RCT compared antithrombotic therapy (aspirin) and placebo during four years of treatment in 83 participants with 'silent brain infarcts' who were on no prior antithrombotic therapy. There was very low-certainty evidence for no difference between groups across various measures of cognition and function, rates of stroke or adverse events. The Secondary Prevention of Subcortical Stroke Study (SPS3) compared dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) to aspirin alone in 3020 participants with recent lacunar stroke. There was low-certainty evidence of no effect on cognitive outcomes as measured by the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instruments (CASI) assessed annually over five years. There was also low-certainty evidence of no difference in the annual incidence of mild cognitive decline between the two treatment groups (9.7% with dual antiplatelet therapy versus 9.9% with aspirin), or the annual stroke recurrence rate (2.5% with dual antiplatelet therapy versus 2.7% with aspirin). Bleeding risk may be higher with dual antiplatelet therapy (hazard ratio (HR) 2.15, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.11; low certainty evidence), but there may be no significant increase in intracerebral bleeding risk (HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.93; low-certainty evidence). None of the included trials assessed the incidence of new dementia. Authors' conclusions: We found no convincing evidence to suggest any clinically relevant cognitive benefit of using antithrombotic therapy in addition to standard treatment in people with cerebral small vessel disease but without dementia, but there may be an increased bleeding risk with this approach. There was marked heterogeneity across the trials and the certainty of the evidence was generally poor."

Methods: Cox regression models with inverse probability of treatment weighting to model the underlying cardiovascular risk were used to assess the associations of low-dose ASA use with all-cause dementia, AD, and VD incidence in community-dwelling older adults from the German ESTHER study (N = 5258) and the UK Biobank (N = 305,394). Inclusion criteria were age of 55 years or older and completed drug assessment. Meta-analyses of the individual participant data from the two prospective cohort studies were performed. Results: Four hundred seventy-six cases of all-cause dementia, 157 cases of AD, and 183 cases of VD were diagnosed over a median of 14.3 years of follow-up in ESTHER. In the UK Biobank, 5584 participants were diagnosed with all-cause dementia, 2029 with AD, and 1437 with VD over a median of 11.6 years. The meta-analysis of both cohorts revealed a weak reduction in hazards for all-cause dementia (hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.96 [0.93 to 0.99]). The strongest protective effect of low-dose ASA was observed in participants with coronary heart disease (CHD) in both cohorts, and a significant interaction was detected. In particular, in meta-analysis, a 31% reduction in hazard for AD, 69% for VD and 34% for all-cause dementia were observed (HR [95% CI]: 0.69 [0.59 to 0.80], 0.31 [0.27 to 0.35], 0.46 [0.42 to 0.50], respectively). Furthermore, compared to non-users, users of low-dose ASA for 10 years or longer (who likely use it because they have CHD or a related diagnosis putting them at an increased risk for cardiovascular events) demonstrated a strong protective effect on all dementia outcomes, especially for VD (HR [95% CI]: 0.48 [0.42 to 0.56]) whereas no protective associations were observed with shorter low-dose ASA use. Conclusions: The protective potential of low-dose ASA for all-cause dementia, AD, and VD seems to strongly depend on pre-existing CHD and the willingness of patients to take it for a minimum of ten years."

Methods: Forty-five patients with cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke using cilostazol were enrolled as the study group and 45 patients using aspirin or clopidogrel were enrolled as the control group. Neuropsychiatric assessments were administered at the start of the study and after 6 months. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between the cognitive change and cilostazol use. Macrophage polarization were assessed using flow cytometry in 7 patients. Results: There were a significantly higher number of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease in the cilostazol group. No significant differences were observed in the cognitive change between the cilostazol and control groups. M1 macrophage subset increment were observed in the patient having a declined cognitive change. Conclusion: Cilostazol did not make a significant difference in cognitive change after ischemic stroke. M1 macrophage subset increment may indicate post stroke cognitive decline. Due to limited number of subjects, these findings should be examined further in large-scale randomized clinical trials."
7,2019,32090069,Can aspirin improve the lives of people with vascular dementia?,aspirin vascular dementia,0.0,"Background: Late onset depression (LOD) often occurs in the context of vascular disease and may be associated with risk of dementia. Aspirin is widely used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. However, its role in patients with LOD and risk of dementia remains inconclusive. Materials and Methods. A population-based study was conducted using data from National Health Insurance of Taiwan during 1996-2009. Patients fulfil diagnostic criteria for LOD with or without subsequent dementia (incident dementia) and among whom users of aspirin (75 mg daily for at least 6 months) were identified. The time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model was applied for multivariate analyses. Propensity scores with the one-to-one nearest-neighbor matching model were used to select matching patients. Cumulative incidence of incident dementia after diagnosis of LOD was calculated by Kaplan-Meier Method. Results: A total of 6028 (13.4%) and 40,411 (86.6%) patients were defined as, with and without diagnosis of LOD, among whom 2,424 (41.9%) were aspirin users. Patients with LOD had more comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and hypertension comparing to those without LOD. Among patients with LOD, aspirin users had lower incidence of subsequent incident dementia than non-users (Hazard Ratio = 0.734, 95% CI 0.641-0.841, p 0.001). After matching aspirin users with non-users by propensity scores-matching method, the cumulative incidence of incident dementia was significantly lower in aspirin users of LOD patients ( p 0.001). After matching aspirin users with non-users by propensity scores-matching method, the cumulative incidence of incident dementia was significantly lower in aspirin users of LOD patients (. Conclusions: Aspirin may be associated with a lower risk of incident dementia in patients with LOD. This beneficial effect of aspirin in LOD patients needs validation in prospective clinical trials and our results should be interpreted with caution."
7,2019,32005423,Can aspirin improve the lives of people with vascular dementia?,aspirin vascular dementia,0.0,"Objectives: Cardiovascular risk is associated with cognitive decline and this effect is attributed to brain pathology, including white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden. Low-dose aspirin is frequently recommended for reducing vascular events. We investigated the effect of taking aspirin on the association between cardiovascular risk, WMH burden and cognitive function. Study design: The study sample was drawn from 318 dementia-free adults aged 67-71 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 239 participants. Main outcome measures: WMH total lesion volumes (TLV) were extracted using the automated lesion segmentation algorithm. We measured cardiovascular risk by calculating ASSIGN score. Cognitive ability was measured using a test of processing speed. We developed structural equation models to test our hypothesis. Results: Sixty-eight participants (47.1 % male, mean age = 68.8 years) reported that they took aspirin. The demographic measures did not differ significantly by aspirin use. Among aspirin users, there was a strong negative association between WMH TLV and cognition (β = -0.43, p-value 0.001), while in non-users of aspirin the only significant predictor of poorer cognition was cardiovascular risk (β = -0.17, p-value = 0.001). Conclusions: Aspirin use moderates the negative effect of WMH burden on cognition. Considering WMH burden in addition to cardiovascular risk could improve the prediction of cognitive decline in older adults with aspirin use."
7,2019,30025445,Can aspirin improve the lives of people with vascular dementia?,aspirin vascular dementia,0.0,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with cognitive dysfunction. Materials and methods: Using the National Health Insurance Service database of the entire Korean adult prostate cancer population (n=236,391), data on ADT and cognitive dysfunction between 2008 and 2015 were analyzed. We excluded patients previously diagnosed with cognitive dysfunction, dementia, or a cerebral event history. We tested the effect of ADT on the risk of cognitive dysfunction using propensity score-matched Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Our final cohort comprised of 35,401 individuals with prostate cancer, including 24,567 men (70.6%) who underwent ADT. Results: During a mean follow-up period of 4.1 years, 4,741 patients were newly diagnosed with cognitive dysfunction. A statistically significant association was found between ADT and the risk of cognitive dysfunction (hazard ratio, 1.169; p=0.002). Meanwhile, age (≥ 70 years), diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular history, and peripheral vascular disease were identified as factors that contribute to the increased risk of cognitive dysfunction. In contrast, the use of statins and aspirin was associated with a lower risk of cognitive dysfunction. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients aged 70 years or older who underwent ADT had the lowest cumulative probability of remaining cognitive dysfunction-free (log-rank p 0.001). Conclusion: Our. Results: revealed an association between the use of ADT for the treatment of prostate cancer and an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction in a nationwide population-based study. This finding should be further evaluated in prospective studies."

The aim of this single-center, prospective study was to examine the prevalence, risk factors and prognostic significance of AR in patients with different clinical manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) over 24-month follow-up. Methods: We studied 104 patients with MRI confirmed CSVD, including those with recent lacunar stroke (LS, n=49), vascular parkinsonism (VaP, n=16) and dementia (VaD, n=39). Platelet aggregation was evaluated with electrode platelet aggregometry (Multiplate analyzer); AR was defined as a value of ≥300 AUC*min. All patients had 24-h ABPM performed at baseline. Radiological progression was recognized based on repeated MRI examinations. Results: The prevalence of AR was 26%, and it did not differ between LS, VaD, and VaP (22.4%, 28.2%, and 31.3%, respectively; p =0.7). The patients with AR had higher triglyceride levels (TG; 144.2±100 vs 109.7±48 mg/dl; p =0.09) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; 103.5±15.2 vs 91.7±10.5 mmHg; p 0.01) than did responders to aspirin (RTA). TG (OR 1.02; 95%CI 1-1.11; p =0.04) and MAP (OR 1.03; 95%CI 1.0-1.09; p =0.04) were independent of age, sex, statin and antihypertensive treatment risk factors for AR. The patients with AR more frequently experienced ischemic strokes than did those with RTA (OR 3.1; 98%CI 1.08-9.3; p =0.03) and had more radiological progression (OR 2.2; 95%CI 0.9-5.7; p =0.08). AR was independent of age, sex, baseline Fazekas score predictor of lacunar stroke (OR 3.79; 95%CI 1.19-12; p =0.02) and radiological progression (OR 2.9; 95%CI 1.04-8.3; p=0.04). Conclusions: The prevalence of AR was high and similar among the patients with LS, VaD, and VaP due to CSVD. Higher 24-h MAP and TG were independently related to the risk of AR. AR was associated with risk of radiological progression and lacunar strokes over 24 months of observation."
7,2019,29203753,Can aspirin improve the lives of people with vascular dementia?,aspirin vascular dementia,0.0,"Stroke was already diagnosed in the ancient times. For hundreds of years the treatment of this disease has changed radically. According to the current WHO definition, stroke is a clinical syndrome caused by focal or generalized brain injury that lasts more than 24 hours or leads to death and has no other cause than vascular. Stroke constitutes a big social and economic problem, as it can lead to death or disability. In the highly developed countries stroke is the third most common cause of adult deaths, the second leading cause of dementia, and the most common cause of disability. The consequences of stroke also include epilepsy and depression. In the twentieth century, stroke was only treated symptomatically and rehabilitation was limited to passive exercises. The first breakthrough in ischemic stroke therapy was the introduction of aspirin (ASA), followed by intravenous thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), initially available in our country only in the drug programs, and since 2009 it has been reimbursed by the National Health Fund (NFZ). Gradually invasive stroke treatment has been developed. Mechanical thrombectomy is currently only performed in selected centers, giving hope for more effective stroke treatment. The purpose of this work was to show how stroke treatment has changed over the centuries."
7,2019,29097299,Can aspirin improve the lives of people with vascular dementia?,aspirin vascular dementia,0.0,"Purpose: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is highly prevalent in older adults. Increasing evidence links SDB to the risk of dementia, mediated via a number of pathways, some of which may be attenuated by low-dose aspirin. This study will evaluate, in a healthy older cohort, the prospective relationship between SDB and cognitive function, changes in retinal and cerebral microvasculature, and determine whether low-dose aspirin ameliorates the effects of SDB on these outcomes over 3years. Design: SNORE-ASA is a sub-study of the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) randomised, multi-centre, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effect of daily 100mg aspirin on disability-free and dementia-free survival in the healthy older adult aged 70 and over. At baseline, 1400 ASPREE participants successfully underwent a home sleep study with a home sleep study screening device for SDB; and 296 underwent both 1.5 Tesla brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and retinal vascular imaging (RVI). Cognitive testing, brain MRI and RVI is being repeated after 3years. Primary outcome measures: Change in the modified mini-mental state examination score. Secondary outcome measures are changes in other cognitive tests, and changes in abnormal parameters on RVI and volume of white matter hyper-intensities on brain MRI. Conclusion: Identifying preventive therapies for delaying the onset of dementia is of paramount importance. The results of this study will help clarify the impact of the SDB on risk of cognitive decline and cerebral small vessel disease, and whether low-dose aspirin can ameliorate cognitive decline in the setting of SDB.

7,2019,29036821,Can aspirin improve the lives of people with vascular dementia?,aspirin vascular dementia,0.0,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence is increasing globally and typically progresses for several years prior to clinical presentation of dementia. Renal dysfunction and vascular disease have been reported in association with dementia in several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, and may contribute to AD risk. Experimental and observational studies suggest amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance may be impaired in chronic kidney disease (CKD) indicating a mechanism for increased AD risk. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between individuals with AD and cognitively intact controls, controlling for potential confounding factors. Methods: A cross-sectional, case-control study was carried out in 317 cognitively normal participants and 253 cases with a clinical diagnosis of AD in a UK tertiary care dementia clinic. Associations were considered using logistic regression adjusting for confounding variables (age, APOEɛ4 genotype, systolic blood pressure, education (left school at 14), and smoking status). Results: AD cases were older than cognitively intact controls, had lower MMSE scores, were more likely to have at least one APOEɛ4 allele, had higher rates of smoking, were more likely to be taking aspirin and/or clopidogrel, and had lower blood pressure. We found no significant association between eGFR and AD both before and following adjustment for appropriate confounders. Conclusion: This study failed to find an association between eGFR and AD in a cross-sectional sample study of elderly white individuals."

The efficacy of melatonin and related agonists to modulate biological rhythms can be assessed using two well-validated mouse models of rhythmic behaviors. These models serve as predictive measures of therapeutic efficacy for treatment of circadian phase disorders caused by internal (e.g., clock gene mutations, blindness, depression, seasonal affective disorder) or external (e.g., shift work, travel across time zones) causes in humans. Here we provide background and detailed protocols for quantitative assessment of the magnitude and efficacy of melatonin receptor ligands in mouse circadian phase-shift and re-entrainment paradigms. The utility of these models in the discovery of novel therapeutics acting on melatonin receptors will also be discussed."
8,2019,36065903,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,"The devastating chronic central post stroke pain is associated with variety of comorbidities. Disrupted sleep is a severe comorbidity, causing an increase in the suicide rate, due to CPSP's pain symptom. Melatonin is a well-known jet-lag compound, which helps in entrainment of sleep cycle. Accordingly, whether melatonin as a therapeutic measurement for the regulation of sleep disturbance related to central post stroke pain remains unclear. Exogenous melatonin administration entrained the disrupted 24 h circadian cycle, more effectively after 2 and 3 week of administration. The effect of melatonin was persisted on 4th week too, when melatonin administration was discontinued. Also, melatonin ameliorated the pain due to distorted sleep-activity behavior after melatonin administration for 3 weeks. The low levels of melatonin in blood plasma due to CPSP were restored after 3 weeks of melatonin administration. After 30 mg/kg melatonin administrations for 3 weeks, all the disrupted resting and activity behaviors were reduced during light and dark periods. The results suggested that melatonin significantly ameliorated CPSP's pain symptoms and comorbid sleep disturbance showing in activity behavior."
8,2019,34493186,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,"Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWDs) are a distinct class of sleep disorders caused by alterations to the circadian time-keeping system, its entrainment mechanisms, or a mismatch between the endogenous circadian rhythm and the external environment. The main clinical manifestations are insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness that often lead to clinically meaningful distress or cause mental, physical, social, occupational, educational, or other functional impairment. CRSWDs are easily mistaken for insomnia or early waking up, resulting in inappropriate treatment. CRSWDs can be roughly divided into two categories, namely, intrinsic CRSWDs, in which sleep disturbances are caused by alterations to the endogenous circadian rhythm system due to chronic changes in the regulation or capture mechanism of the biological clock, and extrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, in which sleep disorders, such as jet lag or shift-work disorder, result from environmental changes that cause a mismatch between sleep-wakefulness times and internal circadian rhythms. Sleep diaries, actigraphy, and determination of day and night phase markers (dim light melatonin onset and core body temperature minimum) have all become routine diagnostic methods for CRSWDs. Common treatments for CRSWD currently include sleep health education, time therapy, light therapy, melatonin, and hypnotic drug therapy. Here, we review the progress in the epidemiology, etiology, diagnostic evaluation, diagnostic criteria, and treatment of intrinsic CRSWD, with emphasis on the latter, in the hope of bolstering the clinical diagnosis and treatment of CRSWDs."
8,2019,34365685,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,"Melatonin pleiotropically regulates physiological events and has a putative regulatory role in the circadian clock desynchrony-mediated Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we investigated perturbations in the hepatic circadian clock gene, and Nrf2-HO-1 oscillations in conditions of high-fat high fructose (HFHF) diet and/or jet lag (JL)-mediated NAFLD. Melatonin treatment (100 µM) to HepG2 cells led to an improvement in oscillatory pattern of clock genes (Clock, Bmal1, and Per) in oleic acid (OA)-induced circadian desynchrony, while Cry, Nrf2, and HO-1 remain oblivious of melatonin treatment that was also validated by circwave analysis. C57BL/6J mice subjected to HFHF and/or JL, and treated with melatonin showed an improvement in the profile of lipid regulatory genes (CPT-1, PPARa, and SREBP-1c), liver function (AST and ALT) and histomorphology of fatty liver. A detailed scrutiny revealed that hepatic mRNA and protein profiles of Bmal1 (at ZT6) and Clock (at ZT12) underwent corrective changes in oscillations, but moderate corrections were recorded in other components of clock genes (Per1, Per2, and Cry2). Melatonin induced changes in oscillations of anti-oxidant genes (Nrf2, HO-1, and Keap1) subtly contributed in the overall improvement in NAFLD recorded herein. Taken together, melatonin induced reprograming of hepatic core clock and Nrf2-HO-1 genes leads to an improvement in HFHF/JL-induced NAFLD."

The relationship between the structure of sleep and impaired executive functions, the level of social maladjustment in patients with ADHD has been proven. Typical of children with ADHD are difficulty in going to sleep and falling asleep for a long time (resistance to sleep time), increased motor activity associated with sleep, including the association of ADHD with Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic leg movement syndrome (PLMS), daytime sleepiness. The presence of circadian desynchrony in children with ADHD explains the relationship between chronotype, circadian typology, and clinical manifestations of the syndrome. Multidirectional data on the representation of REM sleep by nocturnal polysomnography in children with ADHD depend on age. However, the change in the proportion of REM sleep during the night is considered as a leading factor in the pathogenesis of ADHD manifestations. Various variants of metabolic disorders of melatonin, dopamine, serotonin, aggravated by social jet lag, are considered by the conjugatedcommon pathogenetic mechanisms of sleep disturbance and ADHD. As well as changes in the concentration of iron and ferritin in the blood, which may explain the frequency of RLS and PLMS in children with ADHD. The change in the number of sleep cycles during the night in patients has been demonstrated. Possible strategies for correcting sleep disorders in children with ADHD and their impact on the manifestation of ADHD are discussed."

Blue-blocking glasses have been studied as a sleep intervention for insomnia, delayed sleep-phase disorder, shift work, jet lag, and nonpathologic sleep improvement. Blue-blocking glasses have also been studied as a treatment for bipolar disorder, major depression, and postpartum depression. Blue-blocking glasses improve sleep by inducing dim-light melatonin onset by reducing activation of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) which are most sensitive to blue light and are a major input for circadian regulation; their mechanism for mood regulation is unclear but may be similar to that of dark therapy for bipolar disorder where patients are kept in darkness for an extended period every night. A systematic search of the scientific literature identified a total of 29 experimental publications involving evening wear of blue-blocking glasses for sleep or mood disorders. These consisted of 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in journals with a total of 453 patients, 5 uncontrolled trials, 1 case series, 1 case study, and 6 abstracts from conference proceedings. Only 1 case study and 1 RCT were for acutely manic patients but both found substantial decreases in manic symptoms with the use of blue-blocking glasses; these give preliminary clinical evidence of efficacy that makes blue-blocking glasses a high-yield intervention to study for bipolar disorder. Findings in the 3 publications for major depression and postpartum depression were heterogeneous and conflicting as to their efficacy. Out of the 24 publications focusing on sleep, there was substantial evidence for blue-blocking glasses being a successful intervention for reducing sleep onset latency in patients with sleep disorders, jet lag, or variable shift work schedules. Given the well-established biological mechanism and clinical research showing that blue-blocking glasses are effective for inducing sleep, they are a viable intervention to recommend to patients with insomnia or a delayed sleep phase."
8,2019,33849354,Can melatonin be used to reduce jet lag?,melatonin jet lag,1.0,"Night work can lead to social jetlag (SJL), which can be briefly defined as the difference between social and biological time. In this sense, SJL has been viewed as a proxy for circadian misalignment. Studies have suggested that SJL may modify physiological processes, such as blood pressure, glucose metabolism, cortisol, and melatonin production. Therefore, we aimed to verify the correlation between SJL and nocturnal inhibition of melatonin production estimated by the concentration of its urinary metabolite (6-sulfatoximelatonin). The study included day workers (n = 9) and night workers (n = 13) from a public maternity hospital in the city of São Paulo. A questionnaire was used to obtain sociodemographic data, life habits, working conditions, and the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ shift ) was used to assess chronotype. Urine was collected on workdays and days off to estimate the concentration of 6-sulfatoximelatonin (aMT6s), quantified by the ELISA method. We found SJL 13 times higher for night workers (10.6 h) than day workers (0.8 h). The excretion of aMT6s in night workers was statistically different on workdays as opposed to days off, with the lowest excretion on workdays, as expected. SJL was correlated with the aMT6s's delta between the night off and night on among night workers, indicating that the higher is the SJL, the lower is the melatonin production. As expected, social jetlag was higher among night workers, compared to day workers. Moreover, our findings showed that melatonin concentration is directly correlated with SJL."

Misalignment between the endogenous biological clock and exogenous light-dark cycle can cause significant distress and dysfunction, and treatment aims for resynchronization with the external clock and environment. This article begins with a brief historical context of progress in the understanding of circadian rhythms, and then provides an overview of circadian neurobiology and the endogenous molecular clock. Various tools used in the diagnosis of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, including sleep diaries and actigraphy monitoring, are then discussed, as are the therapeutic applications of strategically timed light therapy, melatonin, and other behavioral and pharmacological therapies including the melatonin agonist tasimelteon. Management strategies towards each major human circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorder, as outlined in the current International Classification of Sleep Disorders - Third Edition, including jet lag and shift work disorders, delayed and advanced sleep-wake phase rhythm disorders, non-24-h sleep-wake rhythm disorder, and irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder are summarized.

Alterations in circadian rhythm can lead to chronic disease and impaired sleep. The circadian rhythmicity in human beings is represented by a complex phenotype. Indeed, over a 24-h period, a person's preferred time to be more active or to sleep can be expressed in the concept of morningness-eveningness. Three chronotypes are distinguished: Morning, Neither, and Evening-types. Interindividual differences in chronotypes need to be considered to reduce the negative effects of circadian disruptions on health. In the present review, we examine the bi-directional influences of the rest-activity circadian rhythm and sleep-wake cycle in chronic pathologies and disorders. We analyze the concept and the main characteristics of the three chronotypes."

CRSWD are a distinct class of sleep disorders caused by alterations of the circadian time-keeping system, its entrainment mechanisms, or a misalignment of the endogenous circadian rhythm and the external environment. In these disorders, the timing of the primary sleep episode is either earlier or later than desired, irregular from day-to-day, and/or sleep occurs at the wrong circadian time. While there are incomplete and insufficient prevalence data, CRSWD likely affect at least 800,000 and perhaps as many as 3 million individuals in the United States, and if Shift Work Disorder and Jet Lag are included, then many millions more are impacted. The SRS Advocacy Taskforce has identified CRSWD as a class of sleep disorders for which additional high-quality research could have a significant impact to improve patient care. Participants were selected for their expertise and were assigned to one of three working groups: Phase Disorders, Entrainment Disorders, and Other. Each working group presented a summary of the current state of the science for their specific CRSWD area, followed by discussion from all participants. The outcome of those presentations and discussions are presented here."

Using young male asymptomatic participants in Experiment 1, we systematically examined the distribution of PPTs bilaterally in the range of Th1-L5 at measurement points 2 and 4 cm from the midline. PPTs were found to be higher in the lumbar segments of the paraspinal muscles than in the thoracic segments, and in muscles closer to the vertebrae (2 vs. 4 cm from the midline). The PPTs did not differ between the left and right sides in each segment. In Experiment 2, LC was applied by asking a part of participants recruited in Experiment 1 to fall their trunk from a starting position (parallel to the floor) to 40° flexed position, and then made it back as quickly as possible to the starting position. This cycle was repeated until participants could not keep contractions (30 times/set, 25.4 ± 10.6 sets). PPTs of the LC group decreased prominently in the lower thoracic and lumbar segments, and the decrease was more evident 24 h after LC compared to that 48 h after. In contrast, PPTs in the control group without LC remained unchanged. These results provided broad topographic images of PPTs in the thoracolumbar paraspinal muscles of young male participants with and without LC, and the obtained PPT maps could be a useful guide for better treatment of exercise-induced myofascial pain in the lower back."

However, there are no clear recommendations for using DN in low back pain (LBP). Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the novel DN program for reducing pain intensity and improving functional efficiency in patients with chronic LBP. A group of 40 patients with chronic LBP due to the L5-S1 discopathy were eligible and randomized into experimental (n = 20) and control (n = 20) groups. The DN program was performed for the experimental group according to the Five Regulatory Systems (FRS) concept. The control group received sham therapy using placebo needles. DN sessions were performed twice a week for 4 weeks. A single needling application lasted 60 min. Both groups received standard treatment and physical exercise of LBP for 1 month. Subjective pain was measured by a visual analog scale (VAS), functional efficiency was assessed with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and the lower spine range of motion was measured with the Schober test. There were significant differences in pain reduction (VAS) in both groups (p 0.001). The strongest analgesic effect in the DN group yielded 6.45 points immediately after the therapy, 6.2 points after 1 month, and 6 points after 3 months. The DN group scored higher VAS reduction than the control group (p 0.001). There were significant differences in the functional state (ODI) in the experimental group (p 0.001). There was a significant ODI decrease by 18.1 points, after 1 month by 18.9 points, and after 3 months by 17.6 points. No significant differences were found in the control group (p &gt; 0.05). Intergroup differences were observed in the functional efficiency in ODI in all measurement time-points (p 0.001). There were significant differences in the range of motion (Schober test) in the DN group (main effect: p 0.001). For all measurements, differences (p 0.001) were observed in favor of DN compared to the control. In conclusion, DN program according to the FRS concept stands for the novel treatment method supplemented by an exercise program, effectively reducing pain and improving functional efficiency in LBP patients."

Abdominal bracing has also been shown to improve LBP and facilitate several trunk muscles. We aimed to investigate the effects of walking velocity and abdominal bracing on the activation of trunk muscles in chronic LBP patients during walking. Forty-six volunteers with chronic LBP underwent walking exercise on the treadmill without (""non-braced walking"") and with abdominal bracing (""braced walking"") at speeds of 4, 5, and 6 km/h, with the surface electrodes placed on their trunk muscles to measure muscle activity. The root mean square values of the surface electromyography amplitude data were obtained at the multifidus of lower (ML) and upper lumbar (MU), erector spinae of lower lumbar (EL) and thoracic (ET), rectus abdominis (RA), and external oblique (EO). All muscles activated significantly more at faster walking. The ""braced walking"" facilitated the ET and RA significantly more than the ""non-braced walking"". The interaction between the walking speed and abdominal bracing was significant at ML, MU, and RA. The increase in muscle activation observed at lower speed diminished as speed increased. Since ""braced walking"" seems to additionally facilitate the trunk muscles especially at slower gait speeds, patients who cannot walk fast may still be able to train their muscles by ""braced walking."""
11,2019,36042435,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,"Background: A considerable number of studies have suggested that there is a strong correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D or vitamin D levels and overall health, with reported impacts ranging from mental health and vital organ health to musculoskeletal health. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and identify its associated factors among patients with musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) currently seeking medical attention. Methods: A total of 143 patients with MSDs were randomly selected for blood sample collection to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the study participants. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to compute the adjusted odds ratio. Results: Overall, 53.1% of patients had vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency was more prevalent among patients with higher body mass index, a bachelor's degree, lower sun exposure time, and lower serum calcium levels and those living in an urban setting. The multiple logistic regression model suggested that the duration of weekly sun exposure and living location were the independent predictors of vitamin D deficiency. Conclusion: It is recommended for patients with MSDs to participate in routine physical exercise, consume calcium- and vitamin D-enriched foods, and have regular sun exposure for minimizing the risk of vitamin D deficiency."

In this review of the related studies on TC, the authors explore its origin and development; summarize its therapeutic effect in treating depression, low back pain and other diseases; and further analyze its underlying mechanism. According to the literature, TC was primarily applied in the field of orthopedics and then was gradually used in neurology, psychiatry and psychology. It provides a new means for the treatment of depression, lower back pain, multiple sclerosis and other diseases. There are two potential mechanisms: physiological and psychological. In the future, exercise effects, adverse effects and exercise prescriptions of TC should be explored with large samples and high-quality randomized controlled trials."

Methods: Retrospectively analyze the clinical data of patients with COVID-19 caused by Omicron variant admitted by medical team of Tianjin Third Central Hospital during the period of supporting Tianjin COVID-19 designated hospital from January 8 to February 20, 2022. Patients who met the diagnostic criteria for common COVID-19 and had risk factors for developing severe disease or had pulse oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) ≤ 0.93 after exercise without supplementary oxygen were enrolled. Patients were divided into APP group and control group according to whether they completed the daily 12-hours APP in the first three days after enrollment. Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, COVID-19 vaccination status, laboratory examination, disease progression (progression to severe), time to nucleic acid negative conversion, length of hospital stay, and adverse reactions and tolerability [visual analog scale (VAS) score (the higher the score, the worse the tolerability] during APP were evaluated in two groups. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), SpO 2 /inhaled oxygen concentration (FiO 2 ) ratio and ROX index (ROXI) were compared between two groups at enrollment, 3rd and 7th day after enrollment. Results: There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, vaccination rates of COVID-19 and laboratory tests between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in IL-6, CRP, SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and ROXI between two groups at the time of enrollment. Compared with the group at the time of enrollment, SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and ROXI in APP group increased significantly at the 3rd day after enrollment [SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio: 461.90 (457.10, 466.70) vs. 446.67 (437.14, 457.10), ROXI: 25.40 (23.33, 25.93) vs. 22.57 (21.86, 24.40), all P 0.05], and the levels of IL-6 and CRP in control group were significantly increased [IL-6 (ng/L): 18.30 (6.50, 37.75) vs. 7.40 (5.10, 11.15), CRP (mg/L): 11.46 (2.11, 17.96) vs. 4.11 (1.72, 9.05), all P 0.05].

At the 7th day of enrollment,there were no significant differences in IL-6, CRP, SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and ROXI between two groups. There were no severe cases in both groups. The time of nucleic acid negative conversion and length of hospital stay in APP group were significantly shorter than those in control group [10.0 (8.0, 12.0) days vs. 11.0 (9.0, 13.0) days, 12.0 (10.0, 14.0) days vs. 14.0 (12.0,16.0) days, respectively, all P 0.05]. The main adverse reaction during APP was back pain, and the incidence in APP group was slightly lower than that in control group, but the difference was not statistically significant [17.9% (17/95) vs. 26.5% (27/102), P = 0.149]. VAS score in control group was significantly higher than that in APP group [score: 2.5 (2.0, 4.0) vs. 2.0 (1.0, 3.0), P = 0.004].

Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from study inception until January 2021. Randomized control trials evaluating both muscle morphometry and pain or disability in individuals with chronic low back pain were included. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by 2 reviewers independently. Modified Downs and Black tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach were used to assess the risk of bias and quality of evidence, respectively. A meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model with mean difference or standardized mean difference (SMD). Results: Of 3459 studies initially identified, 15 studies were included, and 13 studies were selected for meta-analysis. The results revealed no differences in the resting thickness of the transversus abdominis, internal and external oblique, and lumbar multifidus muscles in studies that compared MCT with other interventions. The transversus abdominis muscles contraction ratio was greater (SMD = 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.0 to 1.85) and lower pain (weighted mean difference: -1.07 cm; 95% CI, -1.91 to -0.22 cm; P = .01) and disability (SMD = -0.86; 95% CI, -1.42 to -0. 29; P .01) scores were found in the groups who underwent MCT compared with other interventions. Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that motor control exercise training increased the transverse abdominis contraction ratio (muscle activation) and improved the level of pain and disability compared to other interventions in people with chronic low back pain. However, motor control exercise training was not superior to other interventions in increasing the resting thickness of deep abdominal and lumbar multifidus muscles in intervention times less than 12 weeks."

Aim: To determine the effects of a remote therapeutic physical exercise program (TPEP), based on telehealth, on functional physical capacity in people with knee or hip osteoarthritis. Patients and methods: An eight-week TPEP was undertaken by 36 participants with a mean age of 68 years. The control group received printed exercise instructions, while the experimental group received the same instructions plus TPEP using tutorial videos and voice messaging via WhatsApp. Both groups were evaluated at baseline and the end of the intervention with the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), Barthel index (BI), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), senior fitness test and with the Visual Analog Scale for pain (VAS). Results: The experimental group decreased the VAS score and improved tandem balance, three-meter walk, sit and stand 5 times, sit and stand in 30 seconds, push-ups in 30 seconds, two minutes' walk, join the right hand behind the back and SPPB general score. The control group increased the BI score and improved the three meters walking test, sitting, and standing 5 times, sit and stand 30 seconds chair test, 2 minutes walking test and the SPPB general score. No differences between groups were observed for the LEFS scale, BI, VAS and functional capacity. Conclusions: A TPEP based on telehealth has similar effectiveness than a TPEP based on traditional paper-based intervention to improve functional physical capacity in patients with OA.

11,2019,35776492,Can exercises relieve lower back pain?,exercise lower back pain,1.0,"Background: Chronic diseases contribute to high rates of disability and mortality. Patient engagement in chronic disease self-management is an essential component of chronic disease models of health care. Wearables provide patient-centered health data in real time, which can help inform self-management decision-making. Despite the perceived benefits of wearables in improving chronic disease self-management, their influence on health care outcomes remains poorly understood. Objective: This review aimed to examine the influence of wearables on health care outcomes in individuals with chronic diseases through a systematic review of the literature. Methods: A narrative systematic review was conducted by searching 6 databases for randomized and observational studies published between January 1, 2016, and July 1, 2021, that included the use of a wearable intervention in a chronic disease group to assess its impact on a predefined outcome measure. These outcomes were defined as any influence on the patient or clinician experience, cost-effectiveness, or health care outcomes as a result of the wearable intervention. Data from the included studies were extracted based on 6 key themes, which formed the basis for a narrative qualitative synthesis. All outcomes were mapped against each component of the Quadruple Aim of health care. The guidelines of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement were followed in this study. Results: A total of 30 articles were included; studies reported 2446 participants (mean age: range 10.1-74.4 years), and the influence of 14 types of wearables on 18 chronic diseases was presented. The most studied chronic diseases were type 2 diabetes (4/30, 13%), Parkinson disease (3/30, 10%), and chronic lower back pain (3/30, 10%). The results were mixed when assessing the impact on a predefined primary outcome, with 50% (15/30) of studies finding a positive influence on the studied outcome and 50% (15/30) demonstrating a nil effect. There was a positive effect of 3D virtual reality systems on chronic pain in 7% (2/30) of studies that evaluated 2 distinct chronic pain syndromes. Mixed results were observed in influencing exercise capacity; weight; and biomarkers of disease, such as hemoglobin A 1c , in diabetes. In total, 155 outcomes were studied. Most (139/155, 89.7%) addressed the health care outcomes component. This included pain (11/155, 7.5%), quality of life (7/155, 4.8%), and physical function (5/155, 3.4%). Approximately 7.7% (12/155) of outcome measures represented the patient experience component, with 1.3% (2/155) addressing the clinician experience and cost. Conclusions: Given their popularity and capability, wearables may play an integral role in chronic disease management. However, further research is required to generate a strong evidence base for safe and effective implementation.

Completion of the seventh round of the Manicaland Survey in 2018-2019 provided the opportunity to assess the state of the epidemic prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aims were to: a) estimate HIV seroprevalence and assess whether prevalence has declined since the last round of the survey (2012-2013), b) describe and analyse the socio-demographic and behavioural risk factors for HIV infection and c) describe the HIV treatment cascade. Methods: Participants were administered individual questionnaires collecting data on socio-demographic characteristics, sexual relationships, HIV prevention methods and treatment access, and were tested for HIV. Descriptive analyses were followed by univariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors for HIV seropositvity using logistic regression modelling based on the proximate-determinants framework. Results: HIV prevalence was 11.3% [95% CI; 10.6-12.0] and was higher in females than males up to 45-49 years. Since 2012-2013 HIV prevalence has significantly declined in 30-44 year-olds in males, and 20-44 year-olds in females. The HIV epidemic has aged since 2012-2013, with an increase in the mean age of HIV positive persons from 38 to 41 years. Socio-demographic determinants of HIV prevalence were church denomination in males, site-type, wealth-status, employment sector and alcohol use in females, and age and marital status in both sexes. Behavioural determinants associated with increased odds of HIV were a higher number of regular sexual partners (lifetime), non-regular sexual partners (lifetime) and condom use in both sexes, and early sexual debut and concomitant STIs in females; medical circumcision was protective in males. HIV status awareness among participants testing positive in our study was low at 66.2%. ART coverage amongst all participants testing positive for HIV in our study was 65.0% and was lower in urban areas than rural areas, particularly in males. Conclusions: Prevalence has declined, and ART coverage increased, since 2012-2013. Majority of the associations with prevalence hypothesised by the theoretical framework were not observed in our data, likely due to underreporting of sexual risk behaviours or the treatment-as-prevention effect of ART curtailing the probability of transmission despite high levels of sexual risk behaviour. Further reductions in HIV incidence require strengthened primary prevention, HIV testing and linkage to risk behaviour counselling services. Our results serve as a valuable baseline against which to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV prevalence and its determinants in Manicaland, Zimbabwe, and target interventions appropriately."

In South Africa, United States Agency for International Development VMMC partners provide technical assistance to the Department of Health, at national and provincial levels in support of the establishment of VMMC sites as well as in providing direct VMMC services at site level since April 2012. We describe the outcomes of the Right to Care (RTC) VMMC program implemented in South Africa from 2012 to 2017. Methods: This retrospective study was undertaken at RTC supported facilities across six provinces. Young males aged ≥10 years who presented at these facilities from 1 July 2012 to 31 September 2017 were included. Outcomes were VMMC uptake, HIV testing uptake and rate of adverse events (AEs). Using a de-identified observational database of these clients, summary statistics of the demographic characteristics and outcomes were calculated. Results: There were a total 1,001,226 attendees of which 998,213 (99.7%) were offered VMMC and had a median age of 15 years (IQR = 12-23 years). Of those offered VMMC, 99.6% (994,293) consented, 96.7% (965,370) were circumcised and the majority (46.3%) were from Gauteng province. HIV testing uptake was 71% with a refusal rate of 15%. Of the newly diagnosed HIV positives, 64% (6,371 / 9,972) referrals were made. The rate of AEs, defined as bleeding, infection, and insufficient skin removal) declined from 3.26% in 2012 to 1.17% in 2017. There was a reduction in infection-related AEs from 2,448 of the 2,602 adverse events (94.08%) in 2012 to 129 of the 2,069 adverse events (6.23%) in 2017. Conclusion: There was a high VMMC uptake with a decline in AEs over time. Adolescent men contributed the most to the circumcised population, an indication that the young population accesses medical circumcision more. VMMC programs need to implement innovative demand creation strategies to encourage older males (20-34 years) at higher risk of HIV acquisition to get circumcised for immediate impact in reduction of HIV incidence. HIV prevalence in the total population increased with increasing age, notably in clients above 25 years."
12,2019,36083991,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"Background: Couples HIV Counselling and Testing (CHCT) has been found to be potentially beneficial than individual HIV Counselling and Testing for prevention and treatment of HIV. However, there are few health care opportunities for men and women to access health services together, leading to underutilization of CHCT service. Integrating female Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services into male-dominated service could be more effective than trying to integrate men's health services into female-dominated health services. A potential site for male-female service integration could be Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) centers. Methodology: We conducted a qualitative study in Lilongwe, Malawi between June to August 2018. Twenty VMMC clients, 20 peers and 20 VMMC providers completed individual in-depth interviews to share their opinions on what they thought about integrating CHCT and other SRH Services into VMMC services. These proposed SRH services include family planning, cervical cancer screening, sexually transmitted infection management and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Content analysis was used to analyze the results. Results: All participants were receptive to integration of CHCT, and most accepted the integration of SRH services into VMMC Services. Most VMMC clients, peers and care providers said that CHCT integration would help couples to know their HIV status, prevent HIV transmission, encourage healthy relationships, and provide a chance for women to participate in VMMC counselling and wound care. However, integration of other services, such as family planning and cervical cancer screening, drew mixed opinions among participants. Most VMMC clients, peers and providers felt that integration of services would promote male involvement and increase men's knowledge in feminine sexual reproductive health services. A few providers expressed concerns over service integration, citing reasons such as overcrowding, work overload, gender mixing, and lack of provider capacity and space. Most participants supported integrating PrEP with VMMC Services and felt that PrEP would complement VMMC in HIV prevention. Few providers, peers and VMMC clients felt the addition of PrEP to VMMC services would lead to high-risk sexual activity that would then increase the risk for HIV acquisition. A few participants recommended community sensitization when integrating some of sexual reproductive health services into VMMC Services to mitigate negative perceptions about VMMC services and encourage service uptake among couples. Conclusion: Most participants service providers, VMMC clients and Peers were receptive to integrating SRH services, particularly HIV prevention services such as CHCT and PrEP, into male dominated VMMC services. Adequate community sensitization is required when introducing other SRH services into VMMC services."
12,2019,35969453,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"Background: Twitter is becoming an increasingly important avenue for people to seek information about HIV prevention. Tweets about HIV prevention may reflect or influence current norms about the acceptability of different HIV prevention methods. Therefore, it may be useful to empirically investigate trends in the level of attention paid to different HIV prevention topics on Twitter over time. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to investigate temporal trends in the frequency of tweets about different HIV prevention topics on Twitter between 2014 and 2019. Methods: We used the Twitter application programming interface to obtain English-language tweets employing #HIVPrevention between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019 (n=69,197, globally). Using iterative qualitative content analysis on samples of tweets, we developed a keyword list to categorize the tweets into 10 prevention topics (eg, condom use, preexposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) and compared the frequency of tweets mentioning each topic over time. We assessed the overall change in the proportions of #HIVPrevention tweets mentioning each prevention topic in 2019 as compared with 2014 using chi-square and Fisher exact tests. We also conducted descriptive analyses to identify the accounts posting the most original tweets, the accounts retweeted most frequently, the most frequently used word pairings, and the spatial distribution of tweets in the United States compared with the number of state-level HIV cases. Results: PrEP (13,895 tweets; 20.08% of all included tweets) and HIV testing (7688, 11.11%) were the most frequently mentioned topics, whereas condom use (2941, 4.25%) and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP; 823, 1.19%) were mentioned relatively less frequently. The proportions of tweets mentioning PrEP (327/2251, 14.53%, in 2014, 5067/12,971, 39.1%, in 2019; P≤.001), HIV testing (208/2251, 9.24%, in 2014, 2193/12,971, 16.91% in 2019; P≤.001), and PEP (25/2251, 1.11%, in 2014, 342/12,971, 2.64%, in 2019; P≤.001) were higher in 2019 compared with 2014, whereas the proportions of tweets mentioning abstinence, condom use, circumcision, harm reduction, and gender inequity were lower in 2019 compared with 2014. The top retweeted accounts were mostly UN-affiliated entities; celebrities and HIV advocates were also represented. Geotagged #HIVPrevention tweets in the United States between 2014 and 2019 (n=514) were positively correlated with the number of state-level HIV cases in 2019 (r=0.81, P≤.01). Conclusions: Twitter may be a useful source for identifying HIV prevention trends. During our evaluation period (2014-2019), the most frequently mentioned prevention topics were PrEP and HIV testing in tweets using #HIVPrevention. Strategic responses to these tweets that provide information about where to get tested or how to obtain PrEP may be potential approaches to reduce HIV incidence."
12,2019,35948944,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"Introduction: Cervical cancer (CC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death among women in sub-Saharan Africa. It occurs most frequently in women living with HIV (WLHIV) and is classified as an AIDS-defining illness. Recent World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations provide guidance for CC prevention policies, with specifications for WLHIV. We systematically reviewed policies for CC prevention and control in sub-Saharan countries with the highest HIV prevalence. Methods: We included countries with an HIV prevalence ≥ 10% in 2018 and policies published between January 1<sup>st</sup> 2010 and March 31<sup>st</sup> 2022. We searched Medline via PubMed, the international cancer control partnership website and national governmental websites of included countries for relevant policy documents. The online document search was supplemented with expert consultation for each included country. We synthesised aspects defined in policies for HPV vaccination, sex education, condom use, tobacco control, male circumcision,cervical screening, diagnosis and treatment of cervical pre-cancerous lesions and cancer, monitoring mechanisms and cost of services to women while highlighting specificities for WLHIV. Results: We reviewed 33 policy documents from nine countries. All included countries had policies on CC prevention and control either as a standalone policy (77.8%), or as part of a cancer or non-communicable diseases policy (22.2%) or both (66.7%). Aspects of HPV vaccination were reported in 7 (77.8%) of the 9 countries. All countries (100%) planned to develop or review Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials for CC prevention including condom use and tobacco control. Age at screening commencement and screening intervals for WLHIV varied across countries. The most common recommended screening and treatment methods were visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) (88.9%), Pap smear (77.8%); cryotherapy (100%) and loop electrosurgical procedure (LEEP) (88.9%) respectively. Global indicators disaggregated by HIV status for monitoring CC programs were rarely reported. CC prevention and care policies included service costs at various stages in three countries (33.3%). Conclusion: Considerable progress has been made in policy development for CC prevention and control in sub Saharan Africa. However, in countries with a high HIV burden, there is need to tailor these policies to respond to the specific needs of WLHIV. Countries may consider updating policies using the recent WHO guidelines for CC prevention, while adapting them to context realities."
12,2019,35901094,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"Despite extensive global efforts, sub-Saharan Africa remains disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. This generalized epidemic can be seen in Lesotho which in 2014 the HIV prevalence rate of those aged 15-49 years was 24.6%, with and incidence of 1.9 new infections per 100-person-year exposures. To better understand the impact of Lesotho's national HIV response and significant predictors associated with HIV infection, the Lesotho Population-based HIV Impact Assessment was conducted. This survey provided a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 15-59 years old in which participants were tested for HIV and given an individual questionnaire that included socio-demographic and behavioral risk questions. The association of factors between survey questions and HIV incident was assessed using logistic regression. Multivariate logistic regression models for men and women were constructed for each outcome using variables known to be or plausibly associated with recent or chronic infection. Overall annualized incidence among people aged 15-49 was 1.19% (95% CI 0.73-1.65) per year. The overall prevalence of HIV was 25.6% with women having significantly higher prevalence. Multiple variables, including decreased wealth status, lower education levels, marital status, condom use at first sex, and circumcision (men only) were identified as being significantly associated with HIV infection for both men and women. In combination with improving the awareness of HIV status, an increased focus is needed on AGYW and men 35-49 years old to prevent new infections. HIV education and prevention programs should focus heavily on younger age groups prior to and soon after sexual debut to prevent HIV transmission. The findings of the survey showed significant room for improvement in increasing awareness of HIV status and reinforcing the need for continued HIV prevention and treatment efforts in Lesotho to prevent new infections."
12,2019,35900708,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"A well-documented barrier to voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is financial loss due to the missed opportunity to work while undergoing and recovering from VMMC. We implemented a 2-phased outcome evaluation to explore how enhanced demand creation and financial compensation equivalent to 3 days of missed work influence uptake of VMMC among men at high risk of HIV exposure in Zambia. In Phase 1, we implemented human-centered design-informed interpersonal communication. In Phase 2, financial compensation of ZMW 200 (~ US$17) was added. The proportion of men undergoing circumcision was significantly higher in Phase 2 compared to Phase 1 (38% vs 3%). The cost of demand creation and compensation per client circumcised was $151.54 in Phase 1 and $34.93 in Phase 2. Financial compensation is a cost-effective strategy for increasing VMMC uptake among high-risk men in Zambia, and VMMC programs may consider similar interventions suited to their context."
12,2019,35865819,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"Background: Penile microbiome composition has been associated with HSV-2 and HIV in men and with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and HSV-2 in female sex partners. This study sought to 1) characterize penile microbiome composition over a 1-year period and 2) identify factors associated with penile microbiome composition over time. Methods: This prospective study of community-recruited heterosexual couples in Kenya measured penile and vaginal microbiomes via 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing at 4 time points over 1 year (1, 6, and 12 months after baseline). We used longitudinal mixed-effects modeling to assess associated demographic, behavioral, and disease factors and changes in community type, meatal taxa with the highest mean relative abundance, and alpha and beta diversity measures. We estimated group-based trajectories to elucidate compositional trends. Results: Among 218 men with 740 observations, men had a median age of 26 years, 11.6% were living with HIV, and 46.1% were HSV-2 seropositive. We identified 7 penile community types that varied with circumcision status, female partner vaginal microbiome community state type (CST), condom use, and penile washing. Across varying analytic approaches, 50%-60% of men had stable penile microbiome compositions. Alpha diversity measures were lower for circumcised men and those who reported condom use; they were stable over time but higher if female partners had diverse CSTs or BV. BV was positively associated with the relative abundance of numerous individual penile taxa. The decreased Bray-Curtis similarity was more common for men with HSV-2, and HSV-2 was also associated with a lower relative abundance of Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus . Conclusions: Over a 1-year period, penile microbiome composition was stable for a substantial proportion of men and was influenced by men's circumcision status, sexual practices, female partner's vaginal CST and BV status, and men's HSV-2 status. In the female genital tract, a diverse CST is often associated with poorer health outcomes. Our results contribute toward understanding whether this framework extends to the penile microbiome and whether diversity and the associated penile microbiome compositions influence susceptibility or resilience to poorer health outcomes in men. Focusing on understanding how these factors influence the penile microbiome may lead to therapeutic avenues for reduced HSV-2 and BV infections in men and their female sex partners."
12,2019,35805784,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"South Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV worldwide. South Africa has implemented five population-based HIV prevalence surveys since 2002 aimed at understanding the dynamics and the trends of the epidemic. This paper presents key findings from the fifth HIV prevalence, incidence, and behaviour survey conducted in 2017 following policy, programme, and epidemic change since the prior survey was conducted in 2012. A cross-sectional population-based household survey collected behavioural and biomedical data on all members of the eligible households. A total of 39,132 respondents from 11,776 households were eligible to participate, of whom 93.6% agreed to be interviewed, and 61.1% provided blood specimens. The provided blood specimens were used to determine HIV status, HIV incidence, viral load, exposure to antiretroviral treatment, and HIV drug resistance. Overall HIV incidence among persons aged 2 years and above was 0.48% which translates to an estimated 231,000 new infections in 2017. HIV prevalence was 14.0% translating to 7.9 million people living with HIV. Antiretroviral (ARV) exposure was 62.3%, with the lowest exposure among those aged 15 to 24 years (39.9%) with 10% lower ARV coverage among males compared to females. Viral suppression among those on treatment was high (87.3%), whilst HIV population viral load suppression was much lower (62.3%). In terms of risk behaviours, 13.6% of youth reported having had an early sexual debut (first sex before the age of 15 years), with more males reporting having done so (19.5%) than females (7.6%). Age-disparate relationships, defined as having a sexual partner 5+ years different from oneself,) among adolescents were more common among females (35.8%) than males (1.5%). Self-reported multiple sexual partnerships (MSPs), defined as having more than one sexual partner in the previous 12 months, were more commonly reported by males (25.5%) than females (9.0%). Condom use at last sexual encounter was highest among males than females. Three quarters (75.2%) of people reported they had ever been tested for HIV, with more females (79.3%) having had done so than males (70.9%). Two-thirds of respondents (66.8%) self-reported having tested for HIV in the past 12 months. Finally, 61.6% of males in the survey self-reported as having been circumcised, with circumcision being more common among youth aged 15-24 years (70.2%), Black Africans (68.9%), and those living in both rural informal (tribal) areas (65%) and urban areas (61.9%). Slightly more (51.2%) male circumcisions were reported to have occurred in a medical setting than in traditional settings (44.8%), with more young males aged 15-24 (62.6%) and men aged 25-49 (51.5%) reporting to have done so compared to most men aged 50 and older (57.1%) who reported that they had undergone circumcision in a traditional setting. The results of this survey show that strides have been made in controlling the HIV epidemic, especially in the reduction of HIV incidence, HIV testing, and treatment. Although condom use at last sex act remains unchanged, there continue to be some challenges with the lack of significant behaviour change as people, especially youth, continue to engage in risky behaviour and delay treatment initiation. Therefore, there is a need to develop or scale up targeted intervention programmes to increase HIV testing further and put more people living with HIV on treatment as well as prevent risky behaviours that put young people at risk of HIV infection."
12,2019,35766575,Is male circumcision helpful in reducing heterosexual men's chances of getting HIV?,circumcision hiv,1.0,"Objectives: To understand the impact of United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR's) DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-Free, Mentored, and Safe) Partnership on new HIV diagnoses among women in antenatal care (ANC) settings in 10 African countries from 2015 to 2020. Design: We modeled spatiotemporal changes in new HIV diagnoses among women in ANC settings using PEPFAR data. Statistical tests were performed in R to compare differences in new diagnoses rates between DREAMS and non-DREAMS subnational units (SNUs) and to explore predictors of new diagnoses declines within DREAMS SNUs. Methods: We used a predictive geospatial model to forecast the rate of new diagnoses for each time period in a 5 km grid cell (n = 861 SNUs). Linear model analyses were conducted using predictor variables: urbanicity, DREAMS geographic footprint, 'layering' proxy, and community-level male viral load suppression. Results: New HIV diagnoses in ANC from 2015 to 2020 declined in nearly all SNUs. 'Always' DREAMS SNUs reported declines of 45% while 'Never' DREAMS SNUs reported a decline of only 37% (F = 8.1, 1 and 829 DF, P 0.01). Within Always DREAMS SNUs, greater declines were seen in areas with a higher number of minimum services in their DREAMS primary package (t = 2.77, P 0.01). Conclusion: New HIV diagnoses among women are declining in both DREAMS and non-DREAMS SNUs; mirroring HIV incidence decreases and reflecting increasing community viral load suppression and voluntary male medical circumcision rates. DREAMS programming may have contributed to accelerated declines of new HIV diagnoses in DREAMS SNUs compared with non-DREAMS SNUs. Increased progress is needed to further reduce the disparities between adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) and young men to achieve epidemic control."

The use of a physical method, assuming the possibility of its action on increasing the concentration of serotonin, may be the direction of therapy limiting the number of antidepressants used. The aim of the research was to study the effects of low-frequency magnetic fields of different characteristics on the circadian profile of serotonin in men with low back pain. (2) Methods: 16 men with back pain syndrome participated in the study. The patients were divided into two groups. In group 1, magnetotherapy (2.9 mT, 40 Hz, square wave, bipolar) was applied at 10.00 a.m. In group 2, the M2P2 magnetic stimulation program of the Viofor JPS device was used. Treatments in each group lasted 3 weeks, 5 days each, with breaks for Saturday and Sunday. The daily serotonin profile was determined the day before the exposure and the day after the last treatment. Blood samples (at night with red light) were collected at 8:00, 12:00, 16:00, 24:00, and 4:00. The patients did not suffer from any chronic or acute disease and were not taking any medications. (3) Results: In group 1, a significant increase in serotonin concentration was observed after 15 treatments at 4:00. In group 2, a significant increase in serotonin concentration was observed at 8:00 after the end of the treatments. In comparison between magnetotherapy and magnetic stimulation, the time points at which differences appeared after the application of serotonin occurred due to the increase in its concentrations after the application of magnetic stimulation. (4) Conclusions: Magnetotherapy and magnetic stimulation, acting in a similar way, increase the concentration of serotonin. Weak magnetic fields work similarly to the stronger ones used in TMS. It is possible to use them in the treatment of mental disorders or other diseases with low serotonin concentrations."

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists prevent adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and also reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Most older adults (mean age, 75 years) with prediabetes do not progress to diabetes. Among patients in this age group with type 2 diabetes treated with medication, an A1C level of less than 7% is associated with increased risk of hospitalization for hypoglycemia, especially when using a sulfonylurea or insulin. For patients with chronic low back pain, exercise, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, duloxetine, and opioids were shown to be more effective than control in achieving a 30% reduction in pain, but self-discontinuation of duloxetine and opioids was common. There is no clinically important difference between muscle relaxants and placebo in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain. In patients with chronic pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports exercise, yoga, massage, and mindfulness-based stress reduction. For acute musculoskeletal pain, acetaminophen, 1,000 mg, plus ibuprofen, 400 mg, without an opioid is a good option. Regarding screening for colorectal cancer, trial evidence supports performing fecal immunochemical testing every other year. For chronic constipation, evidence supports polyethylene glycol, senna, fiber supplements, magnesium-based products, and fruit-based products. The following abdominal symptoms carry a greater than 3% risk of cancer or inflammatory bowel disease: dysphagia or change in bowel habits in men; rectal bleeding in women; and abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, or dyspepsia in men and women older than 60 years. For secondary prevention in those with established arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 81 mg of aspirin daily appears to be effective. The Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations both overestimate the risk of cardiovascular events. Over 12 years, no association between egg consumption and cardiovascular events was demonstrated. Gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and venlafaxine provide clinically meaningful improvements in chronic neuropathic pain. In patients with moderate to severe depression, initial titration above the minimum starting dose of antidepressants in the first eight weeks of treatment is not more likely to increase response. In adults with iron deficiency anemia, adding vitamin C to oral iron has no effect. In children with pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis, or acute otitis media, providing education combined with a take-and-hold antibiotic prescription results in 1 in 4 of those children eventually taking an antibiotic."

While medications play an important role in pain management, their use has limitations in geriatric patients due to reduced liver and renal function, comorbid medical problems, and polypharmacy. This review will assess the evidence basis for medications used for spine-related pain in older adults, with a focus on drug metabolism and adverse drug reactions. A PubMed/OVID search crossing common spine, neck, and back pain terms with key words for older adults and geriatrics was combined with common drug classes and common drug names and limited to clinical trials and age over 65 years. The results were then reviewed with identification of commonly used drugs and drug categories: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, corticosteroids, gabapentin and pregabalin, antispastic and antispasmodic muscle relaxants, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tramadol, and opioids. Collectively, 138 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were the focus of the review. The review found a variable contribution of high-quality studies examining the efficacy of medications for spine pain primarily in the geriatric population. There was strong evidence for NSAID use with adjustments for gastrointestinal and renal risk factors. Gabapentin and pregabalin had mixed evidence for neuropathic pain. SNRIs had good evidence for neuropathic pain and a more favorable safety profile than TCAs. Tramadol had some evidence in older patients, but more so in persons aged 65 years. Rational therapeutic choices based on geriatric spine pain diagnosis are helpful, such as NSAIDs and acetaminophen for arthritic and myofascial-based pain, gabapentinoids or duloxetine for neuropathic and radicular pain, antispastic agents for myofascial-based pain, and combination therapy for mixed etiologies. Tramadol can be well tolerated in older patients, but has risks of cognitive and classic opioid side effects. Otherwise, opioids are typically avoided in the treatment of spine-related pain in older adults due to their morbidity and mortality risk and are reserved for refractory severe pain. Whenever possible, beneficial geriatric spine pain pharmacotherapy should employ the lowest therapeutic doses with consideration of polypharmacy, potentially decreased renal and hepatic metabolism, and co-morbid medical disorders."

New evidence on the effects and safety of paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and antidepressants for LBP warrants an updated overview for musculoskeletal clinicians on this topic. Clinical question: How effective and safe are paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and antidepressants compared with placebo for treating LBP? Key results: For acute LBP ( 12 weeks), muscle relaxants and NSAIDs may be superior to placebo for reducing pain, but the effects of opioids, antibiotics, and antidepressants are unknown. Paracetamol provides no additional benefit for acute LBP. For chronic LBP (&gt;12 weeks), NSAIDs, antidepressants, and opioids may be superior to placebo for reducing pain, but opioids have an established profile of harms. Antibiotics may also reduce pain for people with chronic LBP with Modic type 1 changes, although the risks may outweigh their benefits. The effects of paracetamol and muscle relaxants for chronic LBP were unclear. Clinical application: NSAIDs may have a role in managing acute and chronic LBP, with cautious use in people who may be at greater risk of experiencing adverse events. Paracetamol, opioid analgesics, antibiotics, muscle relaxants, and antidepressants should only be prescribed following a discussion between the treating clinician and the patient, considering the risks and possible benefits, and after or in conjunction with recommended nonpharmacological strategies for improving LBP.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Review, Index to Chiropractic Literature, AMED, CINAHL, and PEDro to identify CPGs that described the management of mechanical LBP in the prior five years. Two investigators independently screened titles and abstracts and potentially relevant full text were considered for eligibility. Four investigators independently applied the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument for critical appraisal. Data were extracted for pharmaceutical intervention, the strength of recommendation, and appropriateness for the duration of LBP. Results: 316 citations were identified, 50 full-text articles were assessed, and nine guidelines with global representation met the eligibility criteria. These CPGs addressed pharmacological treatments with or without non-pharmacological treatments. All CPGS focused on the management of acute, chronic, or unspecified duration of LBP. The mean overall AGREE II score was 89.3% (SD 3.5%). The lowest domain mean score was for applicability, 80.4% (SD 5.2%), and the highest was Scope and Purpose, 94.0% (SD 2.4%). There were ten classifications of medications described in the included CPGs: acetaminophen, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, oral corticosteroids, skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs), and atypical opioids. Conclusions: Nine CPGs, included ten medication classes for the management of LBP. NSAIDs were the most frequently recommended medication for the treatment of both acute and chronic LBP as a first line pharmacological therapy. Acetaminophen and SMRs were inconsistently recommended for acute LBP. Meanwhile, with less consensus among CPGs, acetaminophen and antidepressants were proposed as second-choice therapies for chronic LBP. There was significant heterogeneity of recommendations within many medication classes, although oral corticosteroids, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and antibiotics were not recommended by any CPGs for acute or chronic LBP."

We used nationally-representative data from the Medical Expenditure Health Survey, 2014 to 2018 to examine trends in prescriptions for opioid and non-opioid pain medications, including acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, gabapentinoids, and antidepressants among U.S. adults with self-reported pain. Overall, from 2014 to 2018, the percentage of participants receiving a prescription for opioids declined, (38.8% vs 32.8%), remained stable for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (26.8% vs 27.7%), and increased for acetaminophen (1.6% vs 2.3%), antidepressants (9.6% vs 12.0%) and gabapentinoids (13.2% vs 19.0%). In this period, the adjusted odds of receiving an opioid prescription decreased (aOR = .93, 95% CI = .90-.96), while the adjusted odds of receiving antidepressant, gabapentinoid and acetaminophen prescriptions increased (antidepressants: aOR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.03-1.13 gabapentinoids: aOR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06-1.17; acetaminophen: aOR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.20). Secondary analyses stratifiying within the 2014 to 2016 and 2016 to 2018 periods revealed particular increases in prescriptions for gabapentinoids (aOR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.05-1.21) and antidepressants (aOR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.12-1.35) since 2016. PERSPECTIVE: These data demonstrate that physicians are increasingly turning to CDC-recommended non-opioid medications for pain management, particularly antidepressants and gabapentinoids. However, evidence for these medications' efficacy in treating numerous common pain conditions, including low back pain, remains limited."

Ambulatory care currently does not provide a structured multimodal approach, even though multimodal therapy is recommended. Objectives: The goal was to explore utilization of ambulatory health care resources concerning a multimodal therapy approach in the first year of CLBP and determine user types. Materials and methods: A two-step cluster analysis was executed with administrative data of 11,182 incident cases. The age was between 18 and 65 years and data of four consecutively quarters per patient were analyzed. With the administrative data from orthopedics, pain therapy, psychotherapy, exercise therapy, analgesics and opioids, clusters were determined. Further results were provided by variables of patients and the structure of care. Results: The analysis reveals four user types: 39.7% used no specialist care and less exercise therapy; 37.3% used orthopedics; 15.6% used orthopedics and pain therapy; and 7.4% used orthopedics, pain therapy and/or psychotherapy. Characteristics for multimodal utilization were the following: female, high use of analgesics (m = 143.94 DDD), high use of opioids (m = 37.12 DDD), high costs of exercise therapy (m = 631.79 €), acupuncture, antidepressants, hospitalization, interdisciplinary case conference, and consult neurologists. In all, 60.4% of the study population received analgesics. Conclusions: The cluster analysis indicated differential user types.

The objective of this review is to summarize and evaluate the safety profiles of different pharmacological treatment options used in the management of CLBP. Areas covered : The authors conducted a search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the safety profiles of different pharmacological agents used in the management of CLBP. This narrative review covered corticosteroids, opioids, antidepressants, gabapentinoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, anti-nerve growth factor antibodies and topical agents, as monotherapy or in combination. Expert opinion : The risk-benefit ratio of a particular treatment is a subject driving the ongoing development of pharmaceuticals. The most commonly reported AEs across all drug classes are of gastrointestinal nature, followed by neurological and skin-related. These AEs include nausea, dizziness, constipation, arthralgia, headache, dry mouth, pruritus, etc. The majority of the AEs reported are not life-threatening, although they may lower patients' quality of life, thus, affecting their compliance. One of the biggest limitations of our review stems from the paucity of safety assessments in published RCTs. Advances in our understanding of the neurobiology of pain will promote development of new therapeutic strategies."

We developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on nonsurgical management of patients with LSS causing NC. Using the GRADE approach, a multidisciplinary guidelines panel based recommendations on evidence from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews published through June 2019, or expert consensus. The literature monitored up to October 2020. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, disability, quality of life, and walking capacity. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with LSS (congenital and/or acquired, lateral recess or central canal, with or without low back pain, with or without spondylolisthesis) causing NC. The guidelines panel developed 6 recommendations based on randomized controlled trials and 5 others based on professional consensus, summarized in 3 overarching recommendations: (Grade: statements are all conditional/weak recommendations) Recommendation 1. For patients with LSS causing NC, clinicians and patients may initially select multimodal care nonpharmacological therapies with education, advice and lifestyle changes, behavioral change techniques in conjunction with home exercise, manual therapy, and/or rehabilitation (moderate-quality evidence), traditional acupuncture on a trial basis (very low-quality evidence), and postoperative rehabilitation (supervised program of exercises and/or educational materials encouraging activity) with cognitive-behavioral therapy 12 weeks postsurgery (low-quality evidence). Recommendation 2. In patients LSS causing NC, clinicians and patients may consider a trial of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. (very low-quality evidence). Recommendation 3. For patients LSS causing NC, we recommend against the use of the following pharmacological therapies: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, methylcobalamin, calcitonin, paracetamol, opioids, muscle relaxants, pregabalin (consensus-based), gabapentin (very low-quality), and epidural steroidal injections (high-quality evidence). PERSPECTIVE: This guideline, on the basis of a systematic review of the evidence on the nonsurgical management of lumbar spine stenosis, provides recommendations developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Safe and effective non-surgical management of lumbar spine stenosis should be on the basis of a plan of care tailored to the individual and the type of treatment involved, and multimodal care is recommended in most situations."

The efficacy, acceptability, and safety of antidepressant medicines for low back pain (LBP) are not clear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of antidepressant medicines for LBP. Methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov , the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform from inception to May 2020. We included published and trial registry reports of RCTs that allocated adult participants with LBP to receive an antidepressant medicine or a placebo medicine. Pairs of authors independently extracted data in duplicate. We extracted participant characteristics, study sample size, outcome values, and measures of variance for each outcome. We data using random-effects meta-analysis models and calculated estimates of effects and heterogeneity for each outcome. We formed judgments of confidence in the evidence in accordance with GRADE. We report our findings in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We prespecified all outcomes in a prospectively registered protocol. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and acceptability. We measured pain intensity at end-of-treatment on a 0-100 point scale and considered 10 points the minimal clinically important difference. We defined acceptability as the odds of stopping treatment for any reason. Results: We included 23 RCTs in this review. Data were available for pain in 17 trials and acceptability in 14 trials. Treatment with antidepressants decreased pain intensity by 4.33 points (95% CI - 6.15 to - 2.50) on a 0-100 scale, compared to placebo. Treatment with antidepressants increased the odds of stopping treatment for any reason (OR 1.27 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.56]), compared to placebo. Conclusions: Treatment of LBP with antidepressants is associated with small reductions in pain intensity and increased odds of stopping treatment for any reason, compared to placebo. The effect on pain is not clinically important. The effect on acceptability warrants consideration. These findings provide Level I evidence to guide clinicians in their use of antidepressants to treat LBP.

Previous research has suggested a significant decrease in carnitine levels in patients with kidney failure and those undergoing hemodialysis. Therefore, we designed this study to assess the prevalence and characteristics of carnitine deficiency and its association with hemodialysis complications in the pediatric population. Methods: This research was a pilot study of 29 children undergoing hemodialysis. Before hemodialysis, a 5-mL blood sample was drawn from each patient through a peripheral vein to measure serum-free carnitine levels, complete blood count with differential, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and electrolytes. Each patient was observed for intradialytic complications, including muscle cramps and hypotension, during 12 sessions of hemodialysis. Results: We included 26 participants with a mean age of 14.23 years undergoing hemodialysis. Carnitine deficiency was revealed in 54.8% of our participants. Also, there was no significant correlation between carnitine deficiency and age, gender, and BUN levels (P = 0.698, P = 0.43, and P &gt; 0.05, respectively). Intradialytic complications, including episodes of hypotension and muscle cramps, were more frequent in patients with carnitine deficiency (P = 0.02, P = 0.01, respectively). Other reasons for muscle cramps, such as fluid overload, nutritional status, dialysis regimen, and other important lab results (phosphorus, magnesium, etc.), were ruled out. Conclusion: In conclusion, we found a higher prevalence of carnitine deficiency in pediatric hemodialysis patients. Carnitine deficiency was significantly associated with increased intradialytic symptoms, including muscle spasms and hypotension. Our results could support a potential role of carnitine supplementation in pediatric patients with kidney failure for controlling intradialytic complications, but this requires further investigation.

16,2019,34844641,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"Background: Leg cramps are painful sensations of tightening in the muscles of the legs that commonly appear during the night and are often associated with secondary insomnia. They are common especially in older age. There is no evidence that any method of prevention of nocturnal leg cramps is both safe and effective. There are no previous trials concerning cramp prevention by using compression stockings. The objective of this study is to assess in a prospective randomised controlled trial whether leg cramps can be prevented by the daily use of knee-length compression stockings or magnesium supplements. Methods: The study will be set in Finland, and 50-84-year-old volunteers will be recruited through Google Ads, the Finnish health library website and Finnish primary health care centres. The participants must have a minimum of two episodes of leg cramps per week for the past 4 weeks to be included in the study. The participants (n = 225) will be allocated to three equal groups: the compression stocking arm, the magnesium supplement arm and the placebo arm. The participants will go through 4 weeks of follow-up without intervention and then another 4 weeks of follow-up with the assigned intervention. The material for the study will be collected through electronic questionnaires. Discussion: This protocol describes a study that compares compression stockings, magnesium supplements and placebo for the prevention of leg cramps. The results of this study can significantly improve knowledge on the methods of preventing leg cramps.

16,2019,33906702,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"Magnesium (Mg2+) plays an essential role in many biological processes. Mg2+ deficiency is therefore associated with a wide range of clinical effects including muscle cramps, fatigue, seizures and arrhythmias. To maintain sufficient Mg2+ levels, (re)absorption of Mg2+ in the intestine and kidney is tightly regulated. Genetic defects that disturb Mg2+ uptake pathways, as well as drugs interfering with Mg2+ (re)absorption cause hypomagnesemia. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic and drug-induced Mg2+ deficiencies. This leads to the identification of four main mechanisms that are affected by hypomagnesemia-causing mutations or drugs: luminal transient receptor potential melastatin type 6/7-mediated Mg2+ uptake, paracellular Mg2+ reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, structural integrity of the distal convoluted tubule and Na+-dependent Mg2+ extrusion driven by the Na+/K+-ATPase. Our analysis demonstrates that genetic and drug-induced causes of hypomagnesemia share common molecular mechanisms. Targeting these shared pathways can lead to novel treatment options for patients with hypomagnesemia."

16,2019,32956536,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"Background: Skeletal muscle cramps are common and often occur in association with pregnancy, advanced age, exercise or motor neuron disorders (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Typically, such cramps have no obvious underlying pathology, and so are termed idiopathic. Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps but the efficacy of magnesium for this purpose remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012, and performed to identify and incorporate more recent studies. Objectives: To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation compared to no treatment, placebo control or other cramp therapies in people with skeletal muscle cramps. SEARCH METHODS: On 9 September 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and SPORTDiscus. We also searched WHO-ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov for registered trials that might be ongoing or unpublished, and ISI Web of Science for studies citing the studies included in this review. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of magnesium supplementation (in any form) to prevent skeletal muscle cramps in any patient group (i.e. all clinical presentations of cramp). We considered comparisons of magnesium with no treatment, placebo control, or other therapy. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Two review authors assessed risk of bias. We attempted to contact all study authors when questions arose and obtained participant-level data for four of the included trials, one of which was unpublished. We collected all data on adverse effects from the included RCTs. Main results: We identified 11 trials (nine parallel-group, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 735 individuals, amongst whom 118 cross-over participants additionally served as their own controls. Five trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps (408 participants) and five trials enrolled people with idiopathic cramps (271 participants, with 118 additionally crossed over to control). Another study enrolled 29 people with liver cirrhosis, only some of whom suffered muscle cramps. All trials provided magnesium as an oral supplement, except for one trial which provided magnesium as a series of slow intravenous infusions. Nine trials compared magnesium to placebo, one trial compared magnesium to no treatment, calcium carbonate or vitamin B, and another trial compared magnesium to vitamin E or calcium. We judged the single trial in people with liver cirrhosis and all five trials in participants with pregnancy-associated leg cramps to be at high risk of bias. In contrast, we rated the risk of bias high in only one of five trials in participants with idiopathic rest cramps. For idiopathic cramps, largely in older adults (mean age 61.6 to 69.3 years) presumed to have nocturnal leg cramps (the commonest presentation), differences in measures of cramp frequency when comparing magnesium to placebo were small, not statistically significant, and showed minimal heterogeneity (I² = 0% to 12%). This includes the primary endpoint, percentage change from baseline in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (mean difference (MD) -9.59%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -23.14% to 3.97%; 3 studies, 177 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the difference in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (MD -0.18 cramps/week, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.49; 5 studies, 307 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 3 studies, 177 participants; high-certainty evidence). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found at four weeks in measures of cramp intensity or cramp duration. This includes the number of participants rating their cramps as moderate or severe at four weeks (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.21; 2 studies, 91 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and the percentage of participants with the majority of cramp durations of one minute or more at four weeks (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.53, 1 study, 46 participants; low-certainty evidence). We were unable to perform meta-analysis for trials of pregnancy-associated leg cramps. The single study comparing magnesium to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a three-point ordinal scale of overall treatment efficacy. Of the three trials comparing magnesium to placebo, one found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures, another found benefit for both, and a third reported inconsistent results for frequency that could not be reconciled. The single study in people with liver cirrhosis was small and had limited reporting of cramps, but found no difference in terms of cramp frequency or cramp intensity. Our analysis of adverse events pooled all studies, regardless of the setting in which cramps occurred. Major adverse events (occurring in 2 out of 72 magnesium recipients and 3 out of 68 placebo recipients), and withdrawals due to adverse events, were not significantly different from placebo. However, in the four studies for which it could be determined, more participants experienced minor adverse events in the magnesium group than in the placebo group (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.33; 4 studies, 254 participants; low-certainty evidence). Overall, oral magnesium was associated with mostly gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g. diarrhoea), experienced by 11% (10% in control) to 37% (14% in control) of participants. Authors' conclusions: It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this population is needed. We found no RCTs evaluating magnesium for exercise-associated muscle cramps or disease-state-associated muscle cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease) other than a single small (inconclusive) study in people with liver cirrhosis, only some of whom suffered cramps."

Methods: The frequency and duration of cramp and serum electrolytes were evaluated in 81 patients with MG. The patients were classified using Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America postintervention status scores based on the treatment and the responsiveness to the treatment. Quantitative MG score, MG activities of daily living score, MG composite score, or MG quality of life 15 score was used to assess the health-related quality of life (QOL). Results: Muscle cramps developed in 44 (54.3%) of 81 MG patients. The scores of MG activities of daily living, MG composite, or MG-QOL 15-item questionnaire in patients with cramp were significantly higher than those in patients without cramps (P = 0.002, P = 0.01, or P = 0.0022, respectively). The serum magnesium concentrations were lower in patients treated with CNI (n = 16) than in those not treated with CNI (n = 65) (P = 0.002). The probability of cramps was significantly higher in patients treated with ChEIs (≥180 mg/d) in addition to CNI than in patients who were treated with a low dose of ChEIs (≤60 mg/d) without concomitant CNI treatment (P = 0.017). Conclusions: Our data suggested that treatment with a high dose of ChEI and CNI accelerated the probability of cramps and reduced the QOL in MG patients."

In 2009, a KCNA1 mutation was identified in a large family with autosomal dominant hypomagnesemia. Despite efforts in establishing a genotype-phenotype correlation for the wide variety of symptoms in EA1, little is known on the serum magnesium (Mg2+) levels in these patients. In the present study, we describe a new de novo KCNA1 mutation in a Polish patient with tetany and hypomagnesemia. Electrophysiological and biochemical analyses were performed to determine the pathogenicity of the mutation. A female patient presented with low serum Mg2+ levels, renal Mg2+ wasting, muscle cramps, and tetanic episodes. Whole exome sequencing identified a p.Leu328Val mutation in KCNA1 encoding the Kv1.1 K+ channel. Electrophysiological examinations demonstrated that the p.Leu328Val mutation caused a dominant-negative loss of function of the encoded Kv1.1 channel. Cell surface biotinylation showed normal plasma membrane expression. Taken together, this is the second report linking KCNA1 with hypomagnesemia, thereby emphasizing the need for further evaluation of the clinical phenotypes observed in patients carrying KCNA1 mutations."
16,2019,28886613,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"We report about an acute monkshood intoxication requiring acute resuscitation in suicidal intent in a 56-year-old patient. The Blue Monkshood (Aconitum napellus) is considered to be the most toxic plant in Europe. All plant parts contain the highly toxic alkonoid aconitin. The lethal dose in adults is 2 - 6 mg. Intoxications are often fatal. Asymptomatic patients with suspected monkshood intoxication should also be monitored on an ICU. First signs of intoxication are paraesthesia in the mouth and throat area, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting and severe pain in skeletal muscle. Affected patients die within hours after ingestion due to respiratory distress and/or cardiac arrhythmia.The most important measure after oral ingestion is to achieve a rapid primary poison elimination clearance (in the case of awareness clear patients, trigger vomiting, otherwise gastric lavage under protective intubation) and the subsequent carbonation. A specific antidote is not available. The management of an intoxication consists primarily of the therapy of the rhythm disturbances in the form of magnesium and amiodarone.Strict adherence to protective measures (gloves, masks) must be strictly observed. A direct skin contact with plant parts is to be avoided as well as the potential contact with vomit or aspirate."
16,2019,28019093,Can magnesium prevent muscle cramps?,magnesium muscle cramps,0.0,"Creatine is a popular ergogenic supplement in sports nutrition. Yet, supplementation of creatine occasionally caused adverse effects such as gastrointestinal complaints, muscle cramps and an increase in body weight. Creatine monohydrate has already been evaluated by different competent authorities and several have come to the conclusion that a daily intake of 3 g creatine per person is unlikely to pose safety concerns, focusing on healthy adults with exclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women. Possible vulnerable subgroups were also discussed in relation to the safety of creatine. The present review provides an up-to-date overview of the relevant information with special focus on human studies regarding the safety of creatine monohydrate and other marketed creatine forms, in particular creatine pyruvate, creatine citrate, creatine malate, creatine taurinate, creatine phosphate, creatine orotate, creatine ethyl ester, creatine pyroglutamate, creatine gluconate, and magnesium creatine chelate. Limited data are available with regard to the safety of the latter creatine forms. Considering an acceptable creatine intake of 3 g per day, most of the evaluated creatine forms are unlikely to pose safety concerns, however some safety concerns regarding a supplementary intake of creatine orotate, creatine phosphate, and magnesium creatine chelate are discussed here."

In this case, after a patient's three-month history of lower back pain and rapidly progressing leg numbness and weakness, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass in the third lumbar vertebra. At a two-month follow-up, imaging showed a fracture, compression and lesion enlargement. Decompression and fixation confirmed ES, and the patient began combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Two months postoperatively, residual ES was suspected on MRI. The patient underwent a second surgery, and histopathology confirmed necrosis. A six-month follow-up after the first surgery showed no tumor recurrence. This case supports the inclusion of ES in the differential diagnosis of pathologic spinal fracture. Early decompression and spinal fixation are critical for preserving neurologic and spinal functions in ES complicated by a compression fracture. Combined adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain the standard therapeutic strategy."

A 72-year-old male patient presented with low back pain and right lower leg numbness for 12 months. A review of full-spine X-ray and lumbar MRI revealed moderate spondylosis at L2-5, moderate lumbar scoliosis, and a 7.15 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Given the minimum 2-weeks of referral waiting time to receive treatment for AAA, the patient received chiropractic treatment with a hybrid rehabilitation to address the disc herniation causing severe physical disability. Through the treatments, the patient's pain was significantly alleviated with careful consideration of potential risk factors associated with AAA. In addition, the acute disc herniation was successfully managed by a series of chiropractic treatments before and after the operation for AAA. This case supports that low back pain in patients with AAA can be managed by manual therapy, in contrast to a widespread belief that manual therapy is contraindicated in AAA. More case reports of AAA patients with low back pain are warranted to assess the effectiveness and safety of manual therapy along with surgical treatment for AAA."
17,2019,34864904,Can lumbar supports treat or prevent lower back pain?,lumbar supports lower back pain,0.0,"The leg press is a resistance training (RT) exercise common to both weight- and powerlifting, where spine-related injuries remain prevalent. Here, the elevated loading has the potential to result in increased pressure on vertebral bodies and introduce the risk of spinal injury. This study, therefore, investigates back interfacial pressure under leg press loading conditions and offers design recommendations to minimize spatial pressure concentrations. A pressure mat was used to assess the back-backrest interfacial pressure distribution of 15 subjects executing RT leg-presses at 50% body weight, over 16 different back-support geometries. Real-time forces, knee angles, and pressures were captured. The resulting data show that more prominent (≥2.1 cm) back-supports, positioned 19 cm above the seat pan typically produced greater peak pressures (41.8 ± 7.2 kPa). Conversely, less prominent supports (∼0.7 cm) generally achieved lower peak pressures (with greater distribution). Our data suggest that the most prudent choice for fixed-shape backrests to best distribute interfacial pressure on leg-press devices is to incorporate shallow convex supports (∼0.7 cm) and locate them away from P = 19 cm. The result is surprising as this prominence location is a common ergonomic feature. If an adjustable backrest is considered, peak pressures may be reduced by up to 26 ± 8% (9.7 ± 3.1 kPa) compared to flat geometries."
17,2019,33633419,Can lumbar supports treat or prevent lower back pain?,lumbar supports lower back pain,0.0,"Purpose of review: This review presents epidurolysis as a procedure to alleviate pain and disability from epidural adhesions. It reviews novel and groundbreaking evidence, describing the background, indications, benefits and adverse events from this procedure in an effort to provide healthcare experts with the data required to decide on an intervention for their patients. Recent findings: Epidural adhesions (EA) or epidural fibrosis (EF) is defined as non-physiologic scar formation secondary to a local inflammatory reaction provoked by tissue trauma in the epidural space. Often, it is a sequelae of surgical spine intervention or instrumentation. The cost associated with chronic post-operative back pain has been reported to be up to nearly $12,500 dollars per year; this, coupled with the increasing prevalence of chronic lower back pain and the subsequent increase in surgical management of back pain, renders EF a significant cost and morbidity in the U.S. Though risk factors leading to the development of EA are not well established, epidural fibrosis has been reported to be the culprit in up to 46% of cases of Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS), a chronic pain condition found in up to 20-54% of patients who receive back surgery. Moreover, EF has also been associated with lumbar radiculopathy after lumbar disc surgery. Epidurolysis is defined as the mechanical dissolution of epidural fibrotic scar tissue for persistent axial spine or radicular pain due to epidural fibrosis that is refractory to conservative therapy Endoscopic lysis of adhesions is a procedural technique which has been shown to improve chronic back pain in one-third to one-half of patients with clinically symptomatic fibrous adhesions. Here we review some of the novel evidence that supports this procedure in EA and FBSS. Summary: The literature concerning epidurolysis in the management of epidural adhesions is insufficient. Prospective studies, including randomized controlled trials and observational studies, have suggested epidurolysis to be effective in terms of pain reduction, functional improvement, and patient satisfaction scores. Observational studies report epidurolysis as a well-tolerated, safe procedure. Current evidence suggests that epidurolysis may be used as an effective treatment modality for epidural adhesions. Nonetheless, further high quality randomized controlled studies assessing the safety and efficacy of epidurolysis in the management of epidural adhesions is needed."

Clinical care and randomized trials of rehabilitation or surgery for symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication (LSS) are complicated by the lack of standard criteria for diagnosis and outcome measurement. Objective . To evaluate whether manual muscle testing (MMT) can detect transient lower-extremity weakness provoked by walking in patients with likely LSS. Methods . A total of 19 patients with symptoms and MRI findings suggestive of LSS were tested for a decline in lower-extremity strength, using the British Medical Council scale of MMT, by comparing strength at rest to a change in strength within 60 s of completing a 400-foot walk. They were retested after reclining supine for another 2 minutes. This examination was repeated following decompressive lumbar surgery. Results. All patients developed bilateral weakness in the distribution of their LSS, but always including the hip extensors and knee flexors, when tested immediately after the provocative walking test. Most patients were not aware of weakness or change in gait during the walking task. They recovered to baseline strength after resting supine. The patients did not improve with physical therapy. When examined within 8 weeks after decompressive laminectomy, no one developed weakness during the 400-foot walk, and daily lower-extremity pain had resolved. Conclusions . A careful repetitive motor examination can detect transient paraparesis in patients with definite LSS. This finding supports the diagnosis and the functional severity of LSS while providing an objective outcome measurement for physical therapy and surgical interventions that goes beyond symptoms of pain."
17,2019,30260794,Can lumbar supports treat or prevent lower back pain?,lumbar supports lower back pain,0.0,"Background and aims The choice of testing site for quantitative sensory testing (QST) of pain sensitivity is important and previous studies have demonstrated patterns in pain sensitivity within discrete areas in different body regions. Some areas are characterized by a relatively high degree of spatial pain discrimination and recognizable patterns of pain referral, whilst others are not. The lumbar region is likely to have relatively low pain acuity and overlapping of pain referral. The current study was conducted to determine whether patterns of pain sensitivity (detection thresholds) could be identified in the lower back, whether differences in such patterns exist between different groups and whether such patterns could help identify a clinical source of pain and localized increased pain sensitivity. Methods Twenty-one patients with non-specific chronic low back pain and 21 healthy controls were tested for pressure and heat pain thresholds on 30 pre-defined locations over the mid and lower back. Topographical maps of mean pain thresholds and variability were produced, inspected visually and analyzed statistically. Between group differences in pain threshold were analyzed statistically as an indicator of widespread increased pain sensitivity. Evidence of segmental increased pain sensitivity was examined by group statistical comparison of mid-line lower range. Results A clear pattern of higher pain thresholds in the mid-line was evident in both groups and for both pain modalities. No discernible patterns were evident for variability within groups, but marked differences were seen between groups: variability for pressure pain thresholds appeared similar between groups, however for heat pain threshold, variability was uniformly low in the control group and uniformly high in the patient group. A highly significant (p 0.0001) difference in pain thresholds for pressure and heat was found with patients exhibiting lower thresholds than controls. No between group difference was found for mid-line lower range for either modality (p&gt;0.05). Conclusions The current study supports previous findings of widespread, increased pain sensitivity in chronic non-specific low-back pain patients. It also indicates that there are discernible and similar topographical patterns of pain sensitivity in the dorsal area in both groups, but that this pattern is related to the lateral position of the test site and not the segmental level. Specific segments with increased pain sensitivity could not be identified in the patient group, which casts doubt on the utility of pressure and heat pain thresholds as indicators of the clinical source of spinal pain - at least in a population of chronic non-specific low-back pain. Implications In a cohort of chronic non-specific low-back pain patients and with the chosen methodology, topographical QST mapping in the lumbar region does not appear useful for identifying the spinal segment responsible for clinical pain, but it does demonstrate widespread group differences in pain sensitivity."
17,2019,30205812,Can lumbar supports treat or prevent lower back pain?,lumbar supports lower back pain,0.0,"Background: Success rates for lumbar discectomy are estimated as 78-95% patients at 1-2 years post-surgery, supporting its effectiveness. However, ongoing pain and disability is an issue for some patients, and recurrence contributing to reoperation is reported. It is important to identify prognostic factors predicting outcome to inform decision-making for surgery and rehabilitation following surgery. The objective was to determine whether pre-operative physical factors are associated with post-operative outcomes in adult patients [≥16 years old] undergoing lumbar discectomy or microdiscectomy. Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to a registered protocol [PROSPERO CRD42015024168]. Key electronic databases were searched [PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PEDro and ZETOC] using pre-defined terms [e.g. radicular pain] to 31/3/2017; with additional searching of journals, reference lists and unpublished literature. Prospective cohort studies with ≥1-year follow-up, evaluating candidate physical prognostic factors [e.g. leg pain intensity and straight leg raise test], in adult patients undergoing lumbar discectomy/microdiscectomy were included. Two reviewers independently searched information sources, evaluated studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias [QUIPS]. GRADE determined the overall quality of evidence. Results: 1189 title and abstracts and 45 full texts were assessed, to include 6 studies; 1 low and 5 high risk of bias. Meta-analysis was not possible [risk of bias, clinical heterogeneity]. A narrative synthesis was performed. There is low level evidence that higher severity of pre-operative leg pain predicts better Core Outcome Measures Index at 12 months and better post-operative leg pain at 2 and 7 years. There is very low level evidence that a lower pre-operative EQ-5D predicts better EQ-5D at 2 years. Low level evidence supports duration of leg pain pre-operatively not being associated with outcome, and very low-quality evidence supports other factors [pre-operative ODI, duration back pain, severity back pain, ipsilateral SLR and forward bend] not being associated with outcome [range of outcome measures used]. Conclusion: An adequately powered low risk of bias prospective observational study is required to further investigate candidate physical prognostic factors owing to existing low/very-low level of evidence."

Case description: We report a case of a 75-year-old man who developed a symptomatic lumbosacral SSDH after undergoing resection of a right temporal glioblastoma multiforme. The patient subsequently recovered and was discharged home. Over the next 2 weeks, he developed progressively worsening symptoms of lower back pain, lower extremity weakness, and urinary retention. Although the patient had no known risk factors for developing a SSDH, magnetic resonance imaging on postoperative day 16 revealed an extensive L2-sacrum SSDH. The patient underwent L2-L5 total laminectomies for evacuation of the SSDH. His symptoms resolved after surgery. Literature review produced 26 other cases of SSDHs after intracranial surgery in patients without obvious risk factors. In our case, the lumbosacral SSDH may have originated from downward migration of intracranial blood in a gravity-dependent fashion. Radiographic evidence of blood within the posterior thecal sac of the patient's cervical spine supports this hypothesis. Conclusions: In most cases, SSDHs after intracranial surgery resolve with conservative treatment; however, as shown in our case, surgery may be required if there is progressive neurologic decline. Neurosurgeons should be aware of this potential complication after intracranial surgery; a magnetic resonance imaging of the spine may be indicated if there is unexplained lower extremity pain or weakness."

We present a case report of lumbar epidural angiolipoma that was totally removed by percutaneous endoscopic technique. Case description: A 63-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of progressively worsening low back pain. No abnormal neurologic finding was noted on physical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a dorsally located L2-3 epidural lesion, suggestive of a noninfiltrating angiolipoma. During the operation, an 8-mm skin incision was made, and a dilator was bluntly inserted toward the interlaminar space, followed by insertion of a working cannula onto the ligamentum flavum and placement of the endoscope. The interlaminar space was enlarged by resection of part of the lower rim of the right L2 vertebral laminae, and the right side of the interlaminar ligamentum flavum was removed to expose the tumor. The tumor was totally removed piecemeal under endoscopic guidance, and pathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of angiolipoma. Conclusions: This report supports the application of percutaneous endoscopic technique in the surgical resection of noninfiltrating extradural lumbar angiolipoma."
17,2019,26604102,Can lumbar supports treat or prevent lower back pain?,lumbar supports lower back pain,0.0,"The modern golf swing is a complex and asymmetrical movement that places an emphasis on restricting pelvic turn while increasing thorax rotation during the backswing to generate higher clubhead speeds at impact. Increasing thorax rotation relative to pelvic rotation preloads the trunk muscles by accentuating their length and allowing them to use the energy stored in their elastic elements to produce more power. As the thorax and pelvis turn back towards the ball during the downswing, more skilled golfers are known to laterally slide their pelvis toward the target, which further contributes to final clubhead speed. However, despite the apparent performance benefits associated with these sequences, it has been argued that the lumbar spine is incapable of safely accommodating the forces they produce. This notion supports a link between the repeated performance of the golf swing and the development of golf-related low back injuries. Of the complaints reported by golfers, low back injuries continue to be the most prevalent, but the mechanism of these injuries is still poorly understood. This review highlights that there is a paucity of research directly evaluating the apparent link between the modern golf swing and golf-related low back pain. Furthermore, there has been a general lack of consensus within the literature with respect to the methods used to objectively assess the golf swing and the methods used to derived common outcome measures. Future research would benefit from a clear set of guidelines to help reduce the variability between studies."

Patients were instructed to complete 20-minute sessions 2x/day for 1 month. Patients completed the Vancouver Symptom Score (VSS) and 48-hour frequency-volume chart before/after treatment. Compliance was assessed with a daily log. We recorded patient-reported improvement. Primary outcome was difference in VSS before/after treatment; secondary outcomes included: differences in frequency of voids/24 hours, max voided volume in 48 hours (%EBC), mean voided volume (%EBC), and mean number incontinence episodes/24 hours. Results: We enrolled 21 patients (3 male, 18 female; median age 9.9 years). We had complete VSS data on 17 patients and frequency-volume chart data on 12 patients. Median % of TENS sessions completed was 98%. 8/17 patients reported subjective improvement. There was a significant difference between pre- and post-TENS VSS (median score: 23 pre-TENS and 21 post-TENS, P = .009). There were no differences in secondary outcomes before/after treatment. Conclusion: In our cohort of medically-refractory OAB pediatric patients, nearly half reported subjective improvement with our regimen, despite modest objective improvement. Our compliance rates suggest this regimen is practical but may be best used as an adjunct to other therapies."
18,2019,33691669,Can electrical stimulation devices treat male urinary incontinence?,electrical stimulation male urinary incontinence,0.0,"Background: Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) has become an effective therapy for patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) who do not respond to conservative treatment. However, an effective treatment strategy for patients who fail SNM has not yet been identified. An option for LUTD is needed when the clinical response to the SNM diminishes. Case presentation: A 51-year-old Chinese man presented to an outpatient clinic complaining of difficulty in urination for &gt; 3 years. The patient also complained of urinary frequency and urgency, accompanied by perineal discomfort. He was diagnosed with LUTD based on his symptoms and previous examinations. The patient underwent sacral neuromodulation with a permanent implantable pulse generator (IPG) (provided free of charge by Chengnuo Medical Technology Co., Ltd.; General Stim, Hangzhou, China) in the left buttock, as he participated in the company's clinical trial to test the long-term effects of IPG. He reported loss of efficacy of the device 3 months after the implantation. We performed bilateral electrical pudendal nerve stimulation (EPNS) therapy for him. After 2 weeks of treatment, he began to report smooth voiding within 2 h after EPNS, and a moderate improvement in urinary frequency, urgency, and perineal discomfort. After 4 weeks of EPNS, the patient reported &gt; 50% improvement in his urination, evaluated with the short form of the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire for Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms. He reported smooth voiding, moderate improvements in urinary frequency and urgency, and the disappearance of the perineal discomfort. He also reported improved sleep and erections. The patient was discharged after 8 weeks of EPNS treatment. Conclusion: EPNS could be an option as an additional therapy for patients with LUTD who have failed SNM."

Methods: Baseline assessment was performed four weeks postoperatively and included 24 hr pad test, bladder diary, and the ICIQ-SF. Patients were randomised into three groups: Pilates (G1), PFME combined with anal electrical stimulation (G2), and a control group (G3). Both treatment groups had to perform 10 weekly treatment sessions. Primary outcomes were mean reduction of daily pads and mean reduction of ICIQ-SF score four months after surgery. The significance level was set at P 0.05. Results: 85 patients completed the study. Differences between treatment groups (G1 and G2) in terms of mean reduction in daily pad usage, 24 hr pad test, and ICIQ-SF scores were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05). The control group differed from G1 in daily pad usage (P = 0.01) and ICIQ-SF score (P = 0.0073). Intergroup comparisons revealed that 57.7% of the volunteers in G1 and 50% of the individuals from G2 no longer used pads by the end of the treatment period (P = 0.57). In the control group, 22.6% were not using pads four months after surgery, with statistical difference compared to G1 (P 0.05). Conclusions: The Pilates exercise program proved to be as effective as conventional PFME to speed up continence recovery in PPUI. It also achieved a higher rate of fully continent patients when compared to the control group in the short-term. Neurourol. Urodynam. 35:615-621, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

There is thus a substantial need to critically evaluate the alternative means of clinical management. Recent findings: This review presents the current evidence for the use of sacral neuromodulation and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation in the treatment of men with urge incontinence, as well as evaluates the financial implications of these treatments. Other alternative modes of electrical stimulation for urge incontinence are also briefly reviewed. Summary: Both sacral neuromodulation and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation prove to be viable, durable options for treating patients with refractory urge incontinence. Alternative modes of stimulation are also beginning to show promise."
18,2019,21310467,Can electrical stimulation devices treat male urinary incontinence?,electrical stimulation male urinary incontinence,0.0,"Objectives: To evaluate the effect of a Cannabis sativa extract enriched in cannabidiol (CBD) botanic drug substance (BDS) and pure CBD, on bladder contractility in vitro. Cannabis based-medicines, including CBD-enriched extracts, have been shown to reduce urinary urgency, incontinence episodes, frequency, and nocturia in patients with multiple sclerosis. Methods: Strips were cut from male Wistar rats and the human bladder body and placed in organ baths containing Krebs solution. Contractions were induced by electrical field stimulation, acetylcholine, KCl, and α,β-methylene adenosine triphosphate. Results: CBD BDS significantly reduced the contractions induced by acetylcholine, but not those induced with electrical field stimulation, KCl, or α,β-methylene adenosine triphosphate in the isolated rat bladder. The inhibitory effect of CBD BDS was not significantly modified by the cannabinoid or opioid receptor antagonists or by modulators of calcium levels, but it was increased by ruthenium red and capsazepine, 2 transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 blockers. In humans, CBD BDS and pure CBD significantly reduced acetylcholine-induced contractions, an effect that was not changed by the transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 blockers. Conclusions: Our data have suggested that CBD BDS reduces cholinergic-mediated contractility and that this effect is modulated by transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 in rats but not in humans. CBD is the chemical ingredient of CBD BDS responsible for such activity. If confirmed in vivo, such results could provide a pharmacologic basis to explain, at least in part, the efficacy of Cannabis medicines in reducing incontinence episodes in patients with multiple sclerosis."
18,2019,20092471,Can electrical stimulation devices treat male urinary incontinence?,electrical stimulation male urinary incontinence,0.0,"Introduction: Radical prostatectomy is the treatment of choice for prostate cancer; although novel techniques have significantly reduced its side effects, the procedure can provoke urinary incontinence of various degrees and/or erectile dysfunction. Aim: We evaluate the effect of a complete pelvic floor rehabilitation program on both incontinence and erectile dysfunction, including climacturia, in a preliminary case series. Main outcomes measures: Pad usage and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) Questionnaire. Methods: Three male patients, previously submitted to nerve and bladder neck sparing radical prostatectomy, presented with urinary incontinence, climacturia and erectile dysfunction of new onset. We decided to manage those subjects with a pelvic-floor rehabilitation program consisting of active pelvic-floor muscle exercises, electromyography biofeedback for strength and endurance, electrical stimulation. The whole program lasted 4 months, with weekly sessions, including general advices on lifestyle changes. Pad usage for incontinence and IIEF-15 were used to assess symptoms before and after the procedure. Results: Before a complete rehabilitation program, pad usage was 1 per day in all the subjects, and the score for erectile function was set at 17 (range 15-20). After the procedure, all the patients experienced a satisfying urinary continence and an improvement in erectile function (mean IIEF score: 22, range 19-24). Similarly, climacturia seems to be subjectively reduced in all the subjects. Conclusion: Pelvic floor muscles exercises seem to result in an improved urinary continence and erectile function after radical prostatectomy. Since this is the first clinical case series dealing with this topic, our outcomes are encouraging and suggest the potential usefulness of such noninvasive treatment modality."
18,2019,14550834,Can electrical stimulation devices treat male urinary incontinence?,electrical stimulation male urinary incontinence,0.0,"The objective of this study was to investigate the extent to which physicians requested home electrical stimulation (ES) treatment for patients with urinary incontinence (UI). Home ES was requested by 429 general practitioners (GPs) and 147 gynecologists within 2 years (1992 to 1994) after the Norwegian National Insurance Service offered reimbursement for the procedure. For first-time requesters, cumulative plots of time to request were compared for GPs versus gynecologists. Characteristics of requesting GPs were compared with those of a randomly selected control sample of nonrequesting GPs, collected by postal questionnaire. A greater proportion of gynecologists than GPs prescribed home ES during the 2-year study period (42% vs 14%, P 0.001). Median time to request for ES was 5.8 months for gynecologists versus 8.6 months for GPs (P 0.01). A greater proportion of female GPs than male GPs requested the treatment (17% vs 13%, P 0.01). Sufficient information about and/or knowledge of treatment indications were claimed by 71% of requesting GPs versus 21% of controls (P 0.001). Altogether, 91% of requesters versus 62% of controls judged that home ES was effective or a good treatment alternative (P 0.001). Requesters (versus controls) prescribed more bladder training and estrogen for urge UI, more pelvic floor exercises and estrogen to treat stress UI, and more ES to treat both types of UI (all P 0.05). Gynecologists prescribed ES more often and earlier than GPs. Prescribers of ES were more proactive in treating UI in their practices than those who were not prescribers."

Material: and methods: The 14 female and 6 male patients included 14 paraplegics and 6 tetraplegics. All of them initially presented hyperactive bladder, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, recurrent urinary tract infection and performed (self) intermittent catheterization. Prior to implantation, an intrathecal test using bupivacaine was performed to confirm the compliances of the bladder. The main indication for implantation was persistent urinary incontinence refractory to medical therapy. Results: After implantation the mean follow-up was 4,5 years. In all, 18 patients used the stimulator alone for bladder emptying and 18 patients were completely continent. The mean bladder capacity increased from 190 ml preoperatively to 460 ml after the operation. The mean residual urinary volume was reduced from 90 ml to 25 ml. No changes were noted by renal isotopic scanning in upper urinary tracts of patients. In 1 patient, a second extradural implant was performed. Discussion: This article also include an overview of a) the different available sites where application of electrical stimulation results in a detrusor contraction, b) the benefits and disadvantages of the sacral posterior rhizotomy, c) selective stimulation techniques that allow selective detrusor activation by sacral root stimulation. Conclusion: Sacral anterior root stimulation combined with sacral posterior rhizotomy is a valuable method to restore bladder functions in spinal cord injured patients suffering from hyperactive bladder refractory to medical therapy."
18,2019,10658460,Can electrical stimulation devices treat male urinary incontinence?,electrical stimulation male urinary incontinence,0.0,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the sacral reflex activity at the striated urethral sphincter relaxation by evoking the potential of the bulbocavernosus reflex (BCR). Methods: 17 normal male subjects were investigated. BCR was elicited by electrical stimulation of dorsal nerve of the penis, and the evoked potential of the BCR (BCR-EP) was recorded by a concentric needle electrode at the periurethral striated muscle. In normal subjects BCR was performed at rest and during voluntary voiding. In 8 of the normal subjects electrical stimulation was increased gradually during voluntary voiding, and changes of BCR-EP were studied. 3 male patients with neurogenic bladder suffering from urinary incontinence caused by involuntary sphincter relaxation (IVSR) were also investigated. In these patients with neurogenic bladder, BCR was performed at rest and during voluntary voiding as well as during involuntary voiding. Results: In the normal subjects stable BCR-EP was elicited at rest and disappeared during voluntary voiding. But a gradually increased larger stimulation clearly demonstrated BCR-EP during voluntary voiding. In 3 patients with neurogenic bladder, stable ECR-EP was elicited at rest. During involuntary voiding caused by IVSR obvious BCR-EP was also elicited, but its amplitude was slightly less than the amplitude of BCR-EP at rest. During voluntary voiding in 2 of the 3 patients BCR-EP was recognized but the amplitude was much less, and in the third patient BCR-EP could not be recognized. Conclusion: BCR-EP was suppressed during voluntary voiding in normal subjects, but insufficiently suppressed in the patients with neurogenic bladder. In these patients BCR-EP during voluntary voiding was suppressed more distinctly than BCR-EP during involuntary voiding due to IVSR. In urodynamic study, the detrusor contraction and the sphincter relaxation were common phenomenon in both voluntary voiding and involuntary voiding, but the difference in the degree of the BCR suppression depended on whether micturition was voluntary or involuntary. It was suggested that the measurement of BCR-EP could distinguish involuntary voiding caused by pathological urethral sphincter relaxation from voluntary voiding."
19,2019,36126325,Can honey offer relief from cough symptoms in children?,honey children cough,1.0,"Background and objective: Cough from URTI is common, leads to discomfort, sleep loss and stress in caregivers, leading to use of ineffective and potentially harmful over-the-counter medications. Honey is cost-effective and safe for children above one year of age. It is readily available and is a potentially valuable demulcent for treatment of childhood cough. The study aimed to determine the effect of honey on cough frequency and severity among children with URTI in outpatient setting. Methods: A single-blind randomised control trial involving children presenting with cough from URTI attending the GOPC of FMC Keffi. Eighty-four children presenting with cough from URTI were recruited, randomised into two groups of 42 and administered Honey (intervention) and Diphenhydramine (control) in three consecutive bedtime doses. Socio-demographic and clinical data including cough frequency, severity and impact on children and caregivers was collected using Paediatric Cough Questionnaire and Kingston Caregiver Stress Scale tool. Data was analysed using SPSS version 25. A p 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Majority (56.0%) of the participants were males, with a mean age +SD of 4±1.47 years. Median cough frequency score for intervention and control groups pre and post intervention decreased (5.00 and 0.00 vs 5.00 and 3.00, p 0.001). Median cough severity score decreased (4.00 and 0.00 vs 4.00 and 3.00, p 0.001), Post intervention pooled caregivers' burden significantly reduced, (5.00 and 11.00 for intervention and control respectively) and sleep pattern improved among children and caregivers (0.00, 2.00 p 0.001; and 0.00, 2.00 p 0.001, for children and caregivers respectively. Conclusion: Night-time honey doses given to children with cough from URTI significantly reduces symptoms and improves children and caregivers sleep compared to Diphenhydramine DPH."

In the studies conducted, it was stated that there was a standardization problem in CAM methods. Moreover, this situation raises the question of ""Which is the most widely used CAM method?"" in asthma treatment. This study aimed to determine the use of CAM methods in children who are followed up with the diagnosis of asthma. Material and methods: The patients aged 4-10 years who were diagnosed with asthma by a physician in the past and who admitted to the Child Health and Diseases Polyclinic of a hospital issuing tertiary health service in Turkey were included in the study. The demographic data of patients and CAM methods used were examined. Results: The median age of a total of 164 asthmatic children included in the study was 6.3 (4-10) years, and 58.3% of them were observed to be male. The median time to diagnosis of the patients was 2.0 (1; 105) months, mostly having multiple cough attacks per day (33.1%), and the rate of children with cough attacks at least once a month to awaken from sleep at night was 47.6%. Honey (36.6%) was found to be one of the most preferred biological-based therapies for families and was followed by molasses (16.9%), which were derived from herbal and natural products. Conclusions: There are varying rates of CAM use in asthmatic children all over the world, and it was found that honey was used the most in our study. Atopy can be found in the etiology of asthmatic patients. Therefore, it should not be forgotten that using different CAM methods at the same time may pose a risk."

After that, the Italian Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology elaborated a comprehensive algorithm to guide the primary care approach to pediatric patients, such as infants, children, and adolescents, with acute cough. An acute cough is usually consequent to upper respiratory tract infections and is self-resolving within a few weeks. However, an acute cough may be bothersome, and therefore remedies are requested, mainly by the parents. An acute cough may significantly affect the quality of life of patients and their family.Several algorithms for the management of acute cough have been adopted and validated in clinical practice; however, unlike the latter, we developed an algorithm focused on pediatric age, and, also, in accordance to the Italian National Health System, which regularly follows the child from birth to all lifelong.

New pathogenic mechanisms in acute cough, including the urge to cough (UTC) mechanisms, have been recently identified. The brainstem neural network, pharyngeal sensory innervation, airway mechanical stimulation, inflammatory mediators, and postnasal drip actively participate in the onset and maintenance of acute cough and the urge to cough phenomenon. However, there is still no effective pharmacological treatment capable of interfering with the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in URTI-associated acute cough. Moreover, severe adverse events frequently occur in administering such cough medications, mainly in children. New evidence has been provided concerning polysaccharides, resins, and honey as potential cough relievers with high antitussive efficiency, effect on the UTC, and minimal side effects."
19,2019,32929686,Can honey offer relief from cough symptoms in children?,honey children cough,1.0,"Cough is a widespread symptom in children and adolescents. Despite advances in scientific knowledge about the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the cough reflex, the best therapeutic approaches for children and adolescents who cough remain unclear, and many needs are still unmet. Many remedies for cough are self-prescribed, reflecting strong demand, but significant evidence of their efficacy and safety is missing in pediatric populations. Moreover, as most coughs are part of self-limited illnesses, treatment could be considered unnecessary in some patients. Drug therapy to relieve cough and other symptoms is an essential part of treating a child with cough. However, unfortunately, the number of studies in each category of cough medications is minimal, and dosing and treatment duration varies significantly among studies. Some treatments have been shown to be no more effective than placebo. Lack of clear indications for dosing and treatment duration, the number of available drugs, the numerous active ingredients in products, and multiple caregivers administering medication to children have been considered contributors to an increased risk of inappropriate prescribing, accidental overdosing, and adverse events. This review presents the most recent evidence on the safety and efficacy of available cough remedies, focusing on the pediatric age group, and includes H 1 receptor antagonists, mucolytics and expectorants, drugs acting peripherally on the cough reflex, drugs acting centrally on the cough reflex, drugs acting both peripherally and centrally on the cough reflex, and other compounds, including menthol, glycerol, honey, and medical devices composed of complex natural substances.

Despite these properties, honey use has been limited in evidence-based medicine due to the lack of evidence in clinical settings, particularly in paediatric population. An increasing interest has grown towards honey during the last years. The aim of this article is to examine the possible role of honey as a therapeutic tool in paediatrics. We performed a literature search to summarise the highest quality evidences, analysed articles regarding honey's nutritional properties and therapeutic value. The state of the art is represented by evidences related to beneficiary effects of honey on respiratory, gastroenterological and oncohaematologic diseases. Many other uses could promisingly come from in vitro studies or clinical trial based on adult samples. Honey shows an excellent risk-benefit profile and can be safely administrated in children older than 12 months. In conclusion, honey does not only represent a grandma's remedy, but is a real useful tool in different clinical settings, including paediatrics practice.

There is a need for effective alternatives to antibiotic prescribing. Honey is a lay remedy for URTIs, and has an emerging evidence base for its use. Honey has antimicrobial properties, and guidelines recommended honey for acute cough in children. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of honey for symptomatic relief in URTIs. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, AMED, Cab abstracts, Cochrane Library, LILACS, and CINAHL with a combination of keywords and MeSH terms. Results: We identified 1345 unique records, and 14 studies were included. Overall risk of bias was moderate. Compared with usual care, honey improved combined symptom score (three studies, mean difference -3.96, 95% CI -5.42 to -2.51, I<sup>2</sup>=0%), cough frequency (eight studies, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.36, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.21, I<sup>2</sup>=0%) and cough severity (five studies, SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.25, I<sup>2</sup>=20%). We combined two studies comparing honey with placebo for relieving combined symptoms (SMD -0.63, 95% CI -1.44 to 0.18, I<sup>2</sup>=91%). Conclusions: Honey was superior to usual care for the improvement of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. It provides a widely available and cheap alternative to antibiotics. Honey could help efforts to slow the spread of antimicrobial resistance, but further high quality, placebo controlled trials are needed.

20,2019,36143916,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,"Background : Cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injection (CIESI) is increasingly used as an interventional treatment for pain originating from the cervical spine. However, serious neurological complications may occur during CIESI because of direct nerve damage following inappropriate needle placement. Case report : A 35-year-old woman presented with posterior neck pain radiating to the left upper arm. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left C6 nerve impingement. CIESI under fluoroscopic guidance was performed at another hospital using the left C5/6 interlaminar approach. Immediately after the procedure, the patient experienced dizziness, decreased blood pressure, motor weakness in the left upper arm, and sensory loss. She visited our emergency department with postdural puncture headache (PDPH) that worsened after the procedure. Post-admission cervical MRI revealed intramedullary T2 high signal intensity and cord swelling from the C4/5 to C6/7 levels; thus, a diagnosis of spinal cord injury was made. The patient's PDPH spontaneously improved after 48 h. However, despite conservative treatment with steroids, the decrease in abduction of the left fifth finger and loss of sensation in the dorsum of the left hand persisted for up to 6 months after the procedure. As noticed in the follow-up MRI performed 6 months post-procedure, the T2 high signal intensity in the left intramedullary region had decreased compared to that observed previously; however, cord swelling persisted. Furthermore, left C7/8 radiculopathy with acute denervation was confirmed by electromyography performed 6 months after the procedure. Conclusions : Fluoroscopy does not guarantee the prevention of spinal cord penetration during CIESI. Moreover, persistent neurological deficits may occur, particularly due to intrathecal perforation or drug administration during CIESI. Therefore, in accordance with the recommendations of the Multisociety Pain Workgroup, we recommend performing CIESI at the C6/7 or C7/T1 levels, where the epidural space is relatively large, rather than at the C5/6 level or higher."

We present the first case of pediatric WCS in the thoracic spine and the first to show complete resolution of symptoms. Case presentation: A 3-year-old girl presented with difficulty ambulating due to pain caused by T4-8 spinal cord compression from a mass of ganglioneuromatous tissue, consistent with her previously treated mediastinal neuroblastoma. She underwent laminoplasty and microsurgical debulking of the mass. She developed severe bilateral leg weakness on postoperative day 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed T2 hyperintensity in the spinal cord from T1 to T10 without enhancement, concerning for WCS. She was started on high-dose steroids and monitored. Her strength improved to 3/5 in both legs prior to discharge to inpatient rehabilitation. On the latest follow-up, 4 months after surgery, she did not demonstrate any neurologic deficits and was ambulating well. Follow-up MRIs have showed continued improvement in the T2 hyperintensity. Discussion/conclusion: Most cases in the literature occur in older adults with chronic cervical compression. Only 1 pediatric case, caused by a cervical arachnoid cyst, has been reported and only resulted in partial improvement. Our case is the first pediatric case of WCS to occur in the thoracic spine, the first pediatric case to demonstrate complete resolution, and the first case of any age to start to establish a length of time the compression is needed to be at risk for WCS."

Treatment with steroids or hypothermia have not been shown to be beneficial, ultimately time to surgery provides the athlete with the best chance of a good outcome."
20,2019,33684579,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,"Background: Acute spinal cord injury (ASCI) is a devastating event that can have a profound impact on the lives of patients and their families. While no definitive medical treatment exists, the role of methylprednisolone (MP) in the management of ASCI and other spinal cord pathologies has been investigated in depth; however, its use remains contentious. While MP initially showed promise in the efficacy of ASCI treatment, more recent studies have questioned its use citing numerous systemic adverse effects. Pharmacologic treatments in this area are poorly understood due to the scarcity of knowledge surrounding the pathophysiology and heterogeneity of patients presenting with these conditions. Despite these shortcomings and due to the lack of alternative treatment options, MP is still widely used by physicians. Methods: We review prior and current literature on the use of MP treatment for ASCI patients with a discussion of novel drug delivery systems that have demonstrated the potential to improve MP's bioavailability at the site of injury while minimizing systemic side effects. In addition, current views on the role of MP and dexamethasone in metastatic spinal cord compression and postoperative infection are reviewed. Results: While some data support benefits in the use of steroids on spinal cord pathology, extensive research suggests at best limited effects and an unresolvable risk/benefit problem. Conclusions: At present, evidence regarding use of dexamethasone for MSCC is contentious, especially regarding dose regiments. Ultimately, further investigation into the use of steroids is required to determine its utility in treating patients with spinal cord pathology."
20,2019,33065692,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,"Study design: Retrospective study. Objective: A retrospective study was conducted to clarify the prognostic factors of postoperative for cervical spine fractures patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Summary of background data: Now the high probability of cervical fractures in patients with AS is unanimously recognized. Fractures mostly occur in the lower cervical spine and two-thirds of patients are accompanied by spinal cord injury. But there are few studies on treatment of AS patients with cervical fracture and it is unclear whether the surgical method, timing of surgery, basic treatment of AS, and different doses of steroids therapy have an impact on the prognosis. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the impact of perioperative factors on the prognosis of traumatic cervical fractures in surgical patients with AS. Methods: Preoperative and postoperative spinal cord function were assessed according to the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) Scores and Improvement rate were calculated. The neck pain severity were rated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) score. The t test and v2-test were used for comparison of clinical data between the preoperative and postoperative groups. Logistic univariate and multivariate regression analysis were used to obtain adjusted odds ratios. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relationship between variables. Results: The degree of fracture displacement in cervical spine fractures patients with AS was most common at the neck-chest junction (26.1%). Patients with degree of cervical fracture displacement less than 50% had significantly improved JOA scores after surgery (P = 0). The incidence of spinal cord injury (SCI) due to fracture was high (52.2%). Patients with combined anterior and posterior is helpful for neurological recovery (P = 0.01). Basic AS treating before injury would be benefit for neurological improvement (P = 0). Conclusion: Basic AS treatment, SCI, and surgical methods are independent factors that affect the prognosis of cervical spine fractures patients with AS. It is controversial to perform surgery and preoperative steroid application as soon as possible. Level of evidence: 3."

The bone and muscle tissues share several catabolic pathways that lead to variable degrees of disability in SCI patients. In this review article, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the available treatment options targeting the skeleton and the bone in the setting of SCI. Among the pharmacological intervention, bisphosphonates, anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibodies, hydrogen sulfide, parathyroid hormone, and RANKL pathway inhibitors represent valuable options for treating bone alterations. Loss phenomena at the level of the muscle can be counteracted with testosterone, anabolic-androgenic steroids, and selective androgen receptor modulators. Exercise and physical therapy are valuable strategies to increase bone and muscle mass. Nutritional interventions could enhance SCI treatment, particularly in the setting of synergistic and multidisciplinary interventions, but there are no specific guidelines available to date. The development of multidisciplinary recommendations is required for a proper clinical management of SCI patients."
20,2019,31954909,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,"Background: ""White cord syndrome"" or reperfusion injury of chronically ischemic areas of the spinal cord is a relatively newly defined etiology in spinal surgery. This rare syndrome is characterized as unexplained new neurological deficits after an anterior or posterior decompressive cervical procedure. The radiographic hallmark is the presence of hyperintense T2 intramedullary signal change after a decompressive procedure without other pathologic changes. We present an additional case of this complication and review the literature. Case presentation: A 79-year-old man presented in consultation for advanced cervical myelopathy. He had experienced 2-3 months of worsening gait instability and issues with hand dexterity. Three days prior to presentation his lower extremity weakness had worsened to the point he was no longer able to ambulate. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine demonstrated severe central canal stenosis secondary to spondylosis with T2 hyperintensity correlating to myelomalacia. He underwent an uncomplicated posterior cervical decompression and fusion and awoke with worsened right hemiparesis from neurologic baseline. Brain MRI was negative for stroke and MRI of the cervical spine showed successful decompression but worsening T2 signal changes. The patient's weakness improved with maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal, steroids, and physical therapy. He was eventually discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility. Conclusions: White cord syndrome is rare and has only been reported in 5 other patients upon review of the literature. Our case is the 7th general and the 5th after posterior cervical decompression. The pathophysiology is thought to be due to a reperfusion type injury of chronically ischemic areas of the spinal cord. All but one patient to date have improved after MAP goal, steroid administration therapy, and acute rehabilitation, including our patients. Spine surgeons should be aware of this potentially devastating complication and how to properly manage these patients' postoperative care."
20,2019,31593138,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,"Rationale: Intraspinal anesthesia, the most common anesthesia type of orthopedic operation, is regarded as safe and simple. Despite of the rare incidence, puncture related complication of intraspinal anesthesia is catastrophic for spinal cord. Here we present an intradural hematoma case triggered by improper anesthesia puncture. The principal reason of this tragedy was rooted in the neglect of spine deformities diagnosis before anesthesia. To the best of our knowledge, there is no specific case report focusing on the intradural hematoma triggered by improper anesthesia puncture. Patient concerns: Hereby a case of thoracolumbar spinal massive hematoma triggered by intraspinal anesthesia puncture was reported. The presenting complaint of the patient was little neurologic function improvement after surgery at 6-month follow-up. Diagnoses: Emergency MRI demonstrated that massive spindle-like intradural T2-weighted image hypointense signal masses from T12 to S2 badly compressed the dural sac ventrally, and his conus medullaris was at L3/4 intervertebral level with absence of L5 vertebral lamina. Hereby, the diagnoses were congenital spinal bifida, tethered cord syndrome, spine intradural hematoma, and paraplegia. Interventions: Urgent surgical interventions including laminectomy, spinal canal exploration hematoma removal, and pedicle fixation were performed. The patient received both medication (mannitol, mecobalamin, and steroids) and rehabilitation (neuromuscular electric stimulation, hyperbaric oxygen). Outcomes: Postoperation, he had regained only hip and knee flexion at II grade strength. His neurologic function was unchanged until 3 weeks postoperation. Six-month follow-up showed just little neurologic function improvement, and the American Spinal Injury Association grade was C. Lessons: By presenting an intradural hematoma case triggered by improper anesthesia puncture, we shared the treatment experience and discussed the potential mechanism of neurologic compromise. The principal reason for this tragedy is preanesthesia examination deficiency. Necessary radiology examinations must be performed to prevent misdiagnosis for spinal malformation."

Methods: The data from 182 SCI patients who sustained a thoracolumbar junction spine fracture were operated by us between September 2008 to January 2015 were analysed retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 underwent methylprednisolone treatment in conjunction with early surgical intervention, while group 2 underwent only early surgical intervention without methylprednisolone treatment. American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor index scores of the patients were evaluated and compared with statistical methods at admission and at the first-year follow-up. Results: The main follow-up period was 14.4±1.4 months in group 1 and 13.6±1.7 months in group 2. Initial and last follow-up ASIA scores of the patients were similar between groups (p&gt;0.05), but the complication rate was significantly high in group 1 (p 0.05). Conclusion: The findings showed that steroids have no significant beneficial effects on the neurological outcome but have significant side effects and leads to increased complication rate in SCI patients."
20,2019,31358617,Can steroids be used as a treatment for spinal cord injury?,steroids spinal cord injury,1.0,"Objective: Due to the continuing debates on the utility of high-dose methylprednisolone (MP) early after acute spinal cord injury (ASCI), we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic and adverse effects of high-dose MP according to the second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS-2) dosing protocol in comparison to no steroids in patients with ASCI by performing a meta-analysis on the basis of the current available clinical trials. Methods: We searched PubMed and Cochrane Library (to May 22, 2018) for studies comparing neurologic recoveries, adverse events, and in-hospital costs between ASCI patients who underwent high-dose MP treatment or not. Data were synthesized with corresponding statistical models according to the degree of heterogeneity. Results: We enrolled 16 studies (1,863 participants) including 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 13 observational studies. Pooled results indicated that MP was not associated with an increase in motor score improvement (RCTs: p = 0.84; observational studies: p = 0.44) and incidence of recovery by at least one grade on the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale or Frankel ( p = 0.53). Meanwhile, MP did not lead to better sensory recovery ( p = 0.07). However, MP was associated with a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage ( p = 0.04) and respiratory tract infection ( p = 0.01). The difference in the overall in-hospital costs between MP and control groups was not statistically significant ( p = 0.78). Conclusions: Based on the current evidence, high-dose MP treatment, in comparison to controls, does not contribute to better neurologic recoveries but may increase the risk of adverse events in patients with ASCI. Therefore, we recommend against routine use of high-dose MP early after ASCI."

We present a case of probable paroxetine-induced serotonin syndrome. Case summary: A 21-year-old female with a history of generalized anxiety disorder and major depression presented with increased depressive symptoms over several months while taking fluoxetine 20 mg daily. Fluoxetine was discontinued without taper and replaced with paroxetine 10 mg daily, along with hydroxyzine 50 mg twice daily as needed for anxiety. Within a week of starting the paroxetine, the patient reported increased anxiety, insomnia, and constant shaking. The paroxetine continued to be uptitrated over a 3-week period to a dose 30 mg due to unremitting depressive symptoms. One month later, the patient presented with tachycardia, generalized body aches, extreme fatigue, weakness, uncontrollable twitching, tremor, and hyperreflexia. A widespread burning sensation accompanied by random hot flashes without diaphoresis was also noted. Serotonin syndrome was diagnosed using the Hunters criteria. Paroxetine was discontinued, and the patient's physical symptoms resolved within a week. Discussion: To date, only 5 cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients receiving SSRI monotherapy at recommended therapeutic doses."

Algorithms from 1999 and 2010 and associated references were reevaluated. Newer studies and reviews published from 2008-14 were obtained from PubMed and analyzed with a focus on their potential to justify changes in the recommendations. Exceptions to the main algorithm for special patient populations, such as women of childbearing potential, pregnant women, the elderly, and those with common medical and psychiatric comorbidities, were considered. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are still the basic first-line medication. Early alternatives include duloxetine, buspirone, hydroxyzine, pregabalin, or bupropion, in that order. If response is inadequate, then the second recommendation is to try a different SSRI. Additional alternatives now include benzodiazepines, venlafaxine, kava, and agomelatine. If the response to the second SSRI is unsatisfactory, then the recommendation is to try a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Other alternatives to SSRIs and SNRIs for treatment-resistant or treatment-intolerant patients include tricyclic antidepressants, second-generation antipsychotics, and valproate. This revision of the GAD algorithm responds to issues raised by new treatments under development (such as pregabalin) and organizes the evidence systematically for practical clinical application."

The question is, which is the best medication for a particular patient at a particular moment? This is especially challenging because GAD is by definition a chronic disorder and new interventions should learn from earlier experiences. An algorithm which can help to use pretreatment information for drug selection is the ""Pretreatment - Next Treatment (PN) - Algorithm"". This article introduces an PN-algorithm for GAD. Methods and results: For the development of a GAD-specific PN-algorithm, all possible pharmacological options for GAD are reviewed and brought into a rank order on the basis of scientific evidence regarding efficacy, tolerability, or price: (1) pregabalin, (2) venlafaxine XR, (3) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, (4) tricyclic antidepressants, (5) buspirone, (6) antipsychotics, (7) benzodiazepines, and (8) hydroxyzine. Based on this hierarchy and patient-specific information, a decision algorithm is derived, which allows to assess and evaluate pretreatment and to select the drug with no contraindications, limited negative or convincing positive effects, or the option which has not been used so far but which is the next compound in the hierarchy. Conclusions: The ""PN-GAD-algorithm"" can be easily translated into a checklist to support clinical decision-making. It can also help to increase patient empowerment and cooperation in long-term treatment."

Results: A total of 975 elderly patients with GAD were identified. Mean age was 75 years, and 72% were women; 29% had diagnoses of comorbid depression. Forty percent of study subjects received potentially inappropriate agents - most commonly, bromazepam (10% of all subjects), diazepam (9%), doxepin (7%), amitriptyline (5%), and lorazepam (5%). Twenty-three percent of study subjects received long-acting benzodiazepines, 10% received short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high doses, and 12% received TCAs designated as potentially inappropriate. Conclusion: GPs in Germany often prescribe medications that have been designated as potentially inappropriate to their elderly patients with GAD - especially those with comorbid depressive disorders. Further research is needed to ascertain whether there are specific subgoups of elderly patients with GAD for whom the benefits of these medications outweigh their risks."

If benzodiazepines may still be prescribed for a limited amount of time (i.e. 6 to 12 weeks) due to the fluctuating nature of generalized anxiety, the chronic evolution of this disorder in most patients often justifies the long-term prescription of serotoninergic (5-HT) or dual-action (5HT-NA) antidepressants and sometimes of 5HT-la partial agonists like buspirone. Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant was the first to demonstrate its efficacy in carefully selected patients; however, due to the side-effects of this molecule recent guidelines based on controlled clinical trials, suggest to use either serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs) or venlafaxine as a first-line treatment of generalized anxiety disorders. Because of its pharmacological profile buspirone remains however a useful option in patients with cognitive or addictive problems, especially alcoholics. If most SSRIs have demonstrated efficacy over placebo, head to head comparisons remain limited except for escitalopram which appear better tolerated than paroxétine in this indication. More recently, an anticonvulsant, pregabaline also demonstrated its efficacy in several clinical trials but the symptomatic profile of generalized anxiety patients likely to respond to this GABA analog compared to other psychotropic treatments remain to be established. The traditional use of other psychotropic agents such as hydroxyzine, an H1 histaminergic receptor antagonist, is only supported by limited scientific data; this is also the case of sedative typical antipsychotics which benefit/risk ratio should be carefully evaluated before being prescribed to generalized anxiety patients resistant to other psychotropic agents. However, the possible use of atypical antipsychotics with a better tolerance profile than the typical ones in this indication is presently under investigation in several countries. At last it is important to realize that most clinical trials in this field only include patients with non-comorbid generalized anxiety and that their conclusion may not always be generalizable to most psychiatric patients who are usually characterized by a high rate of comorbidity. In this population the indication of specific pharmacological treatments should rely on a careful evaluation of the patients drug treatment history, of the duration, evolution and functional consequences of their symptoms and of the nature of their possible comorbidity. The treatment of resistant generalized anxiety disorders remains a question for future research but the use of imipramine or sedative antipsychotics could be an option when other treatments have failed to induce any improvement."

Prevention of GAD recurrence should be the ultimate objective. Many treatments exist to aid in the realization of treatment goals, including benzodiazepines, hydroxyzine, buspirone, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Some SSRIs and an SNRI have been demonstrated effective in both acute and long-term trials, establishing them as first-line therapies. Benzodiazepines are helpful because of their rapid onset of action and efficacy in somatic and autonomic symptoms of GAD. Other medications in the pipeline include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulators, which may have lower abuse potential than currently available agents that act at the GABA receptor; corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) antagonists; and pregabalin. The recent realization of the chronic nature of GAD and the recognition of its frequent comorbidity with depression, coupled with data from randomized clinical trials of newer generation agents, should help physicians better diagnose GAD and achieve the goal of bringing patients to full remission."

Seventy-eight percent of children with PBB had an ongoing cough at their first respiratory review, and of these, only 13.5% had been prescribed 4 weeks of antibiotics prior to their respiratory review. Asthma treatment had been prescribed for 34.0% of children with PBB. Conclusion: PBB is the most common cause of chronic cough in children referred to tertiary respiratory care and is frequently misdiagnosed and undertreated pre-referral. There is a need to facilitate diagnosis and optimal management of PBB in primary care, which could result in earlier symptom resolution and potentially limit disease progression to bronchiectasis."
27,2019,34048716,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,"Background: Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a leading cause of chronic wet cough in children. The current standard treatment in European and American guidelines is 2 weeks of antibiotics, but the optimal duration of therapy is unknown. We describe the first randomised controlled trial to assess the duration of antibiotic treatment in children with chronic wet cough and suspected PBB. We hypothesise that 4 weeks of amoxicillin-clavulanate is superior to 2 weeks for improving clinical outcomes. Methods: Our parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial was completed in four Australian hospitals. Children aged 2 months to 19 years with chronic (&gt;4 weeks duration) wet cough, and suspected PBB were randomly assigned (1:1) using permuted block randomisation (stratified by age and site) to 4 weeks of amoxicillin-clavulanate (25-35 mg/kg twice daily oral suspension; 4-week group) or 2 weeks of amoxicillin-clavulanate followed by 2 weeks of placebo (2-week group). The children, caregivers, all the study coordinators, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment until data analysis was completed. The primary outcome was clinical cure (cough resolution) by day 28. Secondary outcomes were recurrence of PBB at 6 months, time to next exacerbation, change in Parent-proxy Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life (PC-QoL) score from baseline to day 28 and from day 28 to 7 months, adverse events, nasal swab bacteriology, and antimicrobial resistance. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. This trial is complete and registered with Australian/New Zealand Registry, ACTRN12616001725459. Findings: Between March 8, 2017, and Sept 30, 2019, 106 children were randomly assigned (52 in the 4-week group, median age 2·2 years [IQR 1·3-4·1]; 54 in the 2-week group, median age 1·7 years [1·2-3·8]) with 90 children completing the 4-week treatment. By day 28, the primary endpoint of clinical cure in the 4-week group (32 [62%] of 52 patients) was not significantly different to the 2-week group (38 [70%] of 54 patients; adjusted relative risk 0·87 [95% CI 0·60 to 1·28]; p=0·49). Time to next wet cough exacerbation was significantly longer in the 4-week group than the 2-week group (median 150 days [IQR 38-181] vs 36 days [15-181]; adjusted hazard ratio 0·47 [0·25 to 0·90]; p=0·02). The rate of recurrence of PBB at 6 months was 17 (53%) of 32 patients in the 4-week group vs 28 (74%) of 38 patients in the 2-week group, but the difference between the groups was not significant (adjusted odds ratio 0·39 [0·14 to 1·04]; p=0·07). PC-QoL significantly improved from baseline to day 28 in both groups, but there was no significant difference between them (mean difference in change -0·2 [95% CI -1·0 to 0·6]; p=0·64). From day 28 to 7 months, median PC-QoL remained stable in both groups with no difference in change between them. Data on respiratory pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (paired swabs available for 48 children) were similar between groups. Adverse events occurred in 13 (25%) children in the 2-week group and ten (19%) in the 4-week group (p=0·57). Interpretation: A 4-week course of amoxicillin-clavulanate for treating children with chronic wet cough and suspected PBB confers little advantage compared with a 2-week course in achieving clinical cure by 28 days. However, as a 4-week duration led to a longer cough-free period, identifying children who would benefit from a longer antibiotic course is a priority.

Limited information in this field is available and the management is based on expert opinion. Patient concerns: An 8-year-old girl admitted for 7 days history of wet cough, purulent fetid sputum, shortness of breath and low-grade fever. The wet cough has presented for the past 4 years, during which she had frequent hospitalization for recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. Diagnosis: Chest high-resolution computerized tomography revealed diffuse bronchial dilations accompanied by inflammation in the bilateral lung fields. Microbiologic investigation for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interventions: With a working diagnosis of bronchiectasis with secondary pulmonary infection, sensitive cefoperazone-sulbactam was administrated for 14 days with gradual improvement of clinical symptoms. Bronchoscopy washing substantially soothed the symptoms, reducing the cough and sputum volumes. Outcomes: The child was discharged after 14 days, and treated on long-term prophylactic antibiotic use (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 20 mg/kg/d, ≥ 4 weeks). Lessons: Although bronchiectasisis are condition in childhood, the diagnosis is suspected in children with persistent wet or productive cough, and should be confirmed by a chest high-resolution computerized tomography scan. Antibiotics and airway clearance techniques represent the milestones of bronchiectasis management although there are only a few guidelines in children."

However, the understanding of this disease remains limited. The present study aims to update PBB in children. Methods: The clinical data of children with PBB from 2014 to 2018 were retrospectively analyzed, and PBB clinical features of published studies were summarized. Electronic databases were searched in May 2019. Clinical studies were included in the present study. Reviews were undertaken in duplicate. Results: Totally 712 cases were analyzed in this study, including 52 cases in our center and 660 cases from 14 studies. In the 52 cases, 88.5% of patients with PBB were less than 6 years old and all of them complained of wet cough. Three cases were confirmed with laryngomalacia, and microbiologically-based-PBB were identified in 13 cases (9 Streptococcus pneumonia, 3 Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Twenty cases were completely remitted after treatment. In the 14 studies, the patients with PBB were typically younger than 3 years old, accompanying wheezing and airway malacia. Co-infection was common in most western cases, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza and Moraxella catarrhalis were the top three pathogens. Symptoms were improved in most patients, whereas some cases with comorbidities required prolonged antibiotics treatment. Conclusions: PBB is common in male infants with chronic wet cough and accompanied by wheezing and airway deformities. Most cases are clinically diagnosed PBB in China and microbiologically-based-PBB is common in western countries. Co-infection could be found, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza were the most frequent etiology in China and western countries, respectively. Patients with comorbidities may need extended antibiotics treatment for more than 2 weeks."

The objective of this article is to collate the pediatric components of the CHEST chronic cough guidelines that have recently updated the 2006 guidelines to assist general and specialist medical practitioners in the evaluation and management of children who present with chronic cough. Methods: We reviewed all current CHEST Expert Cough Panel's statements and extracted recommendations and suggestions relating to children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (&gt; 4 weeks duration). Additionally, we undertook systematic reviews to update other sections we considered relevant and important. Results: The eight recent CHEST guidelines relevant to children, based on systematic reviews, reported some high-quality evidence in the management of chronic cough in children (eg, use of algorithms and management of wet/productive cough using appropriate antibiotics). However, much evidence is still inadequate, particularly in the management of non-specific cough in the community. Conclusions: The recommendations and suggestions related to the management of chronic cough in the pediatric age group have been based upon high-quality systematic reviews and are summarized in this article. Compared to the 2006 Cough Guidelines, there is now high-quality evidence for some aspects of the management of chronic cough in children. However, further studies particularly in primary health care are required."
27,2019,32094154,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,"Background: Hospitalisation with severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in early childhood is associated with ongoing respiratory symptoms and possible later development of bronchiectasis. We aimed to reduce this intermediate respiratory morbidity with a community intervention programme at time of discharge. Methods: This randomised, controlled, single-blind trial enrolled children aged 2 years hospitalised for severe LRTI to 'intervention' or 'control'. Intervention was three monthly community clinics treating wet cough with prolonged antibiotics referring non-responders. All other health issues were addressed, and health resilience behaviours were encouraged, with referrals for housing or smoking concerns. Controls followed the usual pathway of parent-initiated healthcare access. After 24 months, all children were assessed by a paediatrician blinded to randomisation for primary outcomes of wet cough, abnormal examination (crackles or clubbing) or chest X-ray Brasfield score ≤22. Findings: 400 children (203 intervention, 197 control) were enrolled in 2011-2012; mean age 6.9 months, 230 boys, 87% Maori/Pasifika ethnicity and 83% from the most deprived quintile. Final assessment of 321/400 (80.3%) showed no differences in presence of wet cough (33.9% intervention, 36.5% controls, relative risk (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.25), abnormal examination (21.7% intervention, 23.9% controls, RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.38) or Brasfield score ≤22 (32.4% intervention, 37.9% control, RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.17). Twelve (all intervention) were diagnosed with bronchiectasis within this timeframe. Interpretation: We have identified children at high risk of ongoing respiratory disease following hospital admission with severe LRTI in whom this intervention programme did not change outcomes over 2 years.

27,2019,31624061,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is the leading cause of chronic wet cough in young children from developed countries. Despite its high prevalence there is a paucity of evidence to inform the optimal duration of treatment leading to variation in practice. Relapse of chronic cough is common and recurrent PBB (&gt;3 episodes in 12 months) is associated with a future diagnosis of bronchiectasis. We investigated the factors associated with any relapse (≥1 episode in 12 months) and recurrent PBB in 66 children. No factor was significantly associated with any relapse. Duration of initial antibiotic treatment was the only factor significantly associated with recurrent PBB. Those who received antibiotics for 6 weeks antibiotics were less likely to develop recurrent PBB than those who received for 2 weeks (p=0.046). This is the first study to show an association between duration of initial antibiotic course and therefore future bronchiectasis. Prospective studies are needed to investigate this association.
27,2019,31515408,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for wet cough (productive or chesty cough) in children?,antibiotics children wet cough,1.0,"These guidelines incorporate the recent advances in chronic cough pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. The concept of cough hypersensitivity has allowed an umbrella term that explains the exquisite sensitivity of patients to external stimuli such a cold air, perfumes, smoke and bleach. Thus, adults with chronic cough now have a firm physical explanation for their symptoms based on vagal afferent hypersensitivity. Different treatable traits exist with cough variant asthma (CVA)/eosinophilic bronchitis responding to anti-inflammatory treatment and non-acid reflux being treated with promotility agents rather the anti-acid drugs. An alternative antitussive strategy is to reduce hypersensitivity by neuromodulation. Low-dose morphine is highly effective in a subset of patients with cough resistant to other treatments. Gabapentin and pregabalin are also advocated, but in clinical experience they are limited by adverse events. Perhaps the most promising future developments in pharmacotherapy are drugs which tackle neuronal hypersensitivity by blocking excitability of afferent nerves by inhibiting targets such as the ATP receptor (P2X3). Finally, cough suppression therapy when performed by competent practitioners can be highly effective. Children are not small adults and a pursuit of an underlying cause for cough is advocated. Thus, in toddlers, inhalation of a foreign body is common. Persistent bacterial bronchitis is a common and previously unrecognised cause of wet cough in children. Antibiotics (drug, dose and duration need to be determined) can be curative. A paediatric-specific algorithm should be used."

Guidelines recommend treatment with antibiotics as their effectiveness has been proven. However, factors associated with duration of cough in response to antibiotics in children with chronic wet cough have not been prospectively examined. Objective: To determine if demographic, clinical and/or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) factors are associated with ""time to cough resolution"" in children with chronic wet cough treated with antibiotics after bronchoscopy. Methods: Data from children with chronic wet cough treated with antibiotics after bronchoscopy were extracted from a prospective cohort study database. Cough dairies were used to determine when the cough resolved. Associations between various factors with ""time to cough resolution"" were examined using regression. Results: The median age of the 133 children was 2.4 years (interquartile range, 1.4-4.9). Duration of prior cough at bronchoscopy was significantly positively related with ""time to cough resolution"" (β = .010; 95% confidence interval, 0.004-0.017; P = .002). This translated to; for each month of prior cough, it took an extra 1.02 days to achieve cough resolution while on antibiotic treatment. Gender, age, diagnosis, tobacco smoke exposure, pneumonia history, blood cellularity, and BAL cellular and microbiology profiles were not significantly associated with time to cough resolution. Conclusion: In children with chronic wet cough, duration of cough before antibiotic treatment is a small but significant determinant of ""time to cough resolution."" Research using standardized antibiotic regimes is required to provide clinical and/or biomarkers that can further identify factors associated with the response of chronic cough to antibiotic treatment."
28,2019,35324684,Can antibiotics be used as a treatment for whooping cough (pertussis)?,antibiotics whooping cough,1.0,"Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a respiratory disease caused by infection with Bordetella pertussis , which releases several virulence factors, including the AB-type pertussis toxin (PT). The characteristic symptom is severe, long-lasting paroxysmal coughing. Especially in newborns and infants, pertussis symptoms, such as leukocytosis, can become life-threatening. Despite an available vaccination, increasing case numbers have been reported worldwide, including Western countries such as Germany and the USA. Antibiotic treatment is available and important to prevent further transmission. However, antibiotics only reduce symptoms if administered in early stages, which rarely occurs due to a late diagnosis. Thus, no causative treatments against symptoms of whooping cough are currently available. The AB-type protein toxin PT is a main virulence factor and consists of a binding subunit that facilitates transport of an enzyme subunit into the cytosol of target cells. There, the enzyme subunit ADP-ribosylates inhibitory α-subunits of G-protein coupled receptors resulting in disturbed cAMP signaling. As an important virulence factor associated with severe symptoms, such as leukocytosis, and poor outcomes, PT represents an attractive drug target to develop novel therapeutic strategies. In this review, chaperone inhibitors, human peptides, small molecule inhibitors, and humanized antibodies are discussed as novel strategies to inhibit PT."

Bordetella pertussis is a bacterium that causes whooping cough and is capable of adopting different states of virulence, i.e. virulent or avirulent states. In this study, we explored the nanomechanical properties of both virulent and avirulent B. pertussis as exposed to various antibiotics. The nanomechanical studies highlighted that only virulent B. pertussis cells undergo a decrease in their cell elastic modulus and height upon antimicrobial exposure, whereas their avirulent counterparts remain unaffected. This study also permitted to highlight different mechanical properties of individual cells as compared to those growing in close contact with other individuals. In addition, we analyzed the presence on the bacterial cell wall of Filamentous hemagglutinin adhesin (FHA), the major attachment factor produced by virulent Bordetella spp., under different virulence conditions by Force Spectroscopy."

It is one of the most common causes of death in childhood. It is also a frequent cause of chronic cough in children, adolescents, and adults. Methods: Global and Hong Kong perspectives of childhood pertussis were described. Results: Hong Kong has prided herself in the city's childhood immunization program. There appear to be no major outbreaks of pertussis since the 1960s. Nevertheless, pediatricians may see isolated cases of pertussis or pertussis-like cases from time to time. Occasionally, infants are severely affected with apneas and managed with ventilator supports in the PICU. Outbreaks of the notifiable disease continue to occur despite a reasonable surveillance system and vaccination program in Hong Kong. Vaccination of mothers, adolescents, and adults are efficacious methods to further reduce the risks of pertussis. Macrolides remain efficacious antibiotics especially used early during the infectious phase. Infants with pertussis may require intensive care support and morbidity is high. Conclusions: Physicians should be reminded from time to time that outbreaks of pertussis still exist in Hong Kong and in many cities globally."

Methods This single-center, retrospective cohort study examined the effects of the early administration of macrolides and antitussive agents on cough secondary to pertussis. We divided the patients into two groups based on the median duration from the beginning of the cough to the initiation of macrolide administration: early macrolide administration group (EMAG) and non-early macrolide administration group (NEMAG). The clinical improvement of cough was defined as maintaining a cough awareness score of ≤3 points for 3 consecutive days. Patients The medical records of 40 patients diagnosed with pertussis (≥12 years old) who were able to maintain a cough diary and received no other antibiotics aside from macrolides were included in the study. A diagnosis of pertussis was made using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test. Results The EMAG (24 patients) showed a significantly shorter total cough period than the NEMAG [16 patients; 20.0 (95% confidence interval (CI), 16-28) vs. 30.5 (95% CI, 27-40) days; log-rank test, p=0.002]. There was no significant difference in the post-administration cough periods between the EMAG and NEMAG [11.0 (95% CI, 7-19) vs. 13.0 (95% CI, 5-23) days; log-rank test, p=0.232]. Antitussive agents did not affect the cough. Conclusion The early administration of macrolides, but not antitussive agents, is effective for treating pertussis. Therefore, macrolides should be administered as soon as possible for this disease."

Following a nasopharyngeal swab, she was diagnosed with a pertussis infection, and treated with antibiotics. A chest X-ray showed right atrial dilatation and an echocardiogram was scheduled outpatient. However, after re-presenting with worsening cough and dyspnoea, an inpatient echocardiogram was performed which suggested elevated pulmonary pressures with significant tricuspid regurgitation, as confirmed by subsequent cardiac catheterisation. She had an elective caesarean section at 34 weeks and underwent repeat right heart catheterisation which revealed persistent, and likely pre-existing, pulmonary arterial hypertension. This case highlights the importance of thorough assessment of non-obstetric symptoms in pregnancy in formulating alternative differentials, even after a diagnosis has been made, to prevent potentially life-threatening conditions from being missed. It also shows that although often associated, respiratory and cardiac causes may coexist separately."

Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out between January 2018 and March 2019. Data recording forms were filled by the face to face interview method. Anti-pertussis toxin IgG (Anti-PT IgG) antibody levels were determined quantitatively from the serum samples using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Anti-PT IgG results were interpreted according to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Results: Of the 169 HCWs included in the study, 67 (39.6%) were seronegative and susceptible to pertussis. Seropositivity was significantly higher among HCWs who worked 40-80 hours per week. Thirty-six (21.3%) HCWs had high anti-PT IgG levels, indicating recent infection in the past few years. High-level positivity was significantly more common among HCWs using macrolide antibiotics due to prolonged cough. Anti-PT IgG levels of three (1.8%) were compatible with acute infection and they were not followed up with suspicion of whooping cough and were not isolated. While 125 (74.0%) of the participants said they could get the pertussis vaccine booster dose, only three (1.8%) had done so. Conclusions: The fact that 39.6% of HCWs were seronegative, emphasized the need for the pertussis booster dose. More than 20% of HCWs have had the acute infection without pertussis diagnosis in the past few years. Adult vaccination awareness in HCWs has not yet created a change in behavior. The high rate of seropositivity in macrolide users also shows that we cannot prevent its spread despite treatment. These findings highlight the fact that pertussis can occur in adult age groups and that eradication cannot be achieved without effective adult immunization and surveillance."

Methods: Patients with whooping cough was diagnosed by culture of nasopharynx swabs between January 2016 to December 2018. B. pertussis was identified using specific antisera against pertussis and parapertussis. Drug susceptibility test was carried out using the E-test method. The clearance of B. pertussis in nasopharynx at 7 and 14 days into and posttreatment with macrolides, and β-lactams was compared. Results: A total of 125 B. pertussis samples were collected from patients who received single antibiotic treatment. Among those isolates, 62.4% (78/125) had high resistance with minimum inhibitory concentrations greater than 256 mg/L for erythromycin and azithromycin. The MIC90 of piperacillin, cefoperazone-sulbactam, meropenem, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for these isolates was 0.016, 0.094, 0.094, 0.19, 0.19, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/L, respectively. The clearance rate with β-lactams treatment (68.8%, 44/64) was significantly higher than that with macrolides treatment at 14 days posttreatment (50.8%, 31/61) (χ2 = 4.18, P = 0.04). Macrolides had a better clearance rate at 7 days posttreatment than β-lactams (χ2 = 4.49, P = 0.03) for macrolides-sensitive isolates and a worse clearance rate for macrolides-resistant isolates. Conclusion: B. pertussis isolates had a high-resistant rate for macrolides in our study. Macrolides are the first choice for treating pertussis caused by macrolides-sensitive strains, and some β-lactams such as piperacillin should be considered as alternative antibiotics for treatment of macrolides-resistant B. pertussis infection."

The incidence of pertussis has been increasing in South Korea to due to waning vaccine-induced immunity. Culture has a low sensitivity and a long turnaround time (TAT). Recently, a rapid multi-polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) test with a TAT of about 1 h was developed for the detection of respiratory pathogens (17 viruses and three bacteria), including B. pertussis. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of mPCR for early diagnosis and treatment of pertussis. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients with pertussis diagnosed from May 2017 to June 2019 at a university hospital in South Korea. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were tested using mPCR. Data were extracted from medical records. Results: A total of 27 patients with a median age of 48.9 years (range: 3.3-82.2 years) were diagnosed with pertussis, of whom 9 (33.3%) were male. Eleven (40.7%) had fever, 12 (44.4%) had dyspnea, three (11.1%) had paroxysmal cough, and nine (33.3%) had inspiratory whooping. The median interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was 9.0 days (range: 1-31 days). Twenty-four patients (81.5%) were diagnosed within 2 weeks from symptom onset. All but one patient was prescribed macrolide antibiotics. Twenty-two patients (81.5%) required hospitalization, including three (11.1%) who required intensive care unit care for ventilation. Conclusion: Testing patients with respiratory symptoms using mPCR can improve early diagnosis of pertussis, ensure proper treatment, and may help with outbreak control."

Methods: We designed a matched case-control study nested within a population-based cohort of 267,153 adults aged ≥45 years in New South Wales, Australia (The 45 and Up Study cohort). Excess hospital bed days, emergency department (ED) admissions, general practitioner (GP) visits, and prescriptions were estimated using negative binomial regression models. An additional self-controlled analysis was also conducted to validate the main models, and to evaluate results for those with either asthma or a body mass index (BMI)≥30 compared to those without these risk factors. Results: Based on 524 pairs of PCR-confirmed pertussis cases and matched controls, we estimated an excess healthcare utilisation per case of 2.5 prescriptions (95% CI: 0.2-4.7), of which 1.1 (95% CI: 0.5-2.2) were antibiotics, 2.3 GP visits (95% CI: 2.0-2.6), and 0.1 ED admissions (95% CI: 0.1-0.2). Compared to those 45-64 years, cases ≥65 years had a significantly greater excess for all prescriptions (1.1 vs 4.7/case), antibiotic prescriptions (0.1 vs 2.2/case), and ED admissions (0.1 vs 0.2/case), but no significant excess of respiratory-related hospital bed days. An additional self-controlled analysis confirmed that cases with either asthma or BMI≥30 had higher overall healthcare utilisation but this was not associated with pertussis infection. Conclusion: We found a substantial excess outpatient healthcare burden among adults aged 65 years and over with PCR-confirmed pertussis, supporting further evaluation of preventive measures."

Data sources: This review considered publications from the last 30years in the databases US National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Literatura Latino-americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS), Cochrane, Google Scholar, as well as protocols of the Ministry of Health and recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, related to childhood pertussis (whooping cough), with emphasis on its severe form. This research was based on keywords derived from the terms ""pertussis"", ""azithromycin"", ""antitussives"", ""leukocyte reduction"" in Portuguese and English. Duplicate studies and those with unavailable full-text were excluded. Data synthesis: Among 556 records found, 54 were selected for analysis. Pertussis, as a reemerging disease, has affected all age groups, evidencing the transient immunity conferred by infection and vaccination. Severe cases occur in neonates and infants, with secondary viral and bacterial complications and malignant pertussis, a longside hyperleukocytosis, respiratory failure and shock. Macrolides continue to be the chosen antibiotics, while antitussives for coughing remain without efficacy. The prompt treatment in Intensive Care Units improved the prognostic in severe cases, and transfusion was promising among procedures for leukoreduction. Conclusions: Approaching severe pertussis in childhood remains a challenge for diagnostic and therapy, as the available therapeutic options are still unsatisfactory. Strategies of prevention are expected to reduce the occurrence of severe cases, while new studies should confirm the role of auxiliary therapies."

Results: M. pneumoniae infection was confirmed in 9.5% of analyzed patients. Among 123 confirmed cases, 65% were 5-14 years old, 21.1% 5 years old, and 13.8% were ≥14 years old. Pneumonia was radiologically confirmed in 83.7% of cases, and 22.0% presented extra-respiratory manifestations. A total of 44.7% of cases required hospitalization. Bilateral pneumonia, asthmatic crisis and extra-respiratory manifestations were associated to higher risk of hospitalization (81.3, 72.2 and 66.7%, respectively). Microbiological targeted treatment was monotherapy with macrolides in 60.2% of cases and combined with other antibiotics in 13.0%. Conclusion: M. pneumoniae was the cause of acute respiratory infection affecting mainly to children younger than 14 years old and frequently required hospitalization."
29,2019,36121784,Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,antibiotics children pneumonia,1.0,"Background: Necrotizing pneumonia rarely occurs in children, but when it does it can be complicated by bronchopleural fistula, empyema, pneumothorax, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Antimicrobial therapy is the cornerstone of its management; however, surgery is necessary in some cases. Ideally, surgical interventions are kept to a minimum, but this is not always possible if there is a mass effect from air and fluid in the pleural space, pulmonary necrosis leading to massive hemoptysis, uncontrolled sepsis, or difficulties with assisted ventilation. Case Presentation: Herein we present a patient with refractory pyopneumothorax and ARDS due to pneumococcal necrotizing pneumonia complicated by a bronchopleural fistula. The patient's clinical condition deteriorated despite antibiotics, surgical drainage, and assisted ventilation. Owing to pneumothorax with a high percentage of air leakage, bilateral diffuse collapse of the lungs, and insufficient oxygenation, surgical treatment was considered, but because of the patient's lack of tolerance for surgery due to hemodynamic reasons and the complications associated with surgery, medical treatment was determined to be more appropriate. Surfactant treatment was administered to the patient, resulting in significant clinical improvement. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of surfactant to treat ARDS due to necrotizing pneumonia. Based on the presented case, we think surfactant can be considered as a salvage treatment for such patients."
29,2019,36105148,Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,antibiotics children pneumonia,1.0,"Objectives: Although hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) is an increasing public health problem, there remains limited epidemiological information regarding hvKp infections in children. Here, we conducted a clinical, molecular and phenotypic surveillance of hvKp strains in a pediatric population. Methods: Non-repetitive K. pneumoniae (Kp) strains consecutively collected during 2019-2020 were screened for hypervirulence genes ( prmpA , prmpA2 , iucA , iroB , and peg344 ) using PCR. Positive strains were further characterized by four phenotypic assays (string test, serum killing assay, siderophore production, Galleria mellonella lethality assay), followed by murine sepsis model to determine virulence in vitro and in vivo . Also, capsular types, sequence types, plasmid replicon types, antimicrobial resistance determinants and susceptibility were analyzed. Results: A total of 352 isolates were collected, wherein 83 (23.6%) were hypervirulence genes-positive Kp (hgKp). A significant increase in KPC-2-producing KL47-ST11 among hgKp strains was observed, from 5.3% (1/19) in 2019 to 67.6% (25/37) in 2020 ( P .0001), suggesting the potential dissemination of the hybrid virulence and carbapenem-resistance encoding plasmid among children. Further, hgKp isolates were classified into hvKp (n = 27) and hgKp-low virulence (hgKp-Lv) (n = 56) based on virulence phenotypic assays. In hvKp, diverse genetic clones were observed and K1-ST23 or K2-ST25 strains with sensitivity to multiple antibiotics were prevalent (25.9%, 7/27). Compared with hgKp-Lv, hvKp infection had a higher propensity to involve severe pneumonia (22.2% vs. 12.5%) in elder children and significant higher mortality in mice ( P = 0.0086). Additionally, either hvKp or hgKp-Lv infections were mostly healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired (74.1% vs. 91.9%). Conclusions: These data suggest that K1-ST23 and K2-ST25 are high-risk clones of hvKp, and the genetic convergence of virulence and carbapenem-resistance is increasing among children. Control measures are needed to prevent the dissemination in clinical settings."
29,2019,36066660,Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,antibiotics children pneumonia,1.0,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common typical bacterial cause of pneumonia among children. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a 5-day Amoxicillin-based empiric treatment. However, longer treatments are frequently used. This study aimed to compare shorter and longer Amoxicillin regimens for children with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 5-day and 10-day courses of Amoxicillin for the treatment of CAP in children older than 6 months in an outpatient setting. Studies involving overlapping populations, lower-than-standard antibiotic doses, and hospitalized patients were excluded. The outcome of interest was clinical cure. Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I<sup>2</sup> statistics. Two independent authors conducted the critical appraisal of the included studies according to the RoB-2 tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. We used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) tool to evaluate the certainty of evidence of our results. Three RCTs and 789 children aged from 6 months to 10 years were included, of whom 385 (48.8%) underwent a 5-day regimen. Amoxicillin-based therapy was used in 774 (98%) patients. No differences were found between 5-day and 10-day therapy regarding clinical cure (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.98-1.05; p = 0.49; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Subgroup analysis of children aged 6-71 months showed no difference in the rates of the same outcome (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.98-1.05; p = 0.38; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). The GRADE tool suggested moderate certainty of evidence. Conclusion: These findings suggest that a short course of Amoxicillin (5 days) is just as effective as a longer course (10 days) for uncomplicated CAP in children under 10 years old. Nevertheless, generalizations should be made with caution considering the socioeconomic settings of the studies included.PROSPERO Identifier: CRD42022328519. What is known: • In the outpatient setting, a few international guidelines recommend a 10-day Amoxicillin course as first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). • Recent trials have shown that shorter courses of Amoxicillin may be as effective as 10-day regimens in uncomplicated pneumonia. What is new: • When comparing 5-day to 10-day Amoxicillin regimens, evidence suggests no significant difference in clinical cure rates for uncomplicated CAP in outpatient settings. • Generalizations should be made with caution considering the socioeconomic context of the population within the included studies."

However, CXR has limitations and cannot discriminate in etiology. Current guidelines recommend against routine use of CXR in children with uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). We used routine care data from a multicentre RCT including 597 children with LRTI symptoms, to evaluate the influence of CXR on antibiotic prescription in the emergency department (ED). CXR remains frequently performed in non-complex children suspected of LRTI in the ED (18%). Children who underwent CXR were more likely to receive antibiotics, even when adjusted for symptoms, hospital and CXR results. Our study highlights the inferior role of CXR in treatment decisions for children with LRTI as CXR, regardless of its results, is independently associated with more antibiotic prescriptions."

In China, RDN is widely used in the combined treatment of infectious diseases. Objective: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of RDN combined with azithromycin (AZM) for the treatment of mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) among children and to determine its safety, providing an evidence-based reference for clinical treatment. Methods: Eight databases were searched, including 4 English databases, namely, PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, and 4 Chinese databases, namely, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, China Science and Technology Journal Database (CQVIP), and Sino-Med. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in which RDN was combined with AZM for the treatment of MP pediatric patients. A comprehensive search was performed from the inception of each database until April 25, 2022. Results: A total of 20 studies covering 1628 children were included. Meta-analysis showed that the clinical effectiveness rate (RR = 1.20, 95% CI [1.15, 1.26], I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), time elapsed until disappearance of cough (MD = -2.04, 95% CI [-2.67, -1.41], I<sup>2</sup> = 91%), time elapsed until disappearance of lung rales (MD = -2.55, 95% CI [-3.12, -1.98], I<sup>2</sup> = 95%), time elapsed until reduction of fever (MD = -1.93, 95% CI [-2.37, -1.49], I<sup>2</sup> = 92%), TNF-α level after treatment (SMD = -1.17, 95% CI [-1.96, -0.39], I<sup>2</sup> = 97%), and IL-6 levels after treatment (SMD = -2.65, 95% CI [-3.51, -1.78], I<sup>2</sup> = 97%) of the combined treatment of MPP were superior to those of other methods, and incidence of adverse reactions (RR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.56, 1.00], I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) showed statistically significant differences. Conclusion: RDN combined with AZM for the treatment of MP among children results in increased clinical efficacy with high safety."
29,2019,36000331,Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,antibiotics children pneumonia,1.0,"Objective: To characterize the outcomes of children with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) across 41 United States hospitals and evaluate factors associated with potentially unnecessary admissions. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of patients with CAP from 41 United States pediatric hospitals and evaluated clinical outcomes using a composite ordinal severity outcome: mild-discharged (discharged from the emergency department), mild-admitted (hospitalized without other interventions), moderate (provision of intravenous fluids, supplemental oxygen, broadening of antibiotics, complicated pneumonia, and presumed sepsis) or severe (ICU, positive-pressure ventilation, vasoactive infusion, chest drainage, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, severe sepsis, or death). Our primary outcome was potentially unnecessary admissions (ie, mild-admitted). Among mild-discharged and mild-admitted patients, we constructed a generalized linear mixed model for mild-admitted severity and assessed the role of fixed (demographics and clinical testing) and random effects (institution) on this outcome. Results: Of 125 180 children, 68.3% were classified as mild-discharged, 6.6% as mild-admitted, 20.6% as moderate and 4.5% as severe. Among admitted patients (n = 39 692), 8321 (21%) were in the mild-admitted group, with substantial variability in this group across hospitals (median 19.1%, interquartile range 12.8%-28.4%). In generalized linear mixed models comparing mild-admitted and mild-discharge severity groups, hospital had the greatest contribution to model variability compared to all other variables. Conclusions: One in 5 hospitalized children with CAP do not receive significant interventions. Among patients with mild disease, institutional variation is the most important contributor to predict potentially unnecessary admissions. Improved prognostic tools are needed to reduce potentially unnecessary hospitalization of children with CAP."
29,2019,35939347,Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,antibiotics children pneumonia,1.0,"Background: Tuberculosis (TB) can present as acute, severe pneumonia in children, but features which distinguish TB from other causes of pneumonia are not well understood. We conducted a systematic review to determine the prevalence and to explore clinical and demographic predictors of TB in children presenting with pneumonia over three decades. Methods: We searched for peer-reviewed, English language studies published between 1990 and 2020 that included children aged between 1 month and 17 years with pneumonia and prospectively evaluated for TB. There were 895 abstracts and titles screened, and 72 full text articles assessed for eligibility. Results: Thirteen clinical studies, two autopsy studies and one systematic review were included in analyses. Majority of studies were from Africa (12/15) and included children less than five years age. Prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed TB in children with pneumonia ranged from 0.2% to 14.8% (median = 3.7%, interquartile range (IQR) = 5.95) and remained stable over the three decades. TB may be more likely in children with pneumonia if they have a history of close TB contact, HIV infection, malnutrition, age less than one year or failure to respond to empirical antibiotics. However, these features have limited discriminatory value as TB commonly presents as acute severe pneumonia - with a short duration of cough, and clinical and radiographic features indistinguishable from other causes of pneumonia. Approximately half of patients with TB respond to initial empirical antibiotics, presumably due to bacterial co-infection, and follow-up may be critical to detect and treat TB. Conclusion: TB should be considered as a potential cause or comorbidity in all children presenting with pneumonia in high burden settings. Clinicians should be alert to the presence of known risk factors for TB and bacteriological confirmation sought whenever possible. Quality data regarding clinical predictors of TB in childhood pneumonia are lacking. Further, prospective research is needed to better understand predictors and prevalence of TB in childhood pneumonia, particularly in TB endemic settings outside of Africa and in older children. Children of all ages with pneumonia should be included in research on improved, point-of-care TB diagnostics to support early case detection and treatment."
29,2019,35922185,Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,antibiotics children pneumonia,1.0,"Objective: To understand the risk factors and antibiotics-resistant patterns of invasive Acinetobacter baumannii infection in Children. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in 6 tertiary hospitals from January 2016 to December 2018. The basic information, clinical data and the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing were collected from the 98 pediatric inpatients with Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid and analyzed. According to the susceptibility of the infected strains to carbapenems, they were divided into carbapenem-sensitive Acinetobacter baumannii (CSAB) group and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) group. According to the possible sources of infection, they were divided into nosocomial infection group and community infection group. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test were used to analyze categorical variables and rank sum test were used to analyze continuous variables. The risk factors of invasive CRAB infection in children were analyzed by Logistic regression. Result: There were 56 males and 42 females in 98 cases. The onset age of patients was 8 (2, 24) months. There were 62 cases (63%) from rural area. A total of 87 cases (89%) were confirmed with bloodstream infection, and 12 cases (12%) confirmed with meningitis (1 case was accompanied with bloodstream infection). In these patients, 66 cases (67%) received invasive medical procedures or surgery, 54 cases (55%) received carbapenems-containing therapy. Twenty-four cases were infected with CRAB, and 74 cases with CSAB. The onset age of cases in CRAB group was lower than that in CSAB group (4 (1, 9) vs. 10 (4, 24) months, Z= -2.16, P =0.031). The proportions of hospitalization in intensive care unit, carbapenem antibiotics using, pneumonia and adverse prognosis in CRAB group were higher than those in CSAB group (6 cases (25%) vs. 4 cases (5%), 18 cases (75%) vs. 36 cases (49%), 17 cases (71%) vs. 17 cases (23%), 6 cases (25%) vs. 4 cases (5%), χ<sup>2</sup>=5.61, 5.09, 18.32, 5.61, all P 0.05). Seventy-seven cases were nosocomial infection and 21 cases were hospital-acquired infection. The proportion of children hospitalized in high-risk wards for nosocomial infections, length of hospitalization, number of antimicrobial therapy received and duration of antimicrobial therapy were higher in the hospital associated infection group than those in the community acquired infection group (all P 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that children from rural area ( OR =8.42, 95% CI 1.45-48.88), prior mechanical ventilation ( OR =12.62, 95% CI 1.31-121.76), and prior antibiotic therapy ( OR =4.90, 95% CI 1.35-17.72) were independent risk factors for CRAB infection. The resistance percentage of CSAB isolates to many classes of antibiotics was 6% except to gentamicin, which was as high as 20% (13/65). All CRAB isolates of resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam (20/20), cefepime (23/23), piperacillin (17/17), meropenem (23/23) and imipenem (24/24) were 100%. The resistance percentage to other antibiotics were up to 42%-96%. Conclusions: Most of invasive Acinetobacter baumannii infection in children in China are hospital-acquired. The outcome of invasive CRAB infection was poorer than that of CSAB infection. The drug resistance rate of CRAB strains isolated is high. Living in rural area, prior invasive mechanical ventilation and prior antibiotic therapy were independent risk factors for invasive CRAB infection. The prevention and control of nosocomial infection and appropriate use of antibiotics to reduce Acinetobacter baumannii infection."
29,2019,35913919,Can antibiotics be use to treat community acquired pneumonia in children?,antibiotics children pneumonia,1.0,"Background: Increased coverage of interventions have been advocated to reduce under-five mortality. However, Ghana failed to achieve the Millennium Development Goal on child survival in 2015 despite improved coverage levels of some child health interventions. Therefore, there is the need to determine which interventions contributed the most to mortality reduction and those that can further rapidly reduce mortality to inform the prioritization of the scale-up of interventions. Materials and methods: Deterministic mathematical modeling was done using Lives Saved and Missed Opportunity Tools. Secondary data was used, and the period of the evaluation was between 2008 and 2014. Some of the interventions assessed were complementary feeding, skilled delivery, and rotavirus vaccine. Results: A total of 48,084 lives were saved from changes in coverage of interventions and a reduction in the prevalence of stunting and wasting. Reduction in wasting prevalence saved 10,372(21.6%) lives, insecticide-treated net/indoor residual spraying 6,437(13.4%) lives saved, reduction in stunting 4,315(9%) lives saved and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACTs) 4,325(9.0%) lives saved. If coverage levels of interventions in 2014 were scaled up to 90% in 2015, among neonates, full supportive care for prematurity (5,435 lives saved), full supportive care for neonatal sepsis/pneumonia (3,002 lives saved), and assisted vaginal delivery (2,163 lives saved), would have saved the most lives among neonates, while ACTs (4,925 lives saved), oral rehydration salts (ORS) (2,056 lives saved), and antibiotics for the treatment of pneumonia (1,805 lives saved) would have made the most impact on lives saved among children 1-59 months. Lastly, if all the interventions were at 100% coverage in 2014, the under-five mortality rate would have been 40.1 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2014. Discussion: The state of the package of interventions will likely not lead to rapid mortality reduction. Coverage and quality of childbirth-related interventions should be increased. Additionally, avenues to further reduce stunting and wasting, including increased breastfeeding and complementary feeding, will be beneficial."

Study design: Retrospective review of medical data. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: Fifty-nine patients who experienced acute-onset idiopathic tinnitus (within 12 weeks) with normal hearing and the same number of age- and pure-tone threshold-matched control groups. Intervention: Electrophysiologic studies of the auditory pathway, oral steroids, and ginkgo biloba. Main outcome measures: Pure-tone thresholds, wave I and wave V amplitudes of the auditory brainstem response (ABR), tinnitus handicap inventory (THI), and visual analog scale (VAS). Results: Significantly reduced ABR wave I amplitude and wave I/wave V ratio were found in the tinnitus group compared with the no tinnitus group. Age and pure-tone threshold were significantly correlated with reduced wave I amplitude and small wave I/wave V ratio. The THI and VAS scores were decreased at 3 and 12 weeks after steroid administration; however, overall changes in THI and VAS scores were not significantly different between the steroid and ginkgo biloba groups. Conclusion: Potential cochlear synaptopathy was suspected in the early stage of acute idiopathic tinnitus, even in patients with normal hearing. Age and hearing threshold were potentially associated with the development of cochlear synaptopathy. Low-dose oral steroids and ginkgo biloba induced early subjective relief of tinnitus, which maintained up to 12 weeks, however, those changes did not differ between groups."

Material and methods: An evaluation of scientific articles from PubMed dealing with vascular glaucoma was carried out. Results: The treatment of vascular risk factors in glaucoma patients requires a thorough medical history regarding vascular symptoms (peripheral vasospasm, tinnitus, migraine etc.) and information on the presence of systemic diseases. Furthermore, a 24h blood pressure profile and the determination of the fat metabolism status represent important and simple examinations. Conclusion: Besides optimizing systemic blood pressure, reducing an increased central retinal venous pressure, treatment with statins, calcium channel blockers, Ginkgo biloba extract, increased physical exercise and fluid replacement are options to ameliorate vascular conditions.

It has been the subject of a great number of studies, especially considering its consequences on patient's quality of life. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of hearing aids and/or Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 on tinnitus in patients with hearing loss. Methods: This is a trial randomized-controlled treatment, parallel, double-blind, with three-arm. Thirty-three adults subjects were divided into three groups: group 1 - subjects undergoing drug therapy with Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761; group 2 - individuals fitted with digital hearing aids; group 3 - individuals submitted to drug therapy with Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 and using hearing aids. The tinnitus handicap inventory and visual analogue scale were used to evaluate self-perception of tinnitus loudness and severity before treatment and 90 days after treatment. Results: This study demonstrated a significant correlation between tinnitus handicap inventory and visual analogue scale, before and after treatment. We observed a significant improvement in self-perception of tinnitus loudness and severity after 90 days of treatment with Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 and/or hearing aids. No correlation was found between tinnitus onset time and self-perception of tinnitus loudness and severity. Hearing aids were more effective in patients with a shorter tinnitus onset time and Ginkgo biloba extract was effective regardless of tinnitus duration. Conclusions: It was possible to prove the effectiveness of the hearing aids and/or Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 treatment, which shows success in the control of tinnitus contributing to the improvement of this symptom."
32,2019,30439402,Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,ginkgo biloba tinnitus,0.0,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: In Traditional Oriental Medicine (TOM), the development of hearing pathologies is related to an inadequate nourishment of the ears by the kidney and other organs involved in regulation of bodily fluids and nutrients. Several herbal species have historically been prescribed for promoting the production of bodily fluids or as antiaging agents to treat deficiencies in hearing. Aim of review: The prevalence of hearing loss has been increasing in the last decade and is projected to grow considerably in the coming years. Recently, several herbal-derived products prescribed in TOM have demonstrated a therapeutic potential for acquired sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus. Therefore, the aims of this review are to provide a comprehensive overview of the current known efficacy of the herbs used in TOM for preventing different forms of acquired sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, and associate the traditional principle with the demonstrated pharmacological mechanisms to establish a solid foundation for directing future research. Methods: The present review collected the literature related to herbs used in TOM or related compounds on hearing from Chinese, Korean, and Japanese herbal classics; library catalogs; and scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar; and Science Direct). Results: This review shows that approximately 25 herbal species and 40 active compounds prescribed in TOM for hearing loss and tinnitus have shown in vitro or in vivo beneficial effects for acquired sensorineural hearing loss produced by noise, aging, ototoxic drugs or diabetes. The inner ear is highly vulnerable to ischemia and oxidative damage, where several TOM agents have revealed a direct effect on the auditory system by normalizing the blood supply to the cochlea and increasing the antioxidant defense in sensory hair cells. These strategies have shown a positive impact on maintaining the inner ear potential, sustaining the production of endolymph, reducing the accumulation of toxic and inflammatory substances, preventing sensory cell death and preserving sensory transmission. There are still several herbal species with demonstrated therapeutic efficacy whose mechanisms have not been deeply studied and others that have been traditionally used in hearing loss but have not been tested experimentally. In clinical studies, Ginkgo biloba, Panax ginseng, and Astragalus propinquus have demonstrated to improve hearing thresholds in patients with sensorineural hearing loss and alleviated the symptoms of tinnitus. However, some of these clinical studies have been limited by small sample sizes, lack of an adequate control group or contradictory results. Conclusions: Current therapeutic strategies have proven that the goal of the traditional oriental medicine principle of increasing bodily fluids is a relevant approach for reducing the development of hearing loss by improving microcirculation in the blood-labyrinth barrier and increasing cochlear blood flow. The potential benefits of TOM agents expand to a multi-target approach on different auditory structures of the inner ear related to increased cochlear blood flow, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective activities. However, more research is required, given the evidence is very limited in terms of the mechanism of action at the preclinical in vivo level and the scarce number of clinical studies published."
32,2019,30339143,Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,ginkgo biloba tinnitus,0.0,"Introduction: Multiple interventions have been postulated for the treatment of tinnitus, but none has been established as clearly effective. Ginkgo biloba has been proposed among the alternatives. Methods: To answer this question we used Epistemonikos, the largest database of systematic reviews in health, which is maintained by screening multiple information sources, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, among others. We extracted data from the systematic reviews, reanalyzed data of primary studies, and generated a summary of findings table using the GRADE approach. Results and conclusions: We identified three systematic reviews including four primary studies, all corresponding to randomized trials. We concluded the use of Ginkgo biloba probably does not decrease the severity of tinnitus. In addition, it does not reduce the intensity of tinnitus or improve the quality of life of patients."

In earlier clinical trials, Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761<sup>®</sup> was found to alleviate tinnitus and dizziness in elderly patients. Consequently, a meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of EGb 761<sup>®</sup> at a daily dose of 240 mg on tinnitus and dizziness associated with dementia. Methods: Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of G. biloba extract EGb 761<sup>®</sup> identified by a systematic database search were included in a meta-analysis if they met all of the following selection criteria: 1) diagnosis of dementia according to generally accepted criteria, 2) treatment period of at least 20 weeks, 3) outcome measures covering at least two of the three conventional domains of assessment, 4) presence and severity of dizziness and tinnitus were assessed, and 5) assessment was done before and after randomized treatment. Results: Five trials that met the inclusion criteria were included in the meta-analysis. The risk of bias was judged as low, with Jadad scores of 3 and 5. In all trials, 11-point box scales were used to assess the severity of tinnitus and dizziness. Overall, EGb 761<sup>®</sup> was superior to placebo, with weighted mean differences for change from baseline, calculated in meta-analyses using random effects models, of -1.06 (95% CI: -1.77, -0.36) for tinnitus ( p = 0.003) and -0.77 (95% CI: -1.44, -0.09) for dizziness ( p = 0.03). Conclusion: Our findings support the notion that EGb 761<sup>®</sup> is also effective in alleviating concomitant neurosensory symptoms in patients with dementia."

Objective To compare the treatment effects of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761R and pentoxifylline. Setting The study was performed at Department of Otorhinolaryngology of University Hospital Královské Vinohrady and 3rd Medical Faculty, Charles University in Prague. Method Patients with sub-chronic or chronic tinnitus were enrolled in double-blind trial and randomized to receive 120 mg EGb 761<sup>®</sup> or 600 mg pentoxifylline, each twice a day and in double-dummy fashion over a 12-week period. Main outcome measure changes in 11-Point Box Scales for tinnitus loudness and annoyance, the abridged Tinnitus Questionnaire (Mini-TQ), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Results Full analysis set for efficacy analysis comprised 197 patients (EGb 761<sup>®</sup>, 99; pentoxifylline 98). For both treatment groups, significant improvements were observed in the Mini-TQ, the 11-Point Box Scales for tinnitus loudness and annoyance, the HADS anxiety score and the SDS. There was no relevant difference with regard to tinnitus-related outcomes between the two treatment groups. 20 adverse events were documented in EGb 761<sup>®</sup> group and 36 adverse events were reported for pentoxifylline group. No serious adverse event was reported during the study. Conclusion EGb 761<sup>®</sup> and pentoxifylline were similarly effective in reducing the loudness and annoyance of tinnitus as well as overall suffering of the patients. The incidence of adverse events was lower in the EGb 761<sup>®</sup> group."
32,2019,28723603,Can ginkgo biloba treat tinnitus?,ginkgo biloba tinnitus,0.0,"Introduction: Tinnitus is one of the common diseases of the ear that is associated with numerous physical and mental disorders. One of the known mechanisms in the tinnitus area with unknown reason is oxidative events. Based on the prevalence and economic costs and physical- psychological side effects caused by tinnitus and the importance of finding a suitable solution for its prevention and treatment, the need for further studies becomes more obvious in this context. This review article aimed to review studies on the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba as a medicinal plant on patients with tinnitus. Evidence acquisitions: Google Scholar, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), PubMed, LISTA (EBSCO) and Web of Science have been searched. Results: There are many studies on the therapeutic effect of Ginkgo biloba on patients with tinnitus. Most findings are in contrast with each other so that some of studies reported that Ginkgo biloba is effective in the treatment of tinnitus and other studies referred to it as ineffective herbal medicine. Generally, according to the previous studies and the present study, it can mention that the Ginkgo biloba may somewhat improve tinnitus. Conclusion: Since tinnitus is multifactorial, it is recommended to evaluate patients individually based on the cause of tinnitus, treatment formulas, and different doses of Ginkgo biloba at the more extensive level in future studies."

Complementary and alternative medical approaches have been used to decrease the symptoms of tinnitus and earache. This study was conducted to report medicinal plants that are used to treat ear disorders, especially earache and tinnitus in different regions of Iran. Evidence acquisitions: Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Google Scholar, PubMed, LISTA (EBSCO), Embase, and Web of Science were searched using relevant search terms to retrieve eligible publications. Results: Twenty-three species from sixteen families were used for the treatment of earache and tinnitus in Iran. Plants from families Asteraceae and Lamiaceae were the most commonly used plants for the treatment of earache. Ginkgo biloba was frequently reported for the treatment of tinnitus. Conclusion: This study shows the important role of medicinal plants in the treatment of earache and tinnitus in some regions of Iran. The medicinal plants reported in this review can be considered in treatments for earache and tinnitus if examined more extensively in clinical trials."
33,2019,34985167,Does hypnotherapy help people quit smoking?,hypnotherapy quit smoking,0.0,"Aims: To investigate the comparative and combined effectiveness of four types of components of behavioural interventions for cigarette smoking cessation: behavioural (e.g. counselling), motivational (e.g. focus on reasons to quit), delivery mode (e.g. phone) and provider (e.g. nurse). Design: Systematic review and component network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials identified from Cochrane reviews. Interventions included behavioural interventions for smoking cessation (including all non-pharmacological interventions, e.g. counselling, exercise, hypnotherapy, self-help materials), compared with another behavioural intervention or no support. Building on a 2021 review (CD013229), we conducted three analyses, investigating: comparative effectiveness of the components, whether models that allowed interactions between components gave different results to models assuming additivity, and predicted effect estimates for combined effects of components that had showed promise but where there were few trials. Setting: Community and health-care settings. Participants: Adults who smoke tobacco. Measurements: Smoking cessation at ≥6 months, preferring sustained, biochemically validated outcomes where available. Findings: Three hundred and twelve trials (250 563 participants) were included. Fifty were at high risk of bias using Cochrane risk of bias tool, V1 (ROB1); excluding these studies did not change findings. Head-to-head comparisons of components suggested that support via text message (SMS) compared with telephone (OR 1.48, 95% CrI 1.13-1.94) or print materials (OR 1.44, 95% CrI 1.14-1.83) was more effective, and individual delivery was less effective than delivery as part of a group (OR 0.78, 95% CrI 0.64-0.95). There was no conclusive evidence of synergistic or antagonistic interactions when combining components that were commonly used together. Adding multiple components that are commonly used in behavioural counselling suggested clinically relevant and statistically conclusive evidence of benefit. Components with the largest effects that could be combined, but rarely have been, were estimated to increase the odds of quitting between two and threefold. For example, financial incentives delivered via SMS, with tailoring and a focus on how to quit, had an estimated OR of 2.94 (95% CrI 1.91-4.52). Conclusions: Among the components of behavioural support for smoking cessation, behavioural counselling and guaranteed financial incentives are associated with the greatest success. Incorporating additional components associated with effectiveness may further increase benefit, with delivery via text message showing particular promise."
33,2019,34096875,Does hypnotherapy help people quit smoking?,hypnotherapy quit smoking,0.0,"Background: Cultural trends in the United States, the nicotine consumer marketplace, and tobacco policies are changing. Objective: The goal of this study was to identify and describe nicotine-related topics of conversation authored by the public and social bots on Twitter, including any misinformation or misconceptions that health education campaigns could potentially correct. Methods: Twitter posts containing the term ""nicotine"" were obtained from September 30, 2018 to October 1, 2019. Methods were used to distinguish between posts from social bots and nonbots. Text classifiers were used to identify topics in posts (n=300,360). Results: Prevalent topics of posts included vaping, smoking, addiction, withdrawal, nicotine health risks, and quit nicotine, with mentions of going ""cold turkey"" and needing help in quitting. Cessation was a common topic, with mentions of quitting and stopping smoking. Social bots discussed unsubstantiated health claims including how hypnotherapy, acupuncture, magnets worn on the ears, and time spent in the sauna can help in smoking cessation. Conclusions: Health education efforts are needed to correct unsubstantiated health claims on Twitter and ultimately direct individuals who want to quit smoking to evidence-based cessation strategies. Future interventions could be designed to follow these topics of discussions on Twitter and engage with members of the public about evidence-based cessation methods in near real time when people are contemplating cessation."
33,2019,33411338,Does hypnotherapy help people quit smoking?,hypnotherapy quit smoking,0.0,"Background: Smoking is a leading cause of disease and death worldwide. In people who smoke, quitting smoking can reverse much of the damage. Many people use behavioural interventions to help them quit smoking; these interventions can vary substantially in their content and effectiveness. Objectives: To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effect of behavioural interventions designed to support smoking cessation attempts and to conduct a network meta-analysis to determine how modes of delivery; person delivering the intervention; and the nature, focus, and intensity of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation influence the likelihood of achieving abstinence six months after attempting to stop smoking; and whether the effects of behavioural interventions depend upon other characteristics, including population, setting, and the provision of pharmacotherapy. To summarise the availability and principal findings of economic evaluations of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation, in terms of comparative costs and cost-effectiveness, in the form of a brief economic commentary. Methods: This work comprises two main elements. 1. We conducted a Cochrane Overview of reviews following standard Cochrane methods. We identified Cochrane Reviews of behavioural interventions (including all non-pharmacological interventions, e.g. counselling, exercise, hypnotherapy, self-help materials) for smoking cessation by searching the Cochrane Library in July 2020. We evaluated the methodological quality of reviews using AMSTAR 2 and synthesised data from the reviews narratively. 2. We used the included reviews to identify randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation compared with other behavioural interventions or no intervention for smoking cessation. To be included, studies had to include adult smokers and measure smoking abstinence at six months or longer. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. We synthesised data using Bayesian component network meta-analysis (CNMA), examining the effects of 38 different components compared to minimal intervention. Components included behavioural and motivational elements, intervention providers, delivery modes, nature, focus, and intensity of the behavioural intervention. We used component network meta-regression (CNMR) to evaluate the influence of population characteristics, provision of pharmacotherapy, and intervention intensity on the component effects. We evaluated certainty of the evidence using GRADE domains. We assumed an additive effect for individual components. Main results: We included 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which 312 randomised controlled trials, representing 250,563 participants and 845 distinct study arms, met the criteria for inclusion in our component network meta-analysis. This represented 437 different combinations of components. Of the 33 reviews, confidence in review findings was high in four reviews and moderate in nine reviews, as measured by the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool. The remaining 20 reviews were low or critically low due to one or more critical weaknesses, most commonly inadequate investigation or discussion (or both) of the impact of publication bias. Of note, the critical weaknesses identified did not affect the searching, screening, or data extraction elements of the review process, which have direct bearing on our CNMA. Of the included studies, 125/312 were at low risk of bias overall, 50 were at high risk of bias, and the remainder were at unclear risk. Analyses from the contributing reviews and from our CNMA showed behavioural interventions for smoking cessation can increase quit rates, but effectiveness varies on characteristics of the support provided. There was high-certainty evidence of benefit for the provision of counselling (odds ratio (OR) 1.44, 95% credibility interval (CrI) 1.22 to 1.70, 194 studies, n = 72,273) and guaranteed financial incentives (OR 1.46, 95% CrI 1.15 to 1.85, 19 studies, n = 8877). Evidence of benefit remained when removing studies at high risk of bias. These findings were consistent with pair-wise meta-analyses from contributing reviews. There was moderate-certainty evidence of benefit for interventions delivered via text message (downgraded due to unexplained statistical heterogeneity in pair-wise comparison), and for the following components where point estimates suggested benefit but CrIs incorporated no clinically significant difference: individual tailoring; intervention content including motivational components; intervention content focused on how to quit. The remaining intervention components had low-to very low-certainty evidence, with the main issues being imprecision and risk of bias. There was no evidence to suggest an increase in harms in groups receiving behavioural support for smoking cessation. Intervention effects were not changed by adjusting for population characteristics, but data were limited. Increasing intensity of behavioural support, as measured through the number of contacts, duration of each contact, and programme length, had point estimates associated with modestly increased chances of quitting, but CrIs included no difference. The effect of behavioural support for smoking cessation appeared slightly less pronounced when people were already receiving smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. Authors' conclusions: Behavioural support for smoking cessation can increase quit rates at six months or longer, with no evidence that support increases harms. This is the case whether or not smoking cessation pharmacotherapy is also provided, but the effect is slightly more pronounced in the absence of pharmacotherapy. Evidence of benefit is strongest for the provision of any form of counselling, and guaranteed financial incentives. Evidence suggested possible benefit but the need of further studies to evaluate: individual tailoring; delivery via text message, email, and audio recording; delivery by lay health advisor; and intervention content with motivational components and a focus on how to quit. We identified 23 economic evaluations; evidence did not consistently suggest one type of behavioural intervention for smoking cessation was more cost-effective than another. Future reviews should fully consider publication bias. Tools to investigate publication bias and to evaluate certainty in CNMA are needed."
33,2019,31198991,Does hypnotherapy help people quit smoking?,hypnotherapy quit smoking,0.0,"Background: Hypnotherapy is widely promoted as a method for aiding smoking cessation. It is intended to act on underlying impulses to weaken the desire to smoke, or strengthen the will to stop. Objectives: To evaluate the effect and safety of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation. Search methods: For this update we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, and trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), using the terms ""smoking cessation"" and ""hypnotherapy"" or ""hypnosis"", with no restrictions on language or publication date. The most recent search was performed on 18 July 2018. Selection criteria: We considered randomized controlled trials that recruited people who smoked and implemented a hypnotherapy intervention for smoking cessation compared with no treatment, or with any other therapeutic interventions. Trials were required to report smoking cessation rates at least six months after the beginning of treatment. Study eligibility was determined by at least two review authors, independently. Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors independently extracted data on participant characteristics, the type and duration of hypnotherapy, the nature of the control group, smoking status, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. These authors also independently assessed the quality of the included studies. In undertaking this work, we used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months' follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated abstinence rates where available. Those lost to follow-up were considered to still be smoking. We summarized effects as risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. We also noted any adverse events reported. Main results: We included three new trials in this update, which brings the total to 14 included studies that compared hypnotherapy with 22 different control interventions. The studies included a total of 1926 participants. Studies were diverse and a single meta-analysis was not possible. We judged only one study to be at low risk of bias overall; we judged 10 studies to be at high risk of bias and three at unclear risk. Studies did not provide reliable evidence of a greater benefit from hypnotherapy compared with other interventions or no treatment for smoking cessation. Most individual studies did not find statistically significant differences in quit rates after six months or longer, and studies that did detect differences typically had methodological limitations.Pooling small groups of relatively comparable studies did not provide reliable evidence for a specific effect of hypnotherapy relative to controls. There was low certainty evidence, limited by imprecision and risk of bias, that showed no statistically significant difference between hypnotherapy and attention-matched behavioural treatments (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.61; I<sup>2</sup> = 36%; 6 studies, 957 participants). Results were similarly imprecise, and also limited by risk of bias, when comparing hypnotherapy to intensive behavioural interventions (not matched for contact time) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.82; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 211 participants; very low certainty evidence). Results from one small study (40 participants) detected a statistically significant benefit of hypnotherapy compared to no intervention (RR 19.00, 95% CI 1.18 to 305.88), but this evidence was judged to be of very low certainty due to high risk of bias and imprecision. No significant differences were detected in comparisons of hypnotherapy with brief behavioural interventions (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.69; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 269 participants), rapid/focused smoking (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.33; I<sup>2</sup> = 65%; 2 studies, 54 participants), and pharmacotherapies (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.20; I<sup>2</sup> = 5%; 2 studies, 197 participants). When hypnotherapy was evaluated as an adjunct to other treatments, the pooled result from five studies showed a statistically significant benefit in favour of hypnotherapy (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.35; I² = 62%; 224 participants); however, this result should be interpreted with caution due to the high risk of bias across studies (four had a high risk or bias, one had an unclear risk), and substantial statistical heterogeneity.Most studies did not provide information on whether data specifically relating to adverse events were collected, and whether or not any adverse events occurred. One study that did collect such data did not find a statistically significant difference in the adverse event 'index' between hypnotherapy and relaxation. Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to determine whether hypnotherapy is more effective for smoking cessation than other forms of behavioural support or unassisted quitting. If a benefit is present, current evidence suggests the benefit is small at most. There is very little evidence on whether hypnotherapy causes adverse effects, but the existing data show no evidence that it does. Further large, high-quality randomized controlled trials, and more comprehensive assessments of safety, are needed on this topic."
33,2019,31117151,Does hypnotherapy help people quit smoking?,hypnotherapy quit smoking,0.0,"Background and aims: Understanding whether and how far smokers' characteristics influence the effectiveness of treatment may be important for tailoring recommendations on cessation aids to those most likely to help the user achieve abstinence. This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of commonly used smoking cessation aids and test whether their effectiveness differs according to cigarette addiction, socio-economic status, age or sex. Design: Correlational design using cross-sectional survey data collected monthly between 2006 and 2018. Setting: England. Participants: A total of 18 929 adults (aged ≥ 16 years, 52.0% female) who had smoked within the previous 12 months and had made at least one quit attempt during that period. Measurements: The outcome was self-reported abstinence from quit date to survey. Independent variables were self-reported use during the most recent quit attempt of: prescription nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), NRT over-the-counter, varenicline, bupropion, e-cigarettes, face-to-face behavioural support, telephone support, written self-help materials, websites and hypnotherapy. Moderators were cigarette addiction, social grade, age and sex. Findings: After adjustment for covariates and use of other cessation aids, users of e-cigarettes [odds ratio (OR) = 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.69-2.24] and varenicline (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.51-2.21) had significantly higher odds of reporting abstinence than those who did not report use of these cessation aids. Use of prescription NRT was associated with increased abstinence in older (≥ 45 years) (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.25-2.00) but not younger ( 45 years) smokers (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.85-1.42). Use of websites was associated with increased abstinence in smokers from lower (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.22-3.98) but not higher social grades (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.40-1.38). There was little evidence of benefits of using other cessation aids. Conclusions: Use of e-cigarettes and varenicline are associated with higher abstinence rates following a quit attempt in England. Use of prescription of nicotine replacement therapy is also associated with higher abstinence rates, but only in older smokers, and use of websites only in smokers from lower socio-economic status."

Design, setting and participants: Patients were invited to participate if they were at least 40 years old and had visited participating general practice clinics in Melbourne at least twice during the previous 12 months, reported being current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years, or were being managed for COPD. Interviews based on a structured questionnaire and case finding (FEV1/FEV6 measurement) were followed, when appropriate, by spirometry testing and assessment of health-related quality of life, dyspnoea and symptoms. Results: 1050 patients attended baseline interviews (February 2015 - April 2017) at 41 practices. Of 245 participants managed for COPD, 130 (53.1%) met the spirometry-based definition (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC 0.7) or had a clinical correlation; in 37% of cases COPD was not confirmed, and no definitive result was obtained for 9.8% of patients. Case finding and subsequent spirometry testing identified 142 new COPD cases (17.6% of participants without prior diagnosis; 95% CI, 15.1-20.5%). 690 participants (65.7%) were current smokers, of whom 360 had attempted quitting during the previous 12 months; 286 (81.0% of those attempting to quit) reported difficulties during previous quit attempts. Nicotine replacement therapy (205, 57.4%) and varenicline (110, 30.8%) were the most frequently employed pharmacological treatments; side effects were common. Hypnotherapy was the most popular non-pharmacological option (62 smokers, 17%); e-cigarettes were tried by 38 (11%). 187 current smokers (27.6%) would consider using e-cigarettes in future attempts to quit. Conclusions: COPD was both misdiagnosed and missed. Case finding and effective use of spirometry testing could improve diagnosis. Side effects of smoking cessation medications and difficulties during attempts to quit smoking are common. Health professionals should emphasise evidence-based treatments, and closely monitor quitting difficulties and side effects of cessation aids.

33,2019,25888475,Does hypnotherapy help people quit smoking?,hypnotherapy quit smoking,0.0,"Objective: Understanding smokers' quit experiences and their preferences for a future quit attempt may aid in the development of effective cessation treatments. The aims of this study were to measure tobacco use behaviour; previous quit attempts and outcomes; methods used to assist quitting; difficulties experienced during previous attempts; the motives and preferred methods to assist quitting in a future attempt; identify the factors associated with preferences for smoking cessation. Design: Face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire. Setting: Inpatient wards of three Australian public hospitals. Participants: Hospitalised smokers enrolled in a smoking cessation trial. Results: Of 600 enrolled patients (42.8% participation rate), 64.3% (n=386) had attempted quitting in the previous 12 months. On a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high), current motivation to quit smoking was high (median 9; IQR 6.5-10), but confidence was modest (median 5; IQR 3-8). Among 386 participants who reported past quit attempts, 69.9% (n=270) had used at least one cessation aid to assist quitting. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was most commonly stated (222, 57.5%), although the majority had used NRT for 4 weeks. Hypnotherapy was the most common (68, 17.6%) non-pharmacological treatment. Over 80% (n=311) experienced withdrawal symptoms; craving and irritability were commonly reported. Most participants (351, 58.5%) believed medications, especially NRT (322, 53.7%), would assist them to quit in the future. History of previous smoking cessation medication use was the only independent predictor of interest in using medications for a future quit attempt. Conclusions: The majority of smokers had attempted quitting in the previous 12 months; NRT was a popular cessation treatment, although it was not used as recommended by most. This suggests a need for assistance in the selection and optimal use of cessation aids for hospitalised smokers.

33,2019,24559809,Does hypnotherapy help people quit smoking?,hypnotherapy quit smoking,0.0,"Background: The efficacy of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is well documented. However, due to relapse rates and side effects, hypnotherapy is gaining attention as an alternative treatment option. The aim of this one-center randomized study was to compare the efficacy of hypnotherapy alone, as well as hypnotherapy with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), to conventional NRT in patients hospitalized with a cardiac or pulmonary illness. Methods: We evaluated self-reported and biochemically verified 7-day prevalence smoking abstinence rates at 12 and 26 weeks post-hospitalization. Patients (n=164) were randomized into one of three counseling-based treatment groups: NRT for 30 days (NRT; n=41), a 90-min hypnotherapy session (H; n=39), and NRT with hypnotherapy (HNRT; n=37). Treatment groups were compared to a ""self-quit"" group of 35 patients who refused intervention. Results: Hypnotherapy patients were more likely than NRT patients to be nonsmokers at 12 weeks (43.9% vs. 28.2%; p=0.14) and 26 weeks after hospitalization (36.6% vs. 18.0%; p=0.06). Smoking abstinence rates in the HNRT group were similar to the H group. There was no difference in smoking abstinence rates at 26 weeks between ""self quit"" and participants in any of the treatment groups. In multivariable regression analysis adjusting for diagnosis and demographic characteristics, H and HNRT were over three times more likely than NRT participants to abstain at 26-weeks post-discharge (RR=3.6; p=0.03 and RR=3.2; p=0.04, respectively). Conclusion: Hypnotherapy is more effective than NRT in improving smoking abstinence in patients hospitalized for a smoking-related illness, and could be an asset to post-discharge smoking cessation programs."

Some women continue to smoke during pregnancy although the harmful effects are evident. Aims: To characterise pregnant smokers and to understand their smoking behaviours and preferences for smoking cessation. Materials and methods: Pregnant women (≥18 years) attending the antenatal clinics of two large Victorian maternity hospitals completed a prepiloted questionnaire which included items regarding socio-demographics, smoking habits and attitudes towards quitting. Results: Smoking status was self-reported by 1899 participants; 125 (6.6%) were current smokers and 604 (31.8%) were ex-smokers. There were 87 (69.6%) daily smokers and 38 (30.4%) occasional smokers. Smokers mainly had medium (54; 43.2%) or heavy nicotine dependence (45; 36%). Current smokers were younger, Australian born, not living with a partner, from a lower socio-economic background, multigravida and had a smoker in their household or among friends. Although pregnant smokers were aware of the possible complications of smoking, their motivation and confidence to quit (median) on a 10-point scale were 7 and 4, respectively. The majority of smokers preferred to stop smoking gradually (74; 71.2%). The preferred methods for quitting were medications (49; 47.6%) and hypnotherapy (35; 34.0%). Patches (28; 29.5%) were the preferred dosage form, and nicotine replacement therapy (25; 28.1%) was the preferred medication. Less than half reported that their health professionals discouraged smoking during pregnancy. Conclusions: Health professionals should be more proactive in identifying smokers and offering smoking cessation support in pregnancy. Multidisciplinary smoking cessation interventions for pregnant smokers are warranted."

We aimed to investigate the efficacy of a single-session of group hypnotherapy for smoking cessation compared to relaxation in Swiss adult smokers. Methods: This was a cluster-randomised, parallel-group, controlled trial. A single session of hypnosis or relaxation for smoking cessation was delivered to groups of smokers (median size = 11). Participants were 223 smokers consuming ≥ 5 cigarettes per day, willing to quit and not using cessation aids (47.1% females, M = 37.5 years [SD = 11.8], 86.1% Swiss). Nicotine withdrawal, smoking abstinence self-efficacy, and adverse reactions were assessed at a 2-week follow-up. The main outcome, self-reported 30-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence, was assessed at a 6-month follow up. Abstinence was validated through salivary analysis. Secondary outcomes included number of cigarettes smoked per day, smoking abstinence self-efficacy, and nicotine withdrawal. Results: At the 6-month follow up, 14.7% in the hypnosis group and 17.8% in the relaxation group were abstinent. The intervention had no effect on smoking status (p = .73) or on the number of cigarettes smoked per day (p = .56). Smoking abstinence self-efficacy did not differ between the interventions (p = .14) at the 2-week follow-up, but non-smokers in the hypnosis group experienced reduced withdrawal (p = .02). Both interventions produced few adverse reactions (p = .81). Conclusions: A single session of group hypnotherapy does not appear to be more effective for smoking cessation than a group relaxation session.

Its endocrine disrupting and teratogenic properties impose potential risk to the wildlife and human health. BPA has been linked to reproductive, metabolic, and immunity disorders in humans. Regardless of BPA ban in reusable and baby bottles, annually, 15 billion pounds of BPA still being produced. BPA pollution and its cleanup are major challenges. Therefore, it is essential to develop a suitable strategy to bioremediate BPA. The Trametes versicolor (TV) laccase-based nanoemulsion calcium alginate bead organogel was able to transform 94% of BPA within 2 h of treatment. Organogel showed 60% of BPA removal from actual industrial wastewater in packed bed batch reactor and 67% of BPA removal in continuous flow packed bed reactor. The biological oxygen demand (BOD) of treated industrial effluent was 14 mg/L, which is very much less than untreated effluent's BOD, which was 48 mg/L. The chemical oxygen demand of industrial effluent was 1240 mg/ml, and treated effluent was 248 mg/L, respectively. Hence, application of nanoemulsion-based organogel in packed bed reactor found to be a potential candidate for the bioremediation of industrial effluent containing BPA. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The TV laccase-based nanoemulsion calcium alginate bead organogel was able to transform 94% of BPA.

36,2019,36033787,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,"Background: The goal of this study was to identify potentially important factors for the dental health though heterogeneous effects of risk factors within Chinese adolescent populations with different characteristics by analyzing the repeated cross-sectional data collected in the 3rd (2005) and 4th (2015) National Oral Health Survey. Methods: We studied the relationships between the decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (DMFT) score, which was a discrete value, with the caries risk factors (region, census type, gender, only child or not, parents' education level, tooth bushing, dentist visit history, knowledge score, sugar intake, and pit-and-fissure sealants status), though the Poisson mixture regression model, which could identify subgroups among the full population and estimate the heterogeneous effects of risk factors simultaneously. We performed a series of tests and trend analysis based on the model fitting results to explore the primary causes for the dental caries issue clearly and intuitively. Results: A total of 39,049 teenagers aged 12 years were involved in the analysis. The Poisson mixture regression model clustered all individuals into three subgroups, where the mean values (standard deviations) of DMFT were 0.18 (0.56), 1.31 (1.49), and 2.91 (1.89), respectively. Model fitting results indicated that the heterogeneous effects of the involved risk factors were significant. In addition, we also found significant differences in the distributions and trends of DMFT within different categories of selected risk factors (region, census type, gender and dentist visiting history) from the projection analysis results. The estimated and projected proportions showed that the proportion of high caries risk population in the southwestern region increased by 31.8%, and will become even more severe as it will be the major component of high caries risk population in 2025. Conclusions: We found that the trends for the developments and changes of dental caries within populations with different characteristics were inequality. The regional difference is the primary factor for diversified changes in DMFT. The findings in this study provide support for intervention and prevention policies for the deterioration of dental caries risk within different adolescent populations."

Statistical analysis consisted of descriptive and bivariate analyses (alpha = 0.05). br/&gt; Results: A total of 160 patients from three to 18 years of age fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Seventy-eight percent were male and 69 percent had public insurance. Be- havioral issues, such as anxiety, aggression and nonverbal status, were observed more frequently than reported in the ASD literature. Dental caries, poor oral hygiene and gingivitis were the most common dental conditions observed. Radiographs, sealants, stainless steel crowns and extractions were the most common treatments rendered. Bivariate analysis revealed that subjects who had eight to 15 comorbidities were likely to be older. br/&gt; Conclusions: Patients with ASD have many dental needs and may have comorbid medical conditions that directly affect the safe delivery of GA and dental treatments. As patients with ASD age, the number of comorbidities increases."
36,2019,35953306,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,"Background: School sealant programs (SSPs) increase sealant prevalence among children lacking access to oral health care. SSPs, however, are substantially underused. From 2013 through 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded 18 states for SSP activities in high-need schools (≥ 50% free and reduced-price meal program participation). From 2019 through 2020, the authors assessed SSPs' impact in reducing caries and how states expanded SSPs. The authors also discuss potential barriers to expansion. Methods: For Aim 1, the authors used a published methodology and SSP baseline screening and 1-year retention data to estimate averted caries over 9 years attributable to SSPs. For Aim 2, the authors used state responses to an online survey, phone interviews, and annual administrative reports. Results: Using data for 62,750 children attending 18.6% of high-need schools in 16 states, the authors estimated that 7.5% of sound, unsealed molars would develop caries annually without sealants and placing 4 sealants would prevent caries in 1 molar. Fourteen states reported SSP expansion in high-need schools. The 2 most frequently reported barriers to SSP expansion were levels of funding and policies requiring dentists to be present at assessment or sealant placement. Conclusions: The authors found that SSPs typically served children at elevated caries risk and reduced caries. In addition, the authors identified funding levels and policies governing supervision of dental hygienists as possible barriers to SSP expansion. Practical implications: Increasing SSP prevalence could reduce caries. Further research on potential barriers to SSP implementation identified in this study could provide critical information for long-term SSP sustainability."

Methods and materials: Forty-eight human third molars were divided into four groups (n=12 per group). Fissures were extended with burs and sealed with experimental PFS. The four groups of specimens were treated as follows: 1) EPFS 1: EPFS (Premier Dental) of increasing viscosity, containing microcapsules loaded with remineralizing agents (calcium, phosphate, and fluoride ions); 2) US: fluoride-releasing PFS (UltraSeal XT plus, UltraDent Products, South Jordan, UT, USA); 3) EPFS 2: experimental PFS of constant viscosity containing microcapsules loaded with calcium, phosphate, and fluoride ions; and 4) FT: glass ionomer cement (GIC) (GC Fuji Triage CAPSULE WHITE glass ionomer cement, GC Europe NV, Leuven, Belgium). FT and US were used as control groups. EPFS 1 and EPFS 2 were the experimental groups. Specimens were stored in distilled water for 14 days at 37°C, subjected to 10,000 thermocycles (5°C and 55°C) and finally exposed to microbiological cycling in a Streptococcus mutans-based artificial mouth for 10 days. Replicas were made for scanning electron microscopic (SEM) evaluation and specimens were cut for fluorescence microscopy. Results: Overall demineralization depths at the margin of Fuji Triage were significantly shallower than in the other groups (p 0.05). Overall demineralization depths adjacent to the experimental pit and fissure sealant EPFS 2 (59±15 μm) were comparable to the values of the resin-based pit and fissure sealant UltraSeal XT plus (58±10 μm, p≥0.05). SEM revealed surface roughness of the GIC-based PFS. Conclusions: The experimental PFS with microcapsules containing active components for remineralization did not show a caries-inhibiting effect compared to a fluoride-releasing resin-based PFS. Lower demineralization depths adjacent to GIC sealants indicate an anticariogenic effect through fluoride ion release."
36,2019,35879792,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,"Background: Dental caries affects the majority of children in Jordan, with some evidence of its prevalence steadily increasing. Previous studies have shown that families struggle to establish good oral health practices. The aim of this study was to evaluate the current oral health status and practices of 6- to7-year-old children in Amman, Jordan.r METHODS: A cross-sectional cohort study. The sample consisted of 6- to 7-year-old children attending six randomly selected schools in Amman, Jordan. Measures collected were: I) Caries experience (d3mft/D3MFT), II) Oral hygiene, measured using the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index, III) Dietary, toothbrushing, and dental attendance practices, measured using diaries and parental questionnaires, IV) Participants' basic characteristics: age, education and employment. Data were analysed using SPSS20. Results: In total, 942 children were recruited. Four hundred and fifty-seven were boys, 485 were girls. Their average age was 6.5 years. Eighty-nine percent had decay in their primary teeth. Mean d3mft was 5.1(1 (range = 0-12, SD = 2.9). Only 8% of carious teeth were restored. Mean DMFT score was 0.3 (range = 0-4, SD = 0.8). Mean debris score was 1.07 (range = 0-3, SD = 0.37). Children indicated that they brush their teeth 1.6 times a day (range = 0-3, SD = 0.6). The majority (81%) were unsupervised. Sixty-seven percent of parents did not know the appropriate fluoride toothpaste concentration. Children were having 1.5 sugary snacks in-between their meals (Range = 1-6, SD = 1.1). They scored a mean of 2.5 (Range = 0-5.87, SD = 1.7) in sweetened drinks intake (recommended ≤ 1) and 2.8 (Range = 0-18.57, SD = 1.5) in non-core food intake (recommended ≤ 2) on a dietary questionnaire. Most parents (84%) indicated that their child attends the dentist only when in pain, and 18% indicated that their child is extremely afraid of dentists. Only 32% and 18% were familiar with fluoride varnish and fissure sealants, respectively. Regression analysis revealed that debris score and dental attendance were reliable predictors of caries experience. Conclusions: Six- to seven-year-old children in Amman, Jordan have a high caries experience. Most show signs of poor oral hygiene, excessive intake of cariogenic foods, and symptomatic dental attendance. Their parents lack knowledge on fluoride varnish and fissure sealants. There is a need for oral health promotion tailored to this cohort's need."
36,2019,35790597,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,"Objective: This overview analyzed the quality of the systematic reviews (SRs) available on treatments for molar-incisor hypomineralization (MIH). Material and methods: Six electronic databases were searched (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, Brazilian Bibliography of Dentistry and Cochrane Library) until March 2022. Two reviewers independently performed the selection, the quality assessment (Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 - AMSTAR-2), and the risk of bias assessment of the SR (Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews - ROBIS). Results: Two hundred nine records were retrieved; after removing duplicates and applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 5 SRs remained. Three SRs were rated as showing critically low methodological quality and high risk of bias, and two were rated as moderate methodological quality and low risk of bias. The identified treatments that may be suitable for MIH were classified as (1) non-invasive - casein incorporated into toothpaste and sugar-free chewing gum, toothpaste containing arginine, 0.4% stannous fluoride gel; fluoride varnish; (2) micro-invasive - resin sealants for pits and fissures, microabrasion, dental whitening, resin infiltration; (3) invasive - ART restorations, indirect restorations (metal, composite, or ceramic); and (4) mixed intervention - stainless steel crowns. Conclusion: Despite the considerable number of published papers included in this set of systematic reviews, the evidence supporting the effectiveness of treatments for treating MIH is limited due to the methodological quality and risk of bias of the systematic reviews, as well as the quality of the primary studies (PROSPERO: CRD42020144831). Clinical relevance: Different treatments have been purposed for MIH treatment, but there is still not enough scientific evidence of good quality for the establishment of a definitive clinical protocol for the treatment of MIH."

These involved comparison of different types of dental sealants or their comparison with a placebo/no sealant. There was no restriction regarding language or publication date.Data extraction and synthesis Two authors independently extracted the data from the selected papers which included study characteristics, details about participants, intervention, control, outcomes etc. Owing to inherent heterogeneity and inability to pool up the data, meta-analysis was not carried out and the results were summarised using narrative synthesis.Results A total of nine studies were included. Irrespective of the type of sealants, all the included studies have depicted the direction of the effect favouring the sealant use but the evidence is very low. Individual studies that compared sealants with placebo exhibited better performance by glass ionomer cement-based sealants (Odds ratio [OR] = 0.033; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.007-0.149) than resin-based sealants (OR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.41-1.42).Conclusions Low quality evidence was found regarding the effectiveness of sealants for prevention of caries in primary molars."
36,2019,35688036,Are dental sealants helpful in preventing tooth decay?,dental sealants,1.0,"Bioactive materials capable of preventing the development of caries lesions can be an important preventive strategy. This study aims to evaluate in vitro the alkalizing potential, fluoride release, shear bond strength (SBS), and Knoop microhardness (HK) of self-conditioning sealants with pre-reacted glass (S-PRG) and in vivo their retention, quality and caries prevention using the randomized clinical trial (RCT). Dental sealants FS-conventional (Fluoroshield-Dentsply) and BS self-etching (BeautiSealant-Shofu) were evaluated. Sealants samples (n = 5 per group) were performed to verify the alkalizing potential and fluoride release at neutral and acid pH. For mechanical evaluation of both sealants, twenty bovine incisors were used for SBS test, and twenty sealant samples were performed for HK under 50 g load for 15 s. All measurements were taken after 24h and 30 d. A split-mouth RCT including 28 volunteers (10-14 years) with erupted permanent molars and initial enamel caries lesions was conducted to evaluate BS and FS behavior. Sealant retention (total, partial and total loss) and quality scores were analyzed after 30 d. In vitro and in vivo tests were assessed by T-test, and χ<sup>2</sup> &amp; Fisher tests (α = 0.05). BS demonstrated higher alkalinizing potential at neutral and acid pH and lower SBS and HK at 24h and 30 d (p 0.05). However, the FS had greater fluoride release at neutral and acid pH. Clinically, BS also showed lower retention than FS (p = 0.02), but no sealant quality difference was observed. Both sealants contributed to the remission or non-evolution of caries. After 1 month, the bioactive S-PRG sealant showed in vitro a higher alkalizing potential and lower fluoride release, retention, and microhardness, while in vivo, despite the lower retention, the non-evolution of caries lesions was verified."

Materials and methods: A retrospective descriptive study on dental treatments in primary and mixed dentitions was conducted in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry at the Faculty of Dental Medicine, Lebanese University, from 2015 to 2020. The total number of children was 1291. Data were classified and reviewed according to the dentition type, gender, and type of dental treatment. Results: The number of children decreased from 741 for the period 2015-2017 to 550 during the period 2018-2020 (279 males and 271 females). No significant association was found between the admission periods and the genders. A significant relationship was found between the number of treatments performed in both genders and the dentition types ( p value = 0,015). Males were slightly more likely than females to present for the treatment in mixed dentition (54.58% versus 45.2%, respectively). Results portrayed a significant relationship between surgical treatment and gender ( p value = 0.049). However, no significant relationship between gender and other treatment types was noted. The comparison between the 2 time frames and the types of treatments showed a significant association in composite fillings ( p value = 0.043), extractions ( p value 0.0001), sealants ( p value = 0.039), preventive resin restoration ( p =0.011), pulp therapies ( p value 0.0001), pediatric crowns ( p value 0.0001), and surgical interventions ( p value = 0.013). A nonsignificant relationship was recorded for the appliances and composite crowns ( p value = 0.45 and 0.14, respectively). Conclusion: The present study points out the implications of the COVID-19 outbreak and Lebanon's economic collapse on children's dental status, with the number of children receiving dental care dropping remarkably. A decrease in all types of dental procedures was noted in mixed dentition, whereas an increase in dental treatments related to aggravated carious lesions was reported in primary dentition. More medical and financial aids are required to encourage and support parents' attitude towards children dental care during unprecedented crises."

However, postoperative pain remains a challenging problem after hemorrhoidectomy. This systematic review aims to identify pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for reducing post-hemorrhoidectomy pain. Materials and Methods : The databases of Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE were systematically searched for randomized controlled trails (published in English language with full-text from 1981 to 30 September 2021) to include comparative studies examining post-hemorrhoidectomy pain as their primary outcomes between an intervention and another intervention (or a sham or placebo). Results : Some 157 studies were included in this review with additional information from 15&amp;amp;nbsp;meta-analyses. Fundamentally, strategies to reduce post-hemorrhoidectomy pain were categorized into four groups: anesthetic methods, surgical techniques, intraoperative adjuncts, and postoperative interventions. In brief, local anesthesia-alone or combined with intravenous sedation was the most effective anesthetic method for excisional hemorrhoidectomy. Regarding surgical techniques, closed (Ferguson) hemorrhoidectomy performed with a vascular sealing device or an ultrasonic scalpel was recommended. Lateral internal anal sphincterotomy may be performed as a surgical adjunct to reduce post-hemorrhoidectomy pain, although it increased risks of anal incontinence. Chemical sphincterotomy (botulinum toxin, topical calcium channel blockers, and topical glyceryl trinitrate) was also efficacious in reducing postoperative pain. So were other topical agents such as anesthetic cream, 10% metronidazole ointment, and 10% sucralfate ointment. Postoperative administration of oral metronidazole, flavonoids, and laxatives was associated with a significant reduction in post-hemorrhoidectomy pain. Conclusions : This systematic review comprehensively covers evidence-based strategies to reduce pain after excisional hemorrhoidectomy. Areas for future research on this topic are also addressed at the end of this article."
37,2019,31894930,Can taking laxatives help with hemorrhoids?,laxatives hemorrhoids,1.0,"Common anorectal conditions include hemorrhoids, perianal pruritus, anal fissures, functional rectal pain, perianal abscess, condyloma, rectal prolapse, and fecal incontinence. Although these are benign conditions, symptoms can be similar to those of cancer, so malignancy should be considered in the differential diagnosis. History and examination, including anoscopy, are usually sufficient for diagnosing these conditions, although additional testing is needed in some situations. The primary treatment for hemorrhoids is fiber supplementation. Patients who do not improve and those with large high-grade hemorrhoids should be referred for surgery. Acutely thrombosed external hemorrhoids should be excised. Perianal pruritus should be treated with hygienic measures, barrier emollients, and low-dose topical corticosteroids. Capsaicin cream and tacrolimus ointment are effective for recalcitrant cases. Treatment of acute anal fissures with pain and bleeding involves adequate fluid and fiber intake. Chronic anal fissures should be treated with topical nitrates or calcium channel blockers, with surgery for patients who do not respond to medical management. Patients with functional rectal pain should be treated with warm baths, fiber supplementation, and biofeedback. Patients with superficial perianal abscesses not involving the sphincter should undergo office-based drainage; patients with more extensive abscesses or possible fistulas should be referred for surgery. Condylomata can be managed with topical medicines, excision, or destruction. Patients with rectal prolapse should be referred for surgical evaluation. Biofeedback is a first-line treatment for fecal incontinence, but antidiarrheal agents are useful if diarrhea is involved, and fiber and laxatives may be used if impaction is present. Colostomy can help improve quality of life for patients with severe fecal incontinence."
37,2019,31708504,Can taking laxatives help with hemorrhoids?,laxatives hemorrhoids,1.0,"Although chronic constipation is highly prevalent, its definition remains unclear. Therefore, the prevalence varies depending on reports, and the understanding of actual situations is unclear. Hence, we performed an internet survey on constipation among the Japanese general population to study the background factors and actual situations. Preliminary study on the awareness of constipation was conducted among 10000 people in which 9523 of them was asked if they had constipation at the time of the survey. In this population, 51.5% realized that they had constipation. Multivariate analysis showed the significant association of constipation to age, sex, and past histories or complications of diabetes, hemorrhoids, and cerebrovascular diseases. In a main research composed of 3000 general Japanese population, approximately 30.9% of the subjects reported the use of laxatives to treat constipation, and 43.8% of them were found to use irritant laxatives. Moreover, 67.5% of the subjects purchased laxatives at a pharmacy. The frequency of bowel movement less than 3 times per week was manifested in 36.3% of the subjects, and more than once per week in 21.4%. The percentage of hard (Bristol Stool Form Scale [BSFS] Type 1-2), normal (BSFS Type 3-5), and diarrhea stools (BSFS Type 6-7) was 33.1%, 60.0%, and 6.9%, respectively. The quality of life (QOL) of the subjects with hard and diarrhea stools evaluated by SF-8 was significantly lower than that of those with normal stools. Furthermore, the actual monthly cost for the therapeutic drugs used for treating constipation was less than 1000 yen in 75% of the subjects. Analysis of the IBS-QOL-J indicated that the ≥5000 yen payable group had the lowest satisfaction of defecation among the study groups. At present, many Japanese patients with constipation have not been receiving enough treatment for constipation.

Objective: We compared transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization with mucopexy and vessel-sealing device hemorrhoidectomy. Design: This was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Setting: The study was conducted at 6 Spanish centers. Patients: Patients aged ≥18 years with grade III to IV hemorrhoids were included. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization with mucopexy (n = 39) or vessel-sealing device hemorrhoidectomy (n = 41). Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was the mean postoperative number of days in which patients needed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pain, 30-day morbidity, patient satisfaction, Vaizey score, hemorrhoid symptoms score, return to work, and quality of life. Results: More patients were still taking analgesia in the vessel-sealing device hemorrhoidectomy group during the second postoperative week compared with the transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization with mucopexy group (87.8% vs 53.8%; p = 0.002). For the transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization with mucopexy group, analgesia consumption continued until day 10.1 (mean; SD = 7.22 d), whereas in the vessel-sealing device hemorrhoidectomy group it continued until day 15.2 (mean; SD = 8.70 d; p = 0.006). The mean daily average pain was similar during the first (p = 0.900) and second postoperative weeks (p = 0.265). Mean operative time was higher for the transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization with mucopexy group versus the vessel-sealing device hemorrhoidectomy group (45 min; range, 40-60 vs 20 min; range, 15-41 min; p 0.001). Postoperative complications rate, use of laxatives, patient satisfaction, Vaizey score, hemorrhoids symptoms score, return to work, and quality of life at 1 month after surgery were similar between groups. Limitations: The main limitation of this study was that the 2 groups did not contain equal numbers of grade III and IV hemorrhoids. Conclusions: Transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization with mucopexy is associated with a shorter need for postoperative analgesia compared with vessel-sealing device hemorrhoidectomy.

Traditional rectal dosage forms have been historically used for localized treatments including delivery of laxatives, treatment of hemorrhoids and for delivery of antipyretics. However, the recent trend is showing an increase in the development of novel rectal delivery systems to deliver drug directly into the systemic circulation by taking advantage of porto-systemic shunting. The present review is based on research studies carried out between years 1969-2017. Data for this review have been derived from keyword searches using Scopus and Medline databases. Novel rectal drug delivery systems including hollow-type suppositories, thermo-responsive and muco-adhesive liquid suppositories, and nanoparticulate systems incorporated into an appropriate vehicle have offered more control over delivery of drug molecules for local or systemic actions. In addition, various methods for in vitro-in vivo evaluation of rectal drug delivery systems are covered which is as important as the formulation, and must be carried out using appropriate methodology. Continuous research and development in this field of drug delivery may unleash the hidden potential of the rectal drug delivery systems."

Methods: A multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial was adopted. From October 2015 to July 2016, 60 patients with internal hemorrhoid were enrolled from three medical centers, including Department of Anorectum, Shuguang Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Department of Anorectum, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Department of Anorectum, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. Enrollment criteria: Patients aging from 18 to 65 years old; being diagnosed with the second or third grade internal hemorrhoid; having good communication skills and being able to complete the records and follow-ups according to the research program requirements. Exclusion criteria: Patients combined with other anal diseases, or whose anus tube or rectum suffering occupying lesions; patients currently using other methods and defecation drugs in the treatment of their hemorrhoids; patients in pregnancy or with diseases of heart, liver, kidney or metabolic disorders; patients suffering from constipation due to other diseases and drugs, and long-term laxatives abusers. According to the random number table method, 60 patients were randomly divided into the combined treatment group [30 cases, wheat cellulose particles 1 bag each time, 2 times per day; Diosmin tablet 2 pills, 2 times per day] and the single treatment group [30 cases, Diosmin tablet 2 pills, 2 times per day]. The treatment courses for both groups were 7 days. According to the four-grade scoring method, the efficacy evaluation would be made on six indicators, which were the degree of hematochezia or bleeding, the degree of pain, hemorrhoid prolapse, the shapes and properties of stool, the defecation frequency and the defecation duration. The higher the score a participant got, the more severe the symptom was. The effectiveness was evaluated by the scoring reduction rate, and marked effectiveness and effectiveness were both found to be effective. Incidence of adverse events was compared between two groups before the treatment, and on postoperative 3-day and 7-day respectively. Results: There were no significant differences between two groups in gender, age, internal hemorrhoids gradings, disease course, and onset time as well as the baseline data, such as the degree of hematochezia or bleeding before the treatment, the degree of pain, hemorrhoid prolapse, the shapes and properties of stool, the defecation frequency and the defecation duration (all P&gt;0.05). After the seven-day treatment, there was significant difference in effective rate between combination group and single group [96.7%(29/30) vs. 66.7%(20/30), Z=-4.376, P=0.000]. Meanwhile, the scores of combined group and single group in hematochezia or bleeding were 0(0, 1) and 0(0, 2) (Z=9.241, P=0.002); in shapes and properties of stool were 0(0, 1) and 0(0, 1) (Z=5.364, P=0.021); in defecation frequency were 0(0, 1) and 0(0, 2) (Z=7.552, P=0.006); and in defecation duration were 0(0, 1) and 0(0, 2) (Z=4.425, P=0.035), whose differences were all significant. The scores of pain degree and hemorrhoid prolapse of two groups also decreased, but the difference was not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05). During the treatment, abdominal pain, diarrhea and other adverse reactions were not observed in participants of two groups.

Method: a cross-sectional study was carried out in Malaga and its province, 18-65 years-old throughout a non-probability sampling by quotas (n = 887), stratified by sex, age and counties. All participants completed the QCPP-M, a self-administered questionnaire, validated tool due to its ability to discriminate patients with and without CPP. Results: prevalence of symptoms of CPP in subjects between 18-65 years-old was 22.8% in general population (30.9% women and 15.6% men) (RR = 1.974 for women versus men, 95% CI 1.53-2.55, P .001). After correction by sex and age individuals who practice physical activity had a lower score in QCPP-M that others who do not not (mean difference -0.65 ± 0.27). They were significantly associated with higher scores in the following factors: lifting and/or moving weights in activities of daily life (1.34 ± 0.33), laxatives intake and/or high-fiber diet (2.09 ± 0.48), having suffered from urogenital infectious disease in the past: vulvovaginitis, cystitis and prostatitis (1.77 ± 0.55), hemorrhoids/anal fissure (1.31 ± 0.40) or pelvic trauma (1.21 ± 0, 61) respectively. Individuals who spend more time standing had a tendency to have higher scores on QCPP-M (coefficient of regression adjusted for sex and age of 0.078 points/hour, SE = 0.04, P .068). Conclusions: High prevalence of CPP symptoms in Málaga (22.8%), this is related with significantly several risk factors."

We evaluated the results of 2 techniques at 1 year after surgery. Methods: The clinical charts and data of patients who underwent hemorrhoidectomy between January 2008 and June 2010 were considered and analyzed. Patients underwent surgery with 2 techniques: transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD) hemorrhoidectomy or LigaSure-vessel sealing system (Valleylab, Boulder, CO). Patients were chosen randomly to receive one technique or the other. The primary objectives were quality of life, quality of defecation, and regression of symptoms. Results: Forty-six patients treated with THD and 68 patients treated with Ligasure were enrolled in the study. No significant differences were observed in the rate of postoperative surgical complications or readmissions. Short- and medium-term (1-6 mo) results showed that THD patients had a higher rate of pain resolution compared with Ligasure patients (P .05). Functionally, all patients treated with Ligasure showed more postoperative constipation despite administration of laxatives than patients treated with THD. Conclusions: THD is an effective technique and is associated with the best short-term clinical and surgical outcomes if compared with Ligasure."

The acute abdomen, with a mortality of 9.5%, does not present with rigidity or absent bowel sounds but rather with dull/poorly-localized pain, vomiting, or restlessness, with tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis in up to 50% of patients. Fecal impaction may present with anorexia and nausea. Methods used for bowel care include laxatives, anal massage, manual evacuation, and enemas. Randomized, double-blind studies demonstrated the effectiveness of neostigmine, which increases cholinergic tone, combined with glycopyrrolate, an anticholinergic agent with minimal activity in the colon that reduces extracolonic side-effects. Improved bowel function occurs with anterior sacral root stimulators which may be combined with an S2 to S4 posterior sacral rhizotomy which interrupts the reflex arc by cutting the posterior roots carrying the spasticity-causing sensory nerves. For severe constipation, a colostomy reduces time for bowel care, providing a clean environment so decubitus ulcers may heal. Gallstones occur in 17% to 31% of patients, and acalculous cholecystitis in 3.7% of patients with acute SCI. A high index of suspicion is needed to properly diagnose bowel problems in SCI."

The present study is aimed at quantitatively abstracting the medicinal plant knowledge of the healers trained in traditional ways, in Mayiladumparai block of Theni District, Tamil Nadu, India. Materials and methods: The interviews and field observations were carried out in all the 18 village panchayaths from January to June 2010, consisting of 148 field days. The interviews were conducted with 80 traditional healers, after obtaining prior informed consent. Successive free listing was used to interview the informants. The informant consensus factor (F(ic)) was calculated to estimate the use variability of medicinal plants. Fidelity index and Cultural importance index were also calculated to analyze the data. Results: This study recorded the ethno-medicinal usage of 142 ethno-species belonging to 62 families that were used to prepare 504 formulations. Jaundice had the highest F(ic) value than all the illness categories studied. Phyllanthus spp. was the highly cited medicinal plant to treat jaundice and had high fidelity index value. This was followed by Senna angustifolia and Terminalia chebula as laxatives. The highly cited medicinal plants in each group with high F(ic) value were Pongamia pinnata (antiseptic), Aerva lanata (antidote and snakebite), Blepharis maderaspatensis (cuts and wounds), Abutilon indicum (hemorrhoids), Ruta graveolens (spiritual medicine), Ocimum tenuiflorum (cough), and Solanum trilobatum (pulmonary ailments). Phyllanthus spp., was the most culturally significant species according to this index, followed by Borassus flebellifer. Conclusion: The process of drug discovery has become highly expensive and post-approval and post-marketing withdrawal of drugs is continuing. In such scenario, reverse pharmacology is considered an attractive option. The medicinal plants enumerated in this study with high number of citations and high F(ic) values for illness categories might give some useful leads for further biomedical research."
38,2019,35685985,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,"Background: Scheuermann's disease is the most common cause of hyperkyphosis of the thoracic spine during the adolescence period. It causes neck and lower back pain, restriction of lung expansion, traction of the spinal cord, increased vulnerability to vertebral fracture, and a hump. Patients with curves 60° are treated conservatively, while surgery is used for patients with curves &gt; 60°. The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to assess the quality of life and functional changes in conservatively or surgically treated Scheuermann's disease patients with a curve size of 50°-65° in north Jordan. Methods: Sixty-three adolescent patients with Scheuermann's kyphosis (aged between 10 and 18 years) were treated at our hospital between January 2014 and August 2018. All patients were investigated clinically, radiologically (Cobb's angle), and functionally (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI], Scoliosis Research Society 22 revision [SRS-22r] questionnaire, and pulmonary function test [PFT]) pre- and post-treatment (final follow-up). Patients were randomly selected for treatment method (conservative versus surgical). Results: There were 31 patients (mean age, 15.48 ± 2.50 years) and 32 patients (mean age, 16.19 ± 1.51 years) treated conservatively and surgically, respectively. Mean ± standard deviation of ODI, SRS-22r, and Cobb's angle of the surgical group improved from 16.8% ± 14.3%, 3.5 ± 0.5, and 58.75° ± 3.59°, respectively, pre-surgery to 13.4% ± 10.8%, 4.2 ± 0.5, and 41.53° ± 3.94°, respectively, post-surgery, while those of the conservative group became worse from 12.6% ± 13.4%, 3.9 ± 0.7, and 56.1° ± 3.3°, respectively, to 20.1% ± 13.6%, 3.5 ± 0.7, and 58.8° ± 5.8°, respectively. The surgical group showed better improvement in all scores than the conservative group ( p 0.05), as well as in PFT. Conclusions: Surgical treatment of Scheuermann's kyphosis with curves of 50°-65° resulted in better QOL, Cobb's angle, and PFT than conservative treatment. This was because of lower patient cooperation in the conservative management group, which made the curve less flexible for exercises and bracing."
38,2019,35485660,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,"Underwater traction of the spine is a physiotherapeutic method that combines the effects of mechanical traction and fresh water of indifferent temperature and seems promising for the treatment of pain in the lower back, which is due to the physiological basis of the mechanism of action on the spinal motion segment by eliminating muscle spasm and restoring the biomechanics of the spine. Objective: To study the effectiveness of underwater horizontal traction in combination with mechanotherapy in patients with non-stenosing unstable degenerative spondylolisthesis of the lumbosacral spine of the 1st degree, accompanied by pain. Material and methods: The clinical study included 14 patients (mean age 50.21 years). Patients underwent underwater horizontal traction of the spine according to the modified Pushkareva-Vozdvizhenskaya method in a variable mode, the procedures were performed every other day, for a course of 6 procedures. After completion of the traction procedure, patients were recommended to put on a fixing lumbosacral corset, in which they rested for 30 minutes in the supine position. At the end of the rest period, the patients performed training of the back muscles with biofeedback on the mechanotherapeutic complex of simulators for 30 minutes daily, except for weekends, for a course of 10 procedures. Results: All patients completed the course of treatment, during the procedures no side effects or deterioration were noted. During the treatment, motor and daily activity significantly improved according to the Oswestry scale ( p =0.002), the severity of the pain syndrome and its effect on the patient's activity decreased, according to the Roland-Morris questionnaire ( p =0.003). According to an objective assessment of the muscle strength of the lumbosacral spine at the initial level, no deviations from the normative parameters were revealed, however, during the treatment, a significant increase in strength was noted in all muscle groups. Conclusion: Underwater horizontal traction of the spine in variable mode according to Pushkareva-Vozdvizhenskaya is an effective and safe method of conservative treatment of unstable non-stenosing degenerative spondylolisthesis of the 1st degree, accompanied by back pain, which helps to reduce the intensity of the pain syndrome and improve the daily motor and social activity of patients. The traction method should be supplemented with therapeutic exercises using mechanotherapeutic simulators to achieve a clinical result."
38,2019,35286262,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,"Lower back pain and related injuries are prevalent and serious problems in various industries, and high compression force to the lumbosacral (L5/S1) region has been known as one of the key factors. Previous research on passive lower back exoskeletons focused on reducing lumbar muscle activation by providing an extensor moment. Additionally, lumbar traction forces can reduce the compression force, and is a common treatment method for lower back pain in clinics. In this paper, we propose a novel passive lower back exoskeleton that provides both extensor moment and lumbar traction force. The working principle of the exoskeleton, extending the coil springs during lumbar flexion, and its design criteria regarding the amount of each force element were provided. The kinematic model explained its operation, and the dynamic simulation estimated its performance and validated its satisfaction with the design criteria. The biomechanical model provided a brief insight into the expected exoskeleton's effect on the reduced lower back compression force. Ten subjects performed static holding and dynamic lifting tasks, and the generated force elements in two directions, parallel and perpendicular to the trunk, were evaluated using a force sensor and electromyography sensors, respectively. The experiment demonstrated a pulling force opposite to the direction of intradiscal pressure and reduced erector spinae activation. This implies the effect of wearing the exoskeleton to decrease the intervertebral pressure during static back bending or heavy lifting tasks."

Methods: The clinical data of 22 patients with degenerative lumbar diseases underwent OLIF from October 2017 to March 2019 were retrospectively analyzed, including 14 males and 8 females, aged from 51 to 72 years with an average of (63.15±7.22) years. There were 6 cases of lumbar spinal stenosis, 5 cases of lumbar spondylolisthesis, 4 cases of adjacent vertebral disease, 3 cases of degenerative lumbar scoliosis, 3 cases of discogenic low back pain, and 1 case of recurrence after posterior lumbar decompression. Posterior minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation was performed in 13 cases and Stand-alone fixation in 9 cases. Intraoperative blood loss, operation time, postoperative drainage volume, landing time were recorded. The intervertebral disc height(IDH), intervertebral foramen height(IFH), intervertebral foramen area( IFA), canal diameter(CD), canal area(CA) were measured before and after operation. The imaging changes (including location of fusion cage, interbody fusion, and cage subsidence) and complications were observed. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), numerical rating scales (NRS) and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores were compared before and 3, 6, 12 months after operation. Results: All 22 patients successfully completed the operation. The intraoperative blood loss was 25 to 280 ml with an average of (95.45±79.07) ml and that of simple anterior approach was 25 to 70 ml with an average of (45.71±15.42) ml. The operation time was 75 to 210 min with an average of (137.72±37.66) min, and the simple anterior operation time was 75 to 105 min with an average of (91.40±15.96) min. The total drainage volume was 10 to 110 ml with an average of (56.23±31.15) ml, and the time to go down to the ground was 24 to 72 hours (54.48±18.24) hours after operation. Postoperative IDH improved (6.63±2.61)mm( P 0.05), the IFH improved (5.35±2.47)mm ( P 0.05), the IFA improved (97.67±33.58)mm<sup>2</sup>( P 0.05), the CD improved (3.31±1.61) mm( P 0.05), the CA improved (57.52±31.39) mm<sup>2</sup>( P 0.05). Five patients got interbody fusion at 6 months after operation and all 22 patients got interbody fusion at 12 months after operation. There was 5 cases of fusion cage subsidence, all of which occurred in the cases without posterior fixation(using Stand-alone fixation). There was no serious complication such as big blood vessel injury, ureter injury, dural sac injury and nerve root injury. Peritoneal injury occurred in 1 case, postoperative transient thigh pain, decrease of quadriceps femoris muscle strength in 4 cases and sympathetic nerve injury in 1 case. The symptoms of lumbago and radicular pain of lower extremities were alleviated obviously 3 days after operation. The ODI, NRS and JOA scores at 6, 12 months after operation were significantly improved( P 0.05). Conclusion: The treatment of lumbar degenerative diseases with definite indications by OLIF can achieve satisfactory clinical results, and it has advantages of less intraoperative bleeding, fast time to land, less complications, good imaging improvement and indirect decompression. But the operation time and fluoroscopy time are longer in the early stage, and complications such as peritoneal injury and lumbar plexus over traction may occur. The long-term incidence of settlement of fusion cage with Stand-alone technology is higher."
38,2019,33596534,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,"Background: Intervertebral disc degeneration affects the morphology, biomechanics and biochemistry of the disc. The study aimed to compare the effects of compression and traction on lumbar discs measurements in relation to degeneration. Methods: Thirty-five volunteers (30 (SD 11) yrs.) with and without chronic back pain rested supine 15 min before an unloaded T 2 -mapping MRI, were then loaded 20 min with 50% body weight with imaging during the last 5 min, and then repeated this process under traction. For lumbar discs, height, angle, width, mean-T 2 , and T 2 -weighted centroid locations were calculated. A repeated measure ANCOVA and Cohen's d compared loading conditions. Relations between measurement changes between conditions and degeneration assessed by Pfirrmann ratings were examined graphically. Findings: From compression to traction, we observed significant: decrease in L1-2 mean-T 2 (Effect size = -0.35); inferior and posterior shift in L4-5 (0.4, 0.14) and L5-S1 (0.25, 0.33) T 2 -weighted centroid. From unloaded to compression, we observed a significant: increase in L5-S1 width (Effect Size = 0.22); anterior shift in L1-2 T 2 -weighted centroid (0.39); and L3-4 (mean 2.1°) and L4-5 (1.8°) extension angle. More degeneration was graphically related with larger changes from Compression to Traction (more superior and, anterior position of the T 2 -weighted centroid, increased height, reduced extension of segmental angle) and from Unloaded to Compression larger changes in inferior displacement of the T 2 - weighted centroid, decrease in height) but less anterior displacement of the centroid and less change in segmental angles. Interpretation: The largest loading responses were at lower levels, generally with more degeneration. T 2 -weighted centroid locations, angle and disc height detected the largest loading response."

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 78 patients with low back pain and radicular pain admitted to the Department of Orthopedics of Beijing Chuiyangliu Hospital from March, 2017 to April, 2019. Thirty-three of the patients received treatment with LTEB (LTEB group), and 45 received comprehensive conservative treatment including traction, massage, acupuncture and physiotherapy (control group). The demographic and clinical data of the two groups were compared. The patients were followed up for 3 to 24 months, and numerical rating scale (NRS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores of the patients were evaluated before the treatment and at 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after discharge to assess the efficacy of the treatment. Results: The mean operation time of LTEB was 25.7 7.5 min (15-45 min). After the operation, 5 patients developed weakness of the lower limbs but all recovered within 24-72 h. The patients receiving LTEB all showed significantly decreased NRS scores for low back and radicular pain and ODI scores after the operation ( P =0.001). At 2 weeks after the operation, the patients receiving LTEB showed significant relief of low back pain as compared with the patients in the control group ( t =2.224, P =0.034), and the difference in NRS scores for low back pain between the two groups tended to diminish over time ( F =1.743, P =0.183). Treatment with LTEB resulted in obvious relief of radicular pain and significant reduction of the ODI score of the patients ( P 0.001), and such improvements became more obvious over time after LTEB ( P 0.01). Conclusions: As a minimally invasive approach, LTEB is effective for treatment of low back pain with radicular pain and can produce good short-term effects of pain relief and functional improvement."

Methods A total of 81 patients with CLBP were included: experimental group received ITT (n=40) and control group received conservative physical treatment (n=41) 10 times for two weeks. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for measuring low back pain. Results In the experimental group, 26 (out of 40; 65.0%) patients were females, in the control group 20 (out of 41; 48.8%) were females ( p =0.141). In a within-group comparison, median of VAS value was significantly decreased in both groups after ITT. A comparison of pre-intervention and post-intervention VAS value showed no statistically significant difference. Females from the experimental group had a significantly greater decrease of VAS compared with females from the control group. Patients in the ITT group with L5/S1 level of hernia had lower estimated marginal mean of VAS scale compared to the control group, as well the patients with left side of leg pain.

38,2019,33243076,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,"Low back pain is a common, expensive, and disabling condition in industrialized countries. There is still no consensus for its ideal management. Believing in the beneficial effect of traction, we developed a novel external dynamic distraction device. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate that external distraction allows limiting the pressure exerted in standing-up position on the lower intervertebral discs. Numerical and cadaveric studies were used as complementary approaches. Firstly, we implemented the device into a numerical model of a validated musculoskeletal software (Anybody Modeling System) and we calculated the lower disc pressure while traction forces were applied. Secondly, we performed an anatomical study using a non-formalin preserved cadaver placed in a sitting position. A pressure sensor was placed in the lower discs under fluoroscopic control through a Jamshidi needle. The intradiscal pressure was then measured continuously at rest while applying a traction force of 200 N. Both numerical and cadaveric studies demonstrated a decrease in intradiscal pressures after applying a traction force with the external device. Using the numerical model, we showed that tensile forces below 500 N in total were sufficient. The application of higher forces seems useless and potentially deleterious. External dynamic distraction device is able to significantly decrease the intradiscal pressure in a sitting or standing position. However, the therapeutic effects need to be proven using clinical studies."
38,2019,31410565,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,"Introduction: Tethered cord syndrome (TCS) is the progressive development of various neuromuscular dysfunctions caused by the traction of the conus medullaris resulting from congenital or acquired causes, which are often accompanied by fecal and/or urinary incontinence and abnormal sensory motor functions of lower limbs. Lower back pain is a common clinical symptom of TCS patients and can be significantly improved by surgical untethering. However, the specific relationship between the increase in lumbosacral angle and TCS has rarely been reported. Patient: A case of TCS in an 8-year-old girl is reported. The patient had lower back pain complicated by increased lumbosacral angle for more than 20 days. Diagnoses: Physical examination and MRI results showed that the condition of the child has been complicated by TCS. Interventions: After additional relevant examination, surgical untethering of the terminal filum was performed under general anesthesia. Outcomes: The symptoms of lower back pain disappeared, and the plain radiographs indicated that the lumbosacral angle decreased and lumbar lordosis returned to normal. During the follow-up period of half a year, the child did not experience particular discomfort or asymptomatic aggravation. Conclusions: For children with low back pain complicated by lumbosacral angle increase, MRI should be performed to exclude TCS. Once the patient has been diagnosed, early surgical treatment should be provided."
38,2019,29201301,Is lumbar traction an effective treatment for lower back pain?,traction lower back pain,0.0,"Background: The traction bed is a noninvasive device for treating lower back pain caused by herniated intervertebral discs. In this study, we investigated the impact of the traction bed on the lower back as a means of increasing the disc height and creating a gap between facet joints. Methods: Computed tomography (CT) images were obtained from a female volunteer and a three-dimensional (3D) model was created using software package MIMICs 17.0. Afterwards, the 3D model was analyzed in an analytical software (Abaqus 6.14). The study was conducted under the following traction loads: 25%, 45%, 55%, and 85% of the whole body weight in different angles. Results: Results indicated that the loading angle in the L3-4 area had 36.8%, 57.4%, 55.32%, 49.8%, and 52.15% effect on the anterior longitudinal ligament, posterior longitudinal ligament, intertransverse ligament, interspinous ligament, and supraspinous ligament, respectively. The respective values for the L4-5 area were 32.3%, 10.6%, 53.4%, 56.58%, and 57.35%. Also, the body weight had 63.2%, 42.6%, 44.68%, 50.2%, and 47.85% effect on the anterior longitudinal ligament, posterior longitudinal ligament, intertransverse ligament, interspinous ligament, and supraspinous ligament, respectively. The respective values for the L4-5 area were 67.7%, 89.4%, 46.6%, 43.42% and 42.65%. The authenticity of results was checked by comparing with the experimental data. Conclusions: The results show that traction beds are highly effective for disc movement and lower back pain relief. Also, an optimal angle for traction can be obtained in a 3D model analysis using CT or magnetic resonance imaging images. The optimal angle would be different for different patients and thus should be determined based on the decreased height of the intervertebral disc, weight and height of patients."
39,2019,35839363,Can muscle relaxants be used to relieve back pain?,muscle relaxants back pain,1.0,"This article summarizes the top 20 research studies of 2021 identified as POEMs (patient-oriented evidence that matters) that did not address the COVID-19 pandemic. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists prevent adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and also reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Most older adults (mean age, 75 years) with prediabetes do not progress to diabetes. Among patients in this age group with type 2 diabetes treated with medication, an A1C level of less than 7% is associated with increased risk of hospitalization for hypoglycemia, especially when using a sulfonylurea or insulin. For patients with chronic low back pain, exercise, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, duloxetine, and opioids were shown to be more effective than control in achieving a 30% reduction in pain, but self-discontinuation of duloxetine and opioids was common. There is no clinically important difference between muscle relaxants and placebo in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain. In patients with chronic pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports exercise, yoga, massage, and mindfulness-based stress reduction. For acute musculoskeletal pain, acetaminophen, 1,000 mg, plus ibuprofen, 400 mg, without an opioid is a good option. Regarding screening for colorectal cancer, trial evidence supports performing fecal immunochemical testing every other year. For chronic constipation, evidence supports polyethylene glycol, senna, fiber supplements, magnesium-based products, and fruit-based products. The following abdominal symptoms carry a greater than 3% risk of cancer or inflammatory bowel disease: dysphagia or change in bowel habits in men; rectal bleeding in women; and abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, or dyspepsia in men and women older than 60 years. For secondary prevention in those with established arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 81 mg of aspirin daily appears to be effective. The Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations both overestimate the risk of cardiovascular events. Over 12 years, no association between egg consumption and cardiovascular events was demonstrated. Gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and venlafaxine provide clinically meaningful improvements in chronic neuropathic pain. In patients with moderate to severe depression, initial titration above the minimum starting dose of antidepressants in the first eight weeks of treatment is not more likely to increase response. In adults with iron deficiency anemia, adding vitamin C to oral iron has no effect. In children with pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis, or acute otitis media, providing education combined with a take-and-hold antibiotic prescription results in 1 in 4 of those children eventually taking an antibiotic."
39,2019,35754070,Can muscle relaxants be used to relieve back pain?,muscle relaxants back pain,1.0,"As the population ages, spine-related pain is increasingly common in older adults. While medications play an important role in pain management, their use has limitations in geriatric patients due to reduced liver and renal function, comorbid medical problems, and polypharmacy. This review will assess the evidence basis for medications used for spine-related pain in older adults, with a focus on drug metabolism and adverse drug reactions. A PubMed/OVID search crossing common spine, neck, and back pain terms with key words for older adults and geriatrics was combined with common drug classes and common drug names and limited to clinical trials and age over 65 years. The results were then reviewed with identification of commonly used drugs and drug categories: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, corticosteroids, gabapentin and pregabalin, antispastic and antispasmodic muscle relaxants, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tramadol, and opioids. Collectively, 138 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were the focus of the review. The review found a variable contribution of high-quality studies examining the efficacy of medications for spine pain primarily in the geriatric population. There was strong evidence for NSAID use with adjustments for gastrointestinal and renal risk factors. Gabapentin and pregabalin had mixed evidence for neuropathic pain. SNRIs had good evidence for neuropathic pain and a more favorable safety profile than TCAs. Tramadol had some evidence in older patients, but more so in persons aged 65 years. Rational therapeutic choices based on geriatric spine pain diagnosis are helpful, such as NSAIDs and acetaminophen for arthritic and myofascial-based pain, gabapentinoids or duloxetine for neuropathic and radicular pain, antispastic agents for myofascial-based pain, and combination therapy for mixed etiologies. Tramadol can be well tolerated in older patients, but has risks of cognitive and classic opioid side effects. Otherwise, opioids are typically avoided in the treatment of spine-related pain in older adults due to their morbidity and mortality risk and are reserved for refractory severe pain. Whenever possible, beneficial geriatric spine pain pharmacotherapy should employ the lowest therapeutic doses with consideration of polypharmacy, potentially decreased renal and hepatic metabolism, and co-morbid medical disorders."

New evidence on the effects and safety of paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and antidepressants for LBP warrants an updated overview for musculoskeletal clinicians on this topic. Clinical question: How effective and safe are paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and antidepressants compared with placebo for treating LBP? Key results: For acute LBP ( 12 weeks), muscle relaxants and NSAIDs may be superior to placebo for reducing pain, but the effects of opioids, antibiotics, and antidepressants are unknown. Paracetamol provides no additional benefit for acute LBP. For chronic LBP (&gt;12 weeks), NSAIDs, antidepressants, and opioids may be superior to placebo for reducing pain, but opioids have an established profile of harms. Antibiotics may also reduce pain for people with chronic LBP with Modic type 1 changes, although the risks may outweigh their benefits. The effects of paracetamol and muscle relaxants for chronic LBP were unclear. Clinical application: NSAIDs may have a role in managing acute and chronic LBP, with cautious use in people who may be at greater risk of experiencing adverse events. Paracetamol, opioid analgesics, antibiotics, muscle relaxants, and antidepressants should only be prescribed following a discussion between the treating clinician and the patient, considering the risks and possible benefits, and after or in conjunction with recommended nonpharmacological strategies for improving LBP.

Methods: Exploratory retrospective analysis of depersonalized routine data provided by the German Pain e-Registry (GPeR) focusing on pain intensity, pain-related disabilities in daily life, wellbeing, and drug-related adverse events (DRAEs).Primary endpoint based on a global response composite of (a) a clinically relevant analgesic response (relative improvement ≥50% and/or absolute improvement ≥ the minimal clinical important difference) for pain intensity and disability in combination with (b) an improvement in wellbeing (all at end of treatment vs. baseline), and (c) lack of any DRAEs. Results: Between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2020, the GPeR collected information on 121,803 pain patients of whom 1133 (0.9%; 54.5% female, mean ± SD age: 53.9 ± 11.8 years) received add-on PRI for the treatment of (mostly acute) MRP originating predominantly in the (lower) back (43.2%), lower limb (26.4%), or should/neck (21.1%). Average daily dose was 7.8 ± 1.8 (median 9, range 1.5-13.5) mg, duration of treatment 12.0 ± 10.2 (median 7, range 3-63) days. In total, 666 patients (58.8%) reported a complete, 395 (34.9%) a partial, and 72 (6.4%) patients no response - either because of lack of efficacy ( n = 2, 0.2%) or DRAEs ( n = 70, 6.2%). In response to PRI, 41.7% of patients documented a reduction of at least one other pain medication and 30.8% even the complete cessation of any other pharmacological pain treatments. Conclusion: Based on this real-world data of the German Pain e-Registry, add-on treatment with PRI in patients with acute MRP under real-world conditions in daily life was well tolerated and associated with an improvement of pain intensity, pain-related disabilities, and overall wellbeing."

Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Review, Index to Chiropractic Literature, AMED, CINAHL, and PEDro to identify CPGs that described the management of mechanical LBP in the prior five years. Two investigators independently screened titles and abstracts and potentially relevant full text were considered for eligibility. Four investigators independently applied the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument for critical appraisal. Data were extracted for pharmaceutical intervention, the strength of recommendation, and appropriateness for the duration of LBP. Results: 316 citations were identified, 50 full-text articles were assessed, and nine guidelines with global representation met the eligibility criteria. These CPGs addressed pharmacological treatments with or without non-pharmacological treatments. All CPGS focused on the management of acute, chronic, or unspecified duration of LBP. The mean overall AGREE II score was 89.3% (SD 3.5%). The lowest domain mean score was for applicability, 80.4% (SD 5.2%), and the highest was Scope and Purpose, 94.0% (SD 2.4%). There were ten classifications of medications described in the included CPGs: acetaminophen, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, oral corticosteroids, skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs), and atypical opioids. Conclusions: Nine CPGs, included ten medication classes for the management of LBP. NSAIDs were the most frequently recommended medication for the treatment of both acute and chronic LBP as a first line pharmacological therapy. Acetaminophen and SMRs were inconsistently recommended for acute LBP. Meanwhile, with less consensus among CPGs, acetaminophen and antidepressants were proposed as second-choice therapies for chronic LBP. There was significant heterogeneity of recommendations within many medication classes, although oral corticosteroids, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and antibiotics were not recommended by any CPGs for acute or chronic LBP."

These patients are often treated with skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs). Objectives: The goal of this study was to determine whether efficacy of SMRs is associated with age, sex, or baseline LBP severity. Methods: This was a planned analysis of data from 4 randomized studies of patients with acute nonradicular LBP. Patients were enrolled during an ED visit and followed-up 1 week later. The primary outcome was improvement in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) between ED discharge and the 1-week follow-up. We compared the change in RMDQ among 8 groups: placebo, baclofen, metaxalone, tizanidine, diazepam, orphenadrine, methocarbamol, and cyclobenzaprine. All patients also received a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. We performed analysis of variance to determine statistically significant differences between medications and linear regression to determine the association of age, sex, and baseline severity with the primary outcome. Results: The mean improvement in RMDQ per group was placebo 10.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.5-11.5), baclofen 10.6 (95% CI 8.6-12.7), metaxalone 10.3 (95% CI 8.1-12.4), tizanidine 11.5 (95% CI 9.5-13.4), diazepam 11.1 (95% CI 9-13.2), orphenadrine 9.5 (95% CI 7.4-11.5), methocarbamol 8.1 (95% CI 6.1-10.1), and cyclobenzaprine 10.1 (95% CI 8.3-12). The between-group differences were not statistically significantly different. Results were similar regardless of age, sex, and baseline severity. Higher baseline RMDQ was associated with greater clinical improvement (B coefficient 5.7, p 0.01). Adverse medication effects were more common with cyclobenzaprine than with placebo (p 0.01). Conclusions: Among patients in the ED with acute LBP treated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, SMRs do not improve outcomes more than placebo. Neither age, sex, nor baseline impairment impacts these results."

This review provides an overview of the effects of cinnamon on clinical parameters of diabetes and summarizes the molecular mechanisms of action of cinnamon on glucose and lipid metabolism. Search criteria include an electronic search using PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane Library databases. English literature references from 2000 up to 2022 were included. Following title and abstract review, full articles that met the inclusion criteria were included. The results from the available evidence revealed that cinnamon improved glycemic and lipidemic indicators. Clinical trials clarified that cinnamon also possesses an anti-inflammatory effect, which may act beneficially in diabetes. Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, cinnamon seems to elicit the regulation of glucose metabolism in tissues by insulin-mimetic effect and enzyme activity improvement. Furthermore, cinnamon seems to decrease cholesterol and fatty acid absorption in the gut. The current literature search showed a considerable number of studies on diabetic subjects. Some limitations in comparing published data should be highlighted, including variability in doses, extracts and species of cinnamon, administration forms, and antidiabetic therapy."
40,2019,35474577,Can cinnamon help people with diabetes?,cinnamon diabetes,0.0,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a chronic complication of diabetes that emphasizes the urgency of developing new drug therapies. With an illustrious history in traditional medicine to improve diabetes, cinnamon has been shown to possess blood lipids lowering effects and antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the extent to which it protects the diabetic heart has yet to be determined. Forty-eight rats were administered in the study and grouped as: control; diabetic; diabetic rats given 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg cinnamon extract, metformin (300 mg/kg), valsartan (30 mg/kg), or met/val (combination of both drugs), via gavage for six weeks. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) and markers of cardiac injury including creatine kinase-muscle/brain (CK-MB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were evaluated in blood samples. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, the total contents of thiol, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities were measured. Histopathology study and gene expression measurement of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), beta-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were done on cardiac tissue. FBS and cardiac enzyme indicators were reduced in all treated groups. A reduction in MDA level and enhancement in thiol content alongside with increase of SOD and CAT activities were observed in extract groups. The decrease of inflammation and fibrosis was obvious in treated groups, notably in the high-dose extract group. Furthermore, all treated diabetic groups showed a lowering trend in AT1, ANP, β-MHC, and BNP gene expression. Cinnamon extract, in addition to its hypoglycemic and antioxidant properties, can prevent diabetic heart damage by alleviating cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study found that cinnamon extract might protect diabetic heart damage by reducing inflammation and fibrosis in cardiac tissue, in addition to lowering blood glucose levels and increasing antioxidant activity. Our data imply that including cinnamon in diabetic participants' diets may help to reduce risk factors of cardiovascular diseases."

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of aqueous cinnamon extract on postprandial glycemia levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) adults. This clinical trial enrolled 36 adults with DM2, randomly allocated in two groups: the control group ( n = 18) took only an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the intervention group ( n = 18) took OGTT immediately followed by aqueous cinnamon extract (6 g/100 mL) ingestion. Blood glucose levels were measured on fasting and after 30, 60, 90 and 120 min in both groups. The chemical analysis of the aqueous cinnamon extract included total phenols content determination and antioxidant activity assessment through FRAP and DPPH methods. The data reveal that aqueous cinnamon extract ingestion did not show a significant difference in the incremental area under the curve ( p = 0.834), maximum glucose concentration ( p = 0.527) and glucose concentration variation ( p = 0.873) compared with the control group.

40,2019,35098553,Can cinnamon help people with diabetes?,cinnamon diabetes,0.0,"Diabetes is the most common endocrine disorder contributing to high morbidity and mortality globally. Due to the side effects reported for anti-diabetic drugs, there is a rising interest in herbal medicine for diabetes mitigation. However, rare studies were performed to analyze the molecular effects of natural agents on diabetes. Therefore, this study is the first to assess the possible ameliorating effects of avocado and cinnamon extracts on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced disturbances in the gene expression of PDX1 and Ins1 in type-2 diabetic rats, in comparison to metformin. A total number of 50 male Albino rats were randomly divided into five groups; normal control, STZ-induced diabetic group (65 mg/kg b.w divided into three doses 5 days apart), three other STZ-diabetic groups were treated orally for 6 weeks with metformin (500 mg/kg b.w/day), an avocado fruit ethanolic extract (300 mg/kg b.w/day), or a cinnamon aqueous extract (200 mg/kg b.w/day). All rats were fasted overnight then euthanized, blood was collected, and serum was separated for biochemical analyses. The pancreas was processed for the evaluation of PDX1 and Ins1 gene expression by qRT-PCR. Oral administration of the avocado/cinnamon extract significantly improved the altered levels of blood glucose, insulin, lipid profile, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and upregulated the pancreatic expression of PDX1 and Ins1 genes. In conclusion, this study added another mechanism of anti-diabetic action for the plant extracts via upregulating the gene expression of PDX1 and Ins1 in STZ-diabetic rats. Metformin has a more profound effect than the plant extracts; however, cinnamon has a comparable effect. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Diabetes is a worldwide chronic serious problem; therefore, different efficacious drug treatments are currently available. However, several side effects of these drugs also negatively affect patient welfare. Therefore, the present study provides an additive/adjunct biochemical rationale for further natural intervention strategy for type-2 diabetes through the introduction of plant-derived products that revealed a wide range of therapeutic effects without causing untoward actions. This study revealed that cinnamon and avocado extracts exhibited marked anti-diabetic and antioxidant effects in rats, as compared to the standard drug, metformin. These results augmented the previous ones and added a new molecular mechanism of action through upregulation of Ins1 and PDX1 in type-2 diabetic rats."

Diabetes is the underlying cause of many metabolic and tissue dysfunctions, and, therefore, many therapeutic agents have been developed to regulate the glycemic profile. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are a newly developed class of antidiabetic drugs that have potent hypoglycemic effects via several molecular pathways. In addition to synthetic GLP-1 receptor agonists, some evidence suggests that natural products may have modulatory effects on GLP-1 expression and secretion.

One of the recommended treatment strategies in the international evidence-based guidelines is lifestyle modification, which includes diet and exercise, with the aim of improving a range of health outcomes. The incurable nature of PCOS reinforces the importance of developing novel and innovative symptomatic relief strategies, which are currently the only available approaches for improving quality of life for these women. Women with PCOS tend to be nutrient deficient in many common vitamins and minerals, thought to be associated with the psychological (depression, anxiety, etc.) and physiological (insulin resistance, diabetes, infertility, etc.) sequelae of the condition. Nutrient supplementation and the integration of complementary medicine as adjuncts to traditional lifestyle-based therapies in PCOS could therefore provide additional benefits to these women. In this review, we synthesize the evidence regarding nutrient supplementation and complementary therapies in PCOS, predominantly from randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, to provide an overview of the state of knowledge in this field. The evidence to date suggests that specific vitamins (B-12, inositols, folate, vitamins D, E, and K), vitamin-like nutrients (bioflavonoids and α-lipoic acid), minerals (calcium, zinc, selenium, and chromium picolinate), and other formulations (melatonin, ω-3 fatty acids, probiotics, and cinnamon), as well as some complementary approaches such as acupuncture and yoga may be beneficial in PCOS. However, there remain areas of uncertainty and key limitations in the literature that must be overcome before these therapies can be integrated into routine clinical practice."

NPDs have been greatly associated with cardio-metabolic comorbidities such as obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus, dysglycaemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and other cardiovascular disorders. Antipsychotics, which are frontline drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia and off-label use in other NPDs, also add to this burden by causing severe metabolic perturbations. Despite decades of research, the mechanism deciphering the link between neuropsychiatric and metabolic disorders is still unclear. In recent years, transient receptor potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for modulators. TRPA1 agonists/antagonists have shown efficacy in both neuropsychiatric disorders and appetite regulation and thus provide a crucial link between both. TRPA1 channels are activated by compounds such as cinnamaldehyde, allyl isothiocyanate, allicin and methyl syringate, which are present naturally in food items such as cinnamon, wasabi, mustard, garlic, etc. As these are present in many daily food items, it could also improve patient compliance and reduce the patients' monetary burden. In this review, we have tried to present evidence of the possible involvement of TRPA1 channels in neuropsychiatric and metabolic disorders and a possible hint towards using TRPA1 modulators to target appetite, lipid metabolism, glucose and insulin homeostasis and inflammation associated with NPDs."

Probiotics have been shown to help regulate immune responses. Therefore, it is possible that the administration of probiotics to pregnant women could influence the development of the foetal immune system, reducing the likelihood of infants and children developing an allergic condition. The aim of this research was to conduct a systematic review to determine whether administering probiotics to pregnant women can reduce the incidence of allergic disease in their children. Medline, CINAHL and Embase databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared supplementation of probiotics to pregnant women to a placebo control and recorded the presentation of allergic conditions in their children. Data extracted from the study reports included their characteristics and findings. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed. From a total of 850 articles identified in the search, 6 were eligible for inclusion in this review. Two studies found no effect of maternal probiotics on the outcomes measured, two studies found that the incidence of eczema or atopic dermatitis (AD) was reduced by maternal probiotics, one study found no effect on the overall incidence of atopic sensitisation, but a reduction in a subgroup of children at high hereditary risk of allergic disease, and one study found no effect in an intention to treat analysis, but a reduction in AD in complete case analysis. The results of these studies are inconsistent but demonstrate that probiotics may have the potential to reduce infant allergies when administered prenatally, particularly in children at high risk of allergy development. There is a need for further larger-scale studies to be performed in order to provide a more definitive answer. Such studies should focus on at-risk groups."

Data were collected from the literature over the past decade using PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, Ovid, Scopus, and Science Direct. A total of 40 articles were utilized in this review. Collected data indicated that prenatal and post-natal supplementation with lactobacilli alone or lactobacilli with Bifidobacterium spp. seems to be protective. Probiotics may improve insulin resistance and consequently reduce the risk of gestational diabetes. Probiotics may also reduce anxiety and depression by influencing brain activity. Additionally, they interfere with vaginal flora to make it friendlier to beneficial bacteria, and enhance anti-inflammatory or reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines. They may also decrease eczema in breastfed infants and prevent allergic reactions by downregulating Th2 responses to specific allergens from mid to late gestation. Leveraging the cervicovaginal microbiota could promote a number of positive pregnancy-related health outcomes.

This comprehensive review summarizes the clinical studies in infants and children to evaluate the efficacy of this probiotic for pediatric indications. Literature searches for pediatric studies on Biostime<sup>®</sup> or Probiokid<sup>®</sup> (non-commercial name) in 6 international and Chinese databases identified 28 studies, which were classified by indications. Twelve studies show that the probiotic significantly increases the efficacy of standard diarrhea treatment regardless of etiology, reducing the risk of unresolved diarrhea (RR 0.31 [0.23; 0.42]; p 0.0001) by 69%. In eight studies, the probiotic enhanced immune defenses, assessed by levels of various immune competence and mucosal immunity markers (six studies), and reduced the incidence of common infections (two studies). The probiotic improved iron deficiency anemia treatment efficacy (three studies), reducing the risk of unresolved anemia by 49% (RR 0.51 [0.28; 0.92]; p = 0.0263) and significantly reducing treatment side effects by 47% (RR 0.53 [0.37; 0.77]; p = 0.0009).

This chapter gives an overview of existing primary prevention programs on environmental exposures and dietary strategies based on epidemiological studies which have defined risk- and protective factors for the development of allergic diseases.The allergy protective effect mediated by growing up on a traditional farm environment is well studied. But the exact underlying mechanisms have still not been fully clarified and have not yet led to concrete prevention strategies. The beneficial effect of avoiding cigarette smoke exposure, indoor moisture and molds in pregnancy and childhood on the development of asthma is well documented. Whereas the avoidance of house dust mite exposure is not recommended to prevent eczema or allergy. Dietary supplementation with vitamins, pre- and probiotics in pregnant woman and their offspring is not harmful but evidence for the prevention of allergic diseases is still lacking. Fish oil consumption was shown to be asthma protective. The early introduction of peanuts and egg protein to prevent peanut and egg allergy in children with atopic dermatitis is promising. Further studies are needed to increase the overall evidence in allergy prevention. Most studies lack methodological standards such as randomization and blinding. More evidence is in demand on the potential beneficial impact of multifaceted interventional studies. The future of allergy prevention strategies might be based on individual risk assessment.

Parental atopy, particularly AE, is a risk factor for offspring AE, and this risk is augmented both by the number of parental atopic diseases present and the number of affected parents. Low-quality evidence suggests that autumn or winter birth increases childhood AE risk compared with birth in spring. There is some evidence to support filaggrin gene-environment interactions; however, this is limited by small underpowered studies. There is no evidence to suggest that polymorphisms in the -1082, -592 and -819 loci of the interleukin-10 gene increase susceptibility to AE. There is no robust evidence to support a relationship between childhood AE development and either yoghurt consumption in the first year of life, gut microbiota variants, prenatal or infantile paracetamol exposure, maternal antibiotic exposure or air pollution. Three systematic reviews investigated the effect of probiotics given during pregnancy or infancy; although low-quality evidence suggests benefits of combined probiotics, these studies were limited by significant heterogeneity. No relationship between the age at which complementary food and beverages are introduced and the risk of developing AE in infancy was identified. Consistent evidence showed no relationship between human milk feeding and infant AE development, aside from limited evidence suggesting a protective role in those with atopic heredity.

The probiotics group had a significantly lower risk of eczema and atopic eczema compared to controls, especially those treated with probiotic combinations. Mothers' probiotics intake significantly contributed to reducing the risk of eczema as well as atopic eczema. What's more, probiotics seemed effective on eczema prevention ≤2 years of age, but against atopic eczema after 1 of age year. No significant difference in terms of prevention of asthma, rhinitis, wheeze, allergic diseases and sensation. In brief, a probiotic supplement is expected to become a novel potential strategy for infant eczema and atopic eczema."
42,2019,33993140,Are probiotics an effective treatment for eczema?,probiotics eczema,0.0,"Purpose of review: We provide readers with an evidence-informed opinion on current treatments for eczema (atopic dermatitis) with the intention of improving patient care. We suggest five treatment aspects that should be promoted and five that should be demoted. Evidence sources include key randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. Recent findings: Under-treatment of eczema can be countered by more aggressive use of topical therapies including the 'get control then keep control' regimen, and systemics for severe disease, supplemented with good patient education. Topical corticosteroids should be used once daily rather than twice daily. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are useful for sensitive sites. There is little evidence to support the continued use of oral antihistamines, oral or topical antistaphylococcal treatments for infected eczema or probiotics for treating eczema. Nonpharmacological treatments including silk clothing, ion-exchange water softeners and emollient bath additives have not been shown to benefit eczema patients. Despite promising pilot studies, large trials suggest that emollients from birth do not prevent eczema and may result in harms such as increased skin infections and food allergy. Summary: New evidence-based insights on existing and newer treatments allow clinicians the opportunity to change their practice in a way that enhances patients' quality of life."

We aimed to investigate the effect of a mixed strain of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium on eczema in infants under three years old at present; (2) Methods: We searched the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, as well as National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WeiPu (VIP), and WanFang Data (WanFang) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics in the prevention of eczema in infants without language restriction. The main outcome was eczema incidence, while adverse events during the intervention constituted the secondary outcome. The random-/fixed-effects model was utilized to calculate the combined relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The methodological quality of the study was evaluated using the Cochrane ""bias risk"" tool. According to the initial intervention time, subgroup analysis was carried out, follow-up time, family history, etc.; (3) Results: Nine articles were selected (2093 infants). The Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium mixed strain could prevent eczema in infants under three years of age compared to the placebo (RR = 0.60; I<sup>2</sup> = 67%; p 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that the mixture of two probiotic strains had preventive effects on both infants with positive (RR = 0.53; I<sup>2</sup> = 52%; p 0.001) and negative (RR = 0.69; I<sup>2</sup> = 62%; p = 0.02) family history; The follow-up time for ≤12 months (RR = 0.65; I<sup>2</sup> = 12%; p = 0.01) and 12-24 months (RR = 0.60; I<sup>2</sup> = 79%; p = 0.003), daily dose of probiotics ≤ 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> and &gt; 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> colony forming units all can be effective ( p 0.01); Compared with the intervention of infants alone (RR = 0.63; I<sup>2</sup> = 63%; p = 0.29), the effect of probiotics mixture at the beginning of pregnancy was more significant (RR = 0.59; I<sup>2</sup> = 71%; p 0.001); Except for the mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ( LGG ) and Bifidobacterium longum ( B. longum ) ( p = 0.18), other subgroups of intervention group can play a preventive effect ( p 0.05); (4) Conclusions: The mixed strain of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium can effectively reduce the incidence of eczema in infants under three years old. However, further research is needed to fully understand the exact mechanism of their effect on infant eczema."

44,2019,33779528,Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,vitamins epilepsy,0.0,"Background: Anecdotal reports have proposed that diet might influence the occurrence of seizures. Objectives: Our objectives were to assess nutritional status in a sample of patients with epilepsy and to investigate the impact of nutrition on epilepsy control. Patients and methods: One hundred and fifty patients with epilepsy participated in the study. To assess nutritional status, sociodemographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, dietary food intake, and 24-hour food intake were evaluated. Patients answered questions using a food frequency questionnaire. Results: In patients with epilepsy, there was insufficient intake of water, fiber, potassium, magnesium and some vitamins (C, E, B12, folate and niacin); suboptimal intake of calories, zinc, calcium, and some vitamins (A, B1 and B6); optimal intake of total fats; and over-intake of proteins, carbohydrates, phosphorus, iron, sodium, and vitamins D and B2. Moreover, there was a statistically significant difference between patients with controlled versus uncontrolled seizures regarding frequency of vegetable intake and percentage of caloric intake from the recommended dietary allowance. Stepwise logistic regression indicated that those with low intake of vegetables had a 2.3 times higher likelihood of uncontrolled seizure occurrence compared to those with a high intake of vegetables per week. Also, those with optimal caloric intake were 80% less likely to have uncontrolled seizures than those with too much caloric intake. Conclusion: Macro- and micronutrient intake were unbalanced in patients with epilepsy. Patients who consumed too many calories and too few vegetables were more likely to have improper seizure control."

Methods: This study enrolled children and adolescents with refractory epilepsy who were up to 19 y of age. Nutrient intakes were monitored using 3 d food records before introducing micronutrient supplementation and 3 mo after starting KD treatment. The prevalence of micronutrient inadequacy was estimated by sex and age according to the estimated average requirement cutoff values. Results: This study included 39 children and adolescents. The KD did not provide enough content of folate, calcium, and magnesium in all patients according to the dietary reference intake. Even after starting supplementation, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium intake remained inadequate in the majority of patients. The supplementation effectively met the vitamin B 12 recommendation in all age groups. Conclusions: KD treatment did not provide adequate levels of the monitored micronutrients. The supplementation improved but did not prevent the inadequacy of micronutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. The results highlight the importance of individual supplementation protocols and the need to monitor micronutrient intake according to age and sex."

Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 100 epilepsy patients, aged 18 years or older that did not have any physical or psychiatric illness. A patient-administered questionnaire was used to assess their knowledge, attitude towards, practice, and perceived effectiveness (KAPP) of CAM. Established adherence assessment tools were used to determine patient medication adherence. Results: The prevalence of CAM usage was found to be at 58%. CAM was used more frequently by males (n = 32, 60.4%) than by females (n = 26, 55.3%; p = 0.609). The most commonly used CAM included vitamins and minerals (36%), ginseng (16%), antioxidants (15%), and acupuncture (12%). A significant number of patients had low knowledge of (59%) and a positive attitude (54%) toward complementary and alternative medicine. Main reasons for using CAM were a lower price, better availability, and inadequate seizure control by AEDs. About 43% of the patients who used CAM informed their doctor. Prevalence of non-adherence to AED therapy was found to be 68%. A significant association was found between non-adherence and CAM usage (p 0.01). Conclusion: A high prevalence of CAM usage and non-adherence to AEDs among epilepsy patients was identified. CAM usage was associated with a non-adherence to AED therapy. This study highlights the need to explore CAM usage with patients before making clinical decisions to achieve the best outcomes from AED therapy."
44,2019,33497756,Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,vitamins epilepsy,0.0,"Approximately 30% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) present resistance to current pharmacological therapies. There is the possibility that an appropriate nutritional regimen can maintain euthymia. Poor dietary pattern and lack of nutritional knowledge are common among today's population; nutrient-rich foods are being replaced by highly processed foods that lead to a higher risk of developing chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. There is growing evidence of the beneficial role of vitamins and dietary supplements for improving symptoms in a range of affective disorders by regulating the gut microbiome, gut-brain axis, and neurotransmitter levels. Reduced GABA neurotransmission is regularly observed in MDD. Moreover, positive allosteric GABA modulators (i.e benzodiazepines) are widely prescribed to alleviate depression symptoms, but their use needs to be limited, as it can lead to addiction. An alternative option may be the adherence to a ketogenic diet, which consists of low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein, and high-fat intake. It is mainly known for its beneficial role in weight-loss, refractory epilepsy treatment, and balancing glucose levels. A ketogenic diet can also increase GABA levels to aid the mechanism of action of monoaminergic drugs. Thus, it could potentially be used in the treatment for affective disorders due to its potential role in GABA/glutamate balance. While more research is needed before this regimen can be regularly recommended to patients, here we discuss evidence that may encourage physicians to prescribe ketogenic diet as an adjuvant for patients receiving psychotherapy and pharmacology."

Oxidative damage to mitochondria results in disrupted mitochondrial function and cell death signaling, finally triggering diverse pathologies such as epilepsy, a common neurological disease characterized with aberrant electrical brain activity. Antioxidants are considered as promising neuroprotective strategies for epileptic condition via combating the deleterious effects of excessive ROS production in mitochondria. In this review, we provide a brief discussion of the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and evidences that support neuroprotective roles of antioxidants targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress including mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, polyphenols, vitamins, thiols, and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activators in epilepsy. We point out these antioxidative compounds as effectively protective approaches for improving prognosis. In addition, we specially propose that these antioxidants exert neuroprotection against epileptic impairment possibly by modulating cell death interactions, notably autophagy-apoptosis, and autophagy-ferroptosis crosstalk."

Methods: MEDLINE and Scopus from inception to August 25, 2020 were searched for related published manuscripts. The search keywords included ""vitamin or folate or folic acid or biotin or thiamine or carnitine or zinc or manganese or selenium or omega-3 fatty acid or linoleic acid or micronutrient or trace element or supplementation"" AND ""epilepsy or seizure"". Results: We could identify 26 related articles. Seventeen studies provided class 2 of evidence and the rest provided class 3 of evidence. Eight studies investigated polyunsaturated fats, seven groups studied folic acid, four studies explored the effects of vitamin D, two investigated vitamin E, and three others studied multivitamin cocktails. There was one study on zinc and one on selenium. There is some evidence on the efficacy of polyunsaturated fats in treating seizures in PWE. The evidence on the efficacy of multivitamin cocktails in adults is promising. Conclusion: High quality data on the efficacy of nutritional (vitamins-minerals) supplementations in treating seizures in PWE is scarce; however, designing future clinical trials of polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for drug-resistant seizures in adults with focal epilepsy and in children, and also multivitamin supplementations in adults with focal epilepsy seems reasonable and promising. Such clinical trials should be well-designed, randomized, and placebo controlled, with enough sample size and adequate follow-up of 12 months or more."
44,2019,33126389,Can vitamins help manage epilepsy?,vitamins epilepsy,0.0,"Rationale: The ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase synthesis-like (BCS1L) gene is located on chromosome 2 (2q35) and encodes an ATPase that is associated with various cellular activities and is embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane; this ATPase is presumed to facilitate the insertion of the Rieske Fe/S protein into precursors of Complex III (CIII) during the assembly of the respiratory chain. We report the first case of a compound heterozygous mutation in the BCS1L gene in China. Patient concerns: A 7-month-old girl presented with a 3-month history of psychomotor developmental retardation and a 1-month history of epilepsy combined with parallel psychomotor developmental deterioration. The clinical manifestations in the patient included psychomotor developmental retardation, infantile spasms, pili torti, tubulopathy, hepatic pathologies and lactic acidosis. Diagnosis: Combined with her clinical presentation, the patient was diagnosed with CIII deficiency and Björnstad syndrome caused by a novel mutation in the BCS1L gene after molecular biological examination. Whole exome sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous mutation with a missense mutation (c.548G &gt; A/p. R183H) inherited from her mother and an insertion mutation (c.1061_1062insCTA/p. G354delinsGY) inherited from her father. Interventions: Before admission, the patient had received oral topiramate for 1 month. After admission, additional intravenous arginine hydrochloride was administered for five days in the acute metabolic disorder phase, and persistent cocktail therapy was introduced, including coenzyme Q10 (20 mg/d), carnitine (1 g/d) and vitamins (vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, and vitamin C). Outcomes: The spasm seizures were decreased by 50% after 2 weeks of treatment. The blood ammonia, myocardial enzyme and urine glucose levels declined to normal levels. At a 1-month follow-up, the patient improved clinically with a decrease in spasm seizures of 75%, stronger sucking and more voluntary activities. However, she still had mild lactic acidosis and mild hepatic damage. Lessons: We reported the first patient with CIII deficiency and Björnstad syndrome in China and identified 1 novel mutation (C.1061_1062insCTA and P. G354delinsGY) in the BCS1L gene. This finding expands the BCS1L gene mutation profile and will be beneficial for genetic diagnosis."

We aimed to investigate whether the addition of multivitamin therapy (B6/B9, D, E and Q) to regular antiepileptic drug therapy could ameliorate seizures in patients with refractory focal epilepsy. We conducted a prospective cohort open study to investigate the effect and tolerability of add-on multivitamin therapy (daily dose: B6 100 mg, B9 5 mg, D 1000 IU, E 400 IU and coenzyme Q10 100 mg) in patients with intractable focal epilepsy. All patients had effect and safety assessments at baseline and after one, three and six months of the supplementation. Thirty patients (11 men and 19 women) with a mean age of 42.37 ± 9.40 years were recruited and four patients discontinued. The seizure frequency significantly decreased after the six-month supplementation (9.04 ± 18.16/month and 2.06 ± 3.89/month, p = 0.045). At the final visit, 62.5% of the patients showed a ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency, and 12.5% were seizure-free. As to safety and tolerability, most patients did not experience significant adverse events, although three patients reported seizure worsening. In conclusion, this pilot study demonstrated the therapeutic potential and essentially good tolerability of add-on multivitamin therapy in patients with refractory focal epilepsy."

It has both positive and negative effects on the human body, and its activity concerns a variety of systems including the central nervous system, immune system, digestive system, respiratory system, urinary tract, etc. These effects are dependent on quantity, the type of product in which caffeine is contained, and also on the individual differences among people (sex, age, diet etc.). The main aim of this review was to collect, present, and analyze the available information including the latest discoveries on the impact of caffeine on human health and the functioning of human body systems, taking into account the role of caffeine in individual disease entities. We present both the positive and negative sides of caffeine consumption and the healing properties of this purine alkaloid in diseases such as asthma, Parkinson's disease, and others, not forgetting about the negative effects of excess caffeine (e.g., in people with hypertension, children, adolescents, and the elderly). In summary, we can conclude, however, that caffeine has a multi-directional influence on various organs of the human body, and because of its anti-oxidative properties, it was, and still is, an interesting topic for research studies including those aimed at developing new therapeutic strategies."

We used Health Examinee data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (2004-2016). The participants ( n = 3146 with asthma; n = 158,902 non-asthma) were asked about the frequency and amount of their coffee/green tea/soda intake. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for asthma according to the frequency and amount of coffee/green tea/soda intake. Compared to the group consuming no coffee, the aORs for asthma were 0.82 (95% CI = 0.73-0.93, p = 0.002) in the group consuming coffee 1-2 times/day and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.78-0.97, p = 0.011) in the group consuming coffee in quantities of 1 cup, respectively. However, the frequency and amount of green tea and soda consumption were not significantly associated with asthma after adjusting for coffee consumption (all p &gt; 0.05). These findings were consistent in the female subgroup (1-2 times/day: aOR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.66-0.87, p 0.001, and 1 cup each time: aOR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.70-0.90, p 0.001) but not in the male subgroup. Drinking 1 cup of coffee each time and 1-2 times per day may have protective effects against asthma in a Korean population. However, the associations between asthma and green tea/soda cannot be clearly established."
45,2019,32946870,Can caffeine help people with asthma?,caffeine asthma,1.0,"COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for treatment. Despite multiple clinical trials using different agents, there is still a lack of specific treatment for COVID-19. Having the potential role in suppressing inflammation, immune modulation, antiviral and improving respiratory symptoms, this review discusses the potential role of methylxanthine drugs like pentoxifylline and caffeine in the management of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 pathogenesis for clinical features like severe pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) / acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failures are excessive inflammation, oxidation, and cytokine storm by the exaggerated immune response. Drugs like pentoxifylline have already shown improvement of the symptoms of ARDS and caffeine has been in clinical use for decades to treat apnea of prematurity (AOP) in preterm infants and improve respiratory function. Pentoxifylline is well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecules that have already shown to suppress Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α) as well as other inflammatory cytokines in pulmonary diseases, and this may be beneficial for better clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Pentoxifylline enhances blood flow, improves microcirculation and tissue oxygenation, and caffeine also efficiently improves tissue oxygenation, asthma, decreases pulmonary hypertension and an effective analgesic. There are significant shreds of evidence that proved the properties of pentoxifylline and caffeine against virus-related diseases as well. Along with the aforementioned evidences and high safety profiles, both pentoxifylline and caffeine offer a glimpse of considerations for future use as a potential adjuvant to COVID-19 treatment. However, additional clinical studies are required to confirm this speculation."

Our study investigated the prevalence of, and factors associated with asthma. Methods: We analyzed data from the Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey of 44,479 adolescents with physician-diagnosed asthma and 445,692 subjects without asthma. Sociodemographic factors, psychosocial factors, and e-cigarette smoking patterns were investigated by self-report questionnaires. Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate the factors associated with ever or current e-cigarette risks in adolescents with asthma, with adjustment for confounding factors. Results: Significantly more subjects had a smoking habit in the asthma group than in the non-asthma group. Among the adolescents with asthma, 4,420 (9.9%) smoked e-cigarettes (ever-users), and 1,962 (4.4%) smoked e-cigarettes within the last 30 days (current users). Multiple logistic regression showed that both ever and current e-cigarette use were significantly associated with male gender, higher family income, residence in an urban area, alcohol drinking, substance use experience, sexual experience, and friends' smoking. Current e-cigarette use was also significantly associated with high caffeine intake, no regular exercise, and experience of violence in adolescents with asthma. Conclusions: E-cigarette smoking behavior was significantly more frequent in adolescents with asthma than in those without asthma, and multiple psychosocial factors were associated with e-cigarette smoking. Our results could inform e-smoking control programs and help identify adolescents with asthma at high risk of e-cigarette smoking, to ultimately prevent and reduce this behavior."

Methods : We used Simon's Heart Heartbytes National Youth Cardiac Registry to collect data from adolescent athletes in southeastern Pennsylvania. We collected age, race/ethnicity, abnormal cardiac symptoms, medical history, medication use, caffeine intake, and family history. We obtained height, weight, blood pressure, cardiac murmur findings, and ECGs. Echocardiogram was obtained if necessary. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent associations between abnormal cardiac symptoms and collected variables. The odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (95% CI), and p-values were used as statistical values. Results : Of the 887 athletes (543 males and 344 females, age = 16.9 ± 2.1 years, height = 166.9 ± 11.4 cm, weight = 62.0 ± 16.0 kg), 186 (21%) had abnormal cardiac symptoms including chest pain, passing out, difficulty breathing, extreme fatigue, and heart race. There was an independent association between abnormal symptoms and a past medical history (OR: 4.77, 95%CI: 3.18, 7.17, p = 0.001) and medication use (OR: 1.74, 95%CI: 1.08, 2.79, p = 0.022). In medical history, young athletes with asthma showed a greater propensity of abnormal cardiac symptoms (48.9%) compared to young athletes without (14.0%, p = 0.001). Additionally, young athletes with anxiety or depression demonstrated a higher proportion of abnormal cardiac symptoms (48.9%) than those without (19.5%, p = 0.001). Although the association between the presence of abnormal symptoms and African-American race (OR: 2.04, 95%CI: 0.96, 4.35, p = 0.065) and average daily consumption of at least 2 caffeine drinks (OR: 2.08, 95%CI: 0.86, 5.02, p = 0.103) were not significant, there was a trend to reach the a priori significance level. Conclusions : This study identified several clinical parameters that are associated with symptoms suggestive of abnormal cardiac conditions. Larger studies need to be done to better sort out the clinical history that may contribute to false positives to further reduce false positives at heart screenings."

45,2019,30152669,Can caffeine help people with asthma?,caffeine asthma,1.0,"Food allergies are immune-mediated allergic adverse reactions that occur after exposure to specific foods. The most commonly recognized food allergies are immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions (eg, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis) that result from exposure to milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, wheat, or soy. However, other foods can cause food allergies. Oral allergy syndrome is a common but underrecognized condition characterized by transient oropharyngeal symptoms that result from ingestion of uncooked fruits or vegetables. Non-IgE-mediated food allergies manifest with more delayed symptoms than IgE-mediated food allergies, and predominately cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Food allergies often are overreported because they may be confused with food intolerances or nonimmunologic adverse food reactions (eg, lactose intolerance, food poisoning, caffeine intolerance). Food allergies are diagnosed using IgE skin tests, IgE serum tests, or oral food challenge tests. These allergies are best managed by avoidance of the food or foods related to the allergy because they require ingestion rather than contact to precipitate symptoms. Injectable epinephrine should be prescribed for patients at risk of anaphylaxis. Careful food label reading and food preparation, awareness, and education are keys to prevention."

Patient's motor disability results in extreme difficulty to deal with daily activities. Conventional treatment is limited to dopamine replacement therapy, which fails to delay disease's progression and is often associated with a number of adverse reactions. Recent progress in understanding the mechanisms involved in PD has revealed new molecular targets for therapeutic approaches. Among them, caffeine and xanthine derivatives are promising drug candidates, because of the possible symptomatic benefits in PD. In fact, consumption of coffee correlates with a reduced risk of PD. Over the last decades, a lot of efforts have been made to uncover the therapeutic potential of xanthine structures. The substituted xanthine molecule is used as a scaffold for the synthesis of new compounds with protective effects in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, asthma, cancer and others. The administration of the xanthines has been proposed as a non-dopaminergic strategy for neuroprotection in PD and the mechanisms of protection have been associated with antagonism of adenosine A2A receptors and Monoamine Oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibition. The current review summarizes frequently suspected non-dopaminergic neuroprotective mechanisms and the possible beneficial effects of the xanthine derivatives in PD, along with some synthetic approaches to produce perspective xanthine derivatives as non-dopaminergic agents in PD treatment."
45,2019,29474816,Can caffeine help people with asthma?,caffeine asthma,1.0,"Coffee, a complex brew containing hundreds of biologically active compounds, exerts potent effects on long-term human health. Recently, a plethora of studies have been published focusing on health outcomes associated with coffee intake. An inverse association between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality has been seen consistently in large prospective studies. Habitual coffee consumption is also associated with lower risks for cardiovascular (CV) death and a variety of adverse CV outcomes, including coronary heart disease (CHD), congestive heart failure (HF), and stroke; coffee's effects on arrhythmias and hypertension are neutral. Coffee consumption is associated with improvements in some CV risk factors, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), depression, and obesity. Chronic coffee consumption also appears to protect against some neurodegenerative diseases, and is associated with improved asthma control, and lower risks for liver disease and cancer. Habitual intake of 3 to 4 cups of coffee appears to be safe and is associated with the most robust beneficial effects. However, most of the studies regarding coffee's health effects are based on observational data, with very few randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, the possible benefits of coffee drinking must be weighed against potential risks, which are generally due to its high caffeine content, including anxiety, insomnia, headaches, tremulousness, and palpitations. Coffee may also increase risk of fracture in women, and when consumed in pregnancy coffee increases risk for low birth weight and preterm labor."

Purpose: To estimate the prevalence and identify determinants of dry eye symptoms (DES) in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Methods: Using a multi-stage proportionate sampling technique, Saudis of both genders from 6 urban and 4 rural Primary Health Care centers in Al-Ahsa were enrolled. They were interviewed to gather data on sociodemography, symptoms of dry eye, factors potentially related to dry eye, and chronic comorbidities. If one or more of DESs present often or constantly, we labeled the person with DES. Results: We examined 1858 Saudi adults with mean age of 39.3 ± 14.1 years. The age-adjusted prevalence of DES was 32.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 30.0-34.3). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.7-2.6), older age (&gt;56 years; aOR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0-2.1), current smoking (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.8) and history of diabetes mellitus (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.2-2.0) were significantly associated with DES. Nonsignificant variables included residence (urban/rural); work status; wearing contact lenses; multivitamin use; caffeine use; history of trachoma, hypertension, bronchial asthma, coronary artery disease, thyroid disease, arthritis, hemolytic blood diseases (sickle cell-thalassemia), gout, and osteoporosis. Conclusion: DES are highly prevalent among the adult population of Al-Ahsa. Females, persons more than 55 years of age, smokers and diabetics were associated to DES."

Due to the complex nature and variability of MMH and obtrusiveness and subjectiveness of existing hazard analysis methods, providing systematic, continuous, and automated risk assessment is challenging. We present a machine learning algorithm to detect and classify MMH tasks using minimally-intrusive instrumented insoles and chest-mounted accelerometers. Six participants performed standing, walking, lifting/lowering, carrying, side-to-side load transferring (i.e., 5.7 kg and 12.5 kg), and pushing/pulling. Lifting and carrying loads as well as hazardous behaviors (i.e., stooping, overextending and jerky lifting) were detected with 85.3%/81.5% average accuracies with/without chest accelerometer. The proposed system allows for continuous exposure assessment during MMH and provides objective data for use with analytical risk assessment models that can be used to increase workplace safety through exposure estimation."
47,2019,34020879,Can insoles treat back pain?,insoles back pain,0.0,"Background: Increased foot pronation during walking has been associated with low back pain. This association may be due to the impact of increased pronation on pelvic motion. Objective: To investigate the effects of increased bilateral foot pronation on pelvic kinematic in frontal and transverse planes during the loading response phase of gait. Methods: Pelvic, hip, and foot angular positions of 20 participants were collected while they walked at fast speed wearing flat and medially inclined insoles inserted in the shoes. Pelvic motion in frontal and transverse planes was analyzed during the loading response phase. Foot eversion-inversion was analyzed during the complete stance phase to verify the insoles effectiveness in inducing increased pronation and to exclude excessive pronators. Results: Inclined insoles were effective in inducing increased foot pronation. Pelvic and hip motion were altered in the increased pronation condition compared to the control condition. In the frontal plane, mean pelvic position was more inclined to the contralateral side (mean difference [MD]: 0.54°; 95%CI: 0.23, 0.86) and its range of motion (ROM) was reduced (MD: 0.50°; 95%CI: 0.20, 0.79). In the transverse plane, mean pelvic position was less rotated toward the contralateral leg (MD: 1.03°; 95%CI: 0.65, 1.60) without changes in ROM (MD: 0.04°; 95%CI: -0.17, 0.25). The hip was more internally rotated (MD: 1.37°; 95%CI: 0.76, 1.98) without changes in ROM (MD: 0.10°; 95%CI: -1.02, 1.23). Conclusion: Increased bilateral foot pronation changes pelvic motion during walking and should be assessed, as a contributing factor to possible pelvic and lower back disorders."

Seven electronic databases were searched from their inception to May 2020. The methodological quality of the 14 included studies was assessed by PEDro scale. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Moderate evidence on the disability questionnaire score (SMD, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.77; P 0.001) and pain score (SMD, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.85; P 0.001) of the custom-made orthotics for chronic LBP compared with no orthotics/insoles intervention was found. Meta-analysis results also showed moderate evidence on the disability questionnaire score (SMD, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.82; P =0.03) in patients who wore unstable shoes compared with regular shoes. Pain and life quality scores showed low-quality evidence of unstable shoes for chronic LBP. Custom-made orthotics and unstable shoes can be recommended to patients as a management option of chronic LBP."
47,2019,32936288,Can insoles treat back pain?,insoles back pain,0.0,"Background: Mild leg length discrepancy increases biomechanical asymmetry during gait, which leads to low-back pain. Orthotic insoles with a directly integrated heel lift were used to reduce this asymmetry and thus the associated low-back pain. The aim of this study was to analyze the biomechanical adaptations of the locomotor apparatus during gait and the subjective pain ratings before and after the establishment of orthotic insole use. Methods: Eight patients with mild leg length discrepancy (≤2.0 cm) underwent three-dimensional biomechanical analysis while walking before and after 3 weeks of orthotic insole use. Low-back pain was assessed separately before both measurement sessions using a visual analog scale. Results: Analysis of the kinematic parameters highlighted individual adaptations. The symmetry index of Dingwell indicated that orthotic insoles had no significant effect on the kinematic gait parameters and an unpredictable effect across patients. Orthotic insole use significantly and systematically (in all of the patients) reduced low-back pain (P .05), which was correlated with changes in ankle kinematics (P = .02, r = 0.80). Conclusions: The effects of orthotic insoles on gait symmetry are unpredictable and specific to each patient's individual manner of biomechanical compensation. The reduction in low-back pain seems to be associated with the improved ankle kinematics during gait."
47,2019,32817709,Can insoles treat back pain?,insoles back pain,0.0,"Background: Pes planus (flatfoot) is a common deformity characterized by the midfoot arch collapses during walking. As the midfoot is responsible for shock absorption, persons with flatfoot experience increased risk of injuries such as thumb valgus, tendinitis, plantar fasciitis, metatarsal pain, knee pain, lower-back pain with prolonged uphill, downhill, and level walking, depriving them of the physical and mental health benefits of walking as an exercise. Methods: Fifteen female college students with flatfoot were recruited. A wireless plantar-pressure system was used to measure the stance time, cadence, plantar pressure, and contact area. Parameters were compared between wearing flat and arch-support insoles using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with on an incline, decline, and level surface, respectively. The significance level α was set to 0.05. The effect size (ES) was calculated as a measure of the practical relevance of the significance using Cohen's d. Results: On the level surface, the stance time in the arch-support insole was significantly shorter than in the flat insole (p 0.05; ES = 0.48). The peak pressure of the big toe in the arch-support insole was significantly greater than in the flat insole on the uphill (p 0.05; ES = 0.53) and level surfaces (p 0.05; ES = 0.71). The peak pressure of the metatarsals 2-4 and the contact area of the midfoot in the arch-support insole were significantly greater than in the flat insole on all surfaces (all p 0.05). Conclusions: These results imply that wearing an arch-support insole provides benefits in the shortened stance time and generation of propulsion force to the big toe while walking on uphill and level surfaces and to the metatarsals 2-4 while walking on the level surface. More evenly distributed contact areas across the midfoot may help absorb shock during uphill, downhill and level walking."
47,2019,32787369,Can insoles treat back pain?,insoles back pain,0.0,"Rearfoot disorders are frequently encountered in clinical practice. We reviewed common rearfoot disorders and present conservative treatments, focusing on shoe modification and the application of insoles or orthoses. Achilles tendinopathy is caused by excessive mechanical loads on the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Heel lifts, rocker shoes, and the AirHeel Brace can be used to reduce symptoms. Haglund's deformity is an osseous prominence of the posterosuperior part of the calcaneus bone, the pain from which can be alleviated by reducing pressure on the affected area by appropriately modifying the back of the shoe to prevent contact with the lesion. The pain from retrocalcaneal bursitis can be controlled by lifting the heel and loosening the shoe counter. Plantar fasciitis causes plantar heel pain, and its orthotic treatments include the application of a heel cup, heel pad, heel wedge, Thomas heel, and night splint. Calcaneal stress fractures are generally caused by repetitive loads and occur mainly in sporting activities. Patellar tendon-bearing (PTB) orthoses are helpful in reducing the load on the calcaneal bone. Heel fat pad atrophy refers to the loss of the fat pad that absorbs shock in the heel. To reduce pain caused by heel fat pad atrophy, rocker soles, heel pads, and solid ankle cushion heels (SACHs) may be used. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the tibial nerve within the tarsal tunnel and its symptoms can be managed by rocker soles, supporting medial arches, Thomas heels, and SACHs. Shoe modification or application of orthoses can be helpful for managing rearfoot pain. However, for the active and wide application of these conservative treatment methods, more clinical studies should be conducted."
47,2019,32677928,Can insoles treat back pain?,insoles back pain,0.0,"Background: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) has been associated with diminished postural stability and a greater prevalence of back pain. Currently, the literature is lacking information on the effect of spinal fusion on both postural stability and its association with back pain. Our objectives were to evaluate the postsurgical effect of spinal morphological changes on static standing balance and assess the influence of these alterations on reported pain throughout the perioperative period. Methods: Twenty consecutive AIS patients schedule to undergo spinal fusion surgery were recruited and followed prospectively at the Shriners Hospitals for Children-Canada. Data was collected at the preoperative, 6 weeks and 6 months postoperative visits. Spinal morphology data was collected through 3D reconstructed simultaneous standing biplanar radiographs using the SterEOS software. Postural balance was assessed through Moticon© sensor insoles and analyzed through their software. The data was simultaneously collected as part of the Global Biomechanical and morphological Assessment. Pain was evaluated through self-reported questionnaires. Results: Morphological curve parameters were significantly reduced after surgery. Balance parameters did not change significantly throughout the perioperative period with the exception of the Center of Pressure of the left foot medial/lateral transient shift (P = 0.017) at 6 weeks. Of note, preoperative balance parameters were associated with the degree of right thoracic Cobb angles (P = 0.029 R = 0.528). Pain scores significantly improved 6 weeks and 6 months after the surgery. Pain intensity diminished in the thoracic and lumbar spine but worsen in the neck region at the 6 weeks and 6 months postoperative time points (P = 0.044). Greater residual Cobb angle difference between Mid thoracic and Thoracolumbar/Lumbar curves was associated with greater pain severity at 6 weeks postop (P 0.005). In addition, greater residual thoracic deformity was associated with significant pain severity 6 months after surgery (P 0.05). Conclusions: Improved spinal morphology of postsurgical AIS patients has no significant impact on their static standing balance. Suggesting that other factors apart from the spinal morphology may contribute to AIS patients' balance during stance. Although balance did not influence pain severity, spinal morphology and its correction appear to have influenced the intensity and location of back pain."

The common treatment is to use a shoe lift on the shorter leg side, but this has unsatisfying results. Objective: Through research and development, we created 3D printing orthotic insoles for LLD patients and aimed to improve their symptoms. Methods: 1. Research and development of 3D printing orthotic insole: (1) foot scan and data acquisition; (2) insole software modeling; (3) 3D printing insole using TPU materials, and (4) post-processing. 2. Clinical observation: we customized insoles for LLD patients and required them to wear them while walking. We conducted general inquiries and a functional evaluation before and after 12 weeks of wearing insoles. Results: There are seven complete cases. The joint and lower back pains were alleviated. The stride frequency, stride and pace were improved in all seven cases. Patients' overall health condition improved significantly. Conclusions: The 3D printing orthotic insoles are made with clear procedures and practical operability. By wearing insoles, patients' muscle and/or joint pains were relieved and their gaits were improved."

LBP is common and causes a remarkable health burden worldwide. Leg-length discrepancy (LLD) is potentially a risk factor for development of LBP, although this relationship has been questioned. Yet only one randomized controlled study (RCT) has been performed. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of insoles with leg-length discrepancy (LLD) correction compared to insoles without LLD correction among meat cutters in a RCT-design. Methods: The study population consisted 387 meat cutters who were over 35 years old and had been working 10 years or more. The LLD measurement was done by a laser ultrasound technique. All workers with an LLD of at least 5 mm and an LBP intensity of at least 2 on a 10-cm Visual Analog Scale were eligible. The LLD of all the participants in the intervention group was corrected 70%, which means that if the LLD was for example 10 mm the correction was 7 mm. The insoles were used at work for eight hours per day. The control group had insoles without LLD correction. The primary outcome was between-group difference in LBP intensity. Secondary outcomes included sciatic pain intensity, disability (Roland Morris), RAND-36, the Oswestry Disability Index, physician visits and days on sick leave over the first year. We used a repeated measures regression analysis with adjustments for age, gender and BMI. The hurdle model was used for days on sick leave. Results: In all, 169 workers were invited and 114 (67%) responded. Of them, 42 were eligible and were randomized to the intervention (n = 20) or control group (n = 22). The workers in the intervention group had a higher improvement in LBP intensity (- 2.6; 95% confidence intervals - 3.7 - - 1.4), intensity of sciatic pain (- 2.3; - 3.4 - - 1.07) and RAND-36 physical functioning (9.6; 1.6-17.6) and a lesser likelihood of sick leaves (OR -3.7; - 7.2 - -0.2).

47,2019,30121110,Can insoles treat back pain?,insoles back pain,0.0,"Introduction: We conducted an overview of systematic reviews of interventions for the prevention of low back pain (LBP) that can be conducted in a workplace setting. Methods: An electronic literature search was performed in Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Published peer-reviewed systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which described interventions for the primary or secondary prevention of LBP applicable to a workplace setting, were eligible for inclusion. The methodological quality of the included systematic reviews was assessed with the AMSTAR tool. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of LBP; secondary outcomes were LBP-associated absenteeism, activity interference, and costs related to LBP. Results: Twenty-eight eligible articles published between 1994 and 2016 were included in a qualitative synthesis following our screening of abstracts and full-text articles. The AMSTAR rating revealed 14 reviews of high, 10 of moderate, and 4 of low methodological quality. The identified interventions included workplace modifications (6 reviews, 10 studies, 6,751 subjects); shoe insoles (4 reviews, 6 studies, 2,356 subjects); and lumbar supports and other assistive devices (15 reviews, 18 studies, 60,678 subjects). Educational interventions investigated were back schools (10 reviews, 30 studies, 9,973 subjects); manual material handling techniques/advice (6 reviews, 24 studies, 10,505 subjects); and other forms of instruction including pamphlets, booklets, and other media (four reviews, 14 studies, 11,991 subjects). Exercise interventions, investigated in 12 reviews (35 studies, 19,330 subjects), showed moderate quality evidence of effectiveness for exercise interventions alone or in conjunction with educational interventions; no other type of intervention was consistently effective in the prevention of LBP or LBP-associated outcomes of interest. Conclusions: Our overview provides evidence of effectiveness for exercise with or without educational interventions in the prevention of LBP. Practical applications: Exercise interventions with or without educational interventions that can be applied in the workplace have the potential to prevent LBP."

RA patient plasma causes pro-atherogenic derangements in cholesterol transport leading to macrophage foam cell formation (FCF). The TARGET randomized clinical trial compares CV benefits of 2 RA drug regimens. Hydoxychloroquine (HCQ) is a key medication used in TARGET. This study examines effects of HCQ on lipid transport to elucidate mechanisms underlying TARGET outcomes and as an indicator of likely HCQ effects on atherosclerosis in RA. Materials and Methods : THP1 human macrophages were exposed to media alone, IFNγ (atherogenic cytokine), HCQ, or HCQ + IFNγ. Cholesterol efflux protein and scavenger receptor mRNA levels were quantified by qRT-PCR and corresponding protein levels were assessed by Western blot. FCF was evaluated via Oil-Red-O and fluorescent-oxidized LDL. Intracellular cholesterol and efflux were quantified with Amplex Red assay. Results : With the exception of a decrease in the efflux protein cholesterol 27-hydroxylase in the presence IFNγ at all HCQ concentrations, no significant effect on gene or protein expression was observed upon macrophage exposure to HCQ and this was reflected in the lack of change in FCF and oxidized LDL uptake. Conclusions : HCQ did not significantly affect THP1 macrophage cholesterol transport. This is consistent with TARGET, which postulates superior effects of anti-TNF agents over sulfasalazine + HCQ."
49,2019,36068476,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder that can lead to severe joint damage and is often associated with a high morbidity and disability. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the mainstay of treatment in RA. DMARDs not only relieve the clinical signs and symptoms of RA but also inhibit the radiographic progression of disease and reduce the effects of chronic systemic inflammation. Since the introduction of biologic DMARDs in the late 1990s, the therapeutic range of options for the management of RA has significantly expanded. However, patients' response to these agents is not uniform with considerable variability in both efficacy and toxicity. There are no reliable means of predicting an individual patient's response to a given DMARD prior to initiation of therapy. In this chapter, the current published literature on the pharmacogenetics of traditional DMARDS and the newer biologic DMARDs in RA is highlighted. Pharmacogenetics may help individualize drug therapy in patients with RA by providing reliable biomarkers to predict medication toxicity and efficacy."

The heterogeneous clinical presentation of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome gives rise to a broad differential diagnosis that includes a multitude of infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune conditions. This patient was diagnosed with drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome 4 weeks after starting sulfasalazine and 5 weeks after starting hydroxychloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis. Both of these medications have been shown to cause drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, albeit more rarely in the context of hydroxychloroquine. This patient's history, physical examination, and workup illuminate a case of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome that masquerades as a lymphoproliferative disorder despite its adherence to the RegiSCAR criteria. Case presentation: A 22-year-old African-American female with an atopic history and rheumatoid arthritis presented for evaluation of a rash, unremitting fevers, and syncope. She was found to have drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome. A syncope workup was unremarkable. Computed tomography of the chest/abdomen/pelvis confirmed extensive lymphadenopathy and revealed a small right pleural effusion (Fig. 5). These imaging findings accompanied by fevers and a rash in the setting of eosinophilia, leukocytosis, and transaminitis led to the clinical suspicion for drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome. Steroids were subsequently initiated. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was implemented to cover for possible skin/soft tissue infection due to initial paradoxical worsening after discontinuation of the culprit drugs. Lymph node biopsy ruled out a lymphoproliferative disorder and instead demonstrated necrotizing lymphadenitis. An extensive infectious and autoimmune workup was noncontributory. Clinical improvement was visualized, antibiotics were discontinued, and she was discharged on a steroid taper. Conclusion: This case reflects how drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome can masquerade as a lymphoproliferative disorder. Additionally, it highlights the extent to which rapid identification and treatment optimized the patient's outcome. It calls into question how immunogenetics may factor into a patient's susceptibility to acquire drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome. This case is unique because of the early onset of visceral organ involvement, the type of internal organ involvement, the hematopoietic features, and the lymphadenopathy associated with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug."

The expression of TAM TKs in the synovial fluid and synovial tissues of RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients was measured by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. The relationships between soluble TAM TKs (sTAM TKs) levels and the clinical features, laboratory parameters and disease activity were analyzed in RA. The concentrations of sTAM TK in the synovial fluids of RA patients were increased in comparison to those of OA patients. Compared with OA patients, the expression of membrane Tyro3 TK (mTyro3 TK) and mMer TK in RA patient synovial tissue were significantly increased, which may partly explain the possible mechanism of elevated levels of sTAM TK in RA patient synovial fluid. sAxl TK levels were decreased in RA patients under sulfasalazine treatment and elevated in patients under Iguratimod treatment. Furthermore, sTyro3 TK levels were positively correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and negatively correlated with white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), and hemoglobin (HB) in RA patients. The levels of sMer TK were positively associated with disease duration and rheumatoid factor (RF) and negatively correlated with HB, complement 3 (C3), and C4. Taken together, TAM TKs might be involved in RA synovial tissue inflammation."

In addition, machine learning algorithms were trained to predict remission. Ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms were investigated. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate associations between genetic polymorphisms and the efficacy of TNF-α inhibitors. A random forest-based classification approach was used to assess the importance of different variables associated with the efficacy of TNF-α inhibitors. Various machine learning methods were used for finding vital factors and prediction of remission. The eight most significant features included in the multivariable analysis were sex, age, hypertension, sulfasalazine, rs1862513, rs3219178, rs3219177, and rs3745369. T-allele carriers of rs3219177 and males showed approximately 6.0- and 3.6-fold higher remission rates compared to those with the CC genotype and females, respectively. The elastic net algorithm was the best machine-learning method for predicting remission of patients with RA treated with TNF-α inhibitors. On the basis of the results of this study, it may be possible to design individually tailored treatment regimens to predict the efficacy of TNF-α inhibitors."

This study aims to assess persistence with sulfasalazine and also frequency and severity of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) encountered with this very well-established disease-modifying anti-rheumatoid drug. Materials and methods: This retrospective study was done in 1,114 patients from medicine and rheumatology outpatient departments of six centers across India. The inclusion criteria was patients taking sulfasalazine. Patients receiving sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis or spondyloarthritis were selected and details on drugs used, duration of taking sulfasalazine, ADRs to sulfasalazine and whether sulfasalazine had to be stopped due to ADRs were analyzed. Results: Of the total of patients included in the study, 10.1% had ADRs with sulfasalazine, and stopped the drug. Gastritis, deranged liver enzymes, hepatitis, skin rashes were the most commonly encountered ADRs. Of the total number of patients recruited for the study, 11% were lost to follow-up, as most of the centers were army hospitals and the officers and staff were posted to other places. Sulfasalazine was taken for less than 1 month by 3.8% patients while 12.5% had taken the drug for less than 6 months. Of the study patients, 28.6% had taken the drug for 24 - 60 months and 4.6% (51 patients) had taken it for more than 5 years. It was found that ADRs were most commonly encountered within the first year of using the drug, and persistence was seen in patients on long-term therapy. Conclusion: Sulfasalazine is a safe option in chronic therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis. Although frequency of ADRs with patients taking sulfasalazine is minimal, it did necessitate the stoppage of drug. If not well tolerated, sulfasalazine would not have been continued for more than 12 months as evidenced from this study."

Using observational data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register (SRQ), between 2006 and 2020, we emulated the protocol of the Swedish Farmacotherapy trial (SWEFOT) and compared the results. SWEFOT was a pragmatic trial nested in SRQ, between 2002 and 2005, where methotrexate (MTX) insufficient responders were randomized to receive additional infliximab or sulfasalazine (SSZ) + hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Patients with RA initiating infliximab (N = 313) or SSZ + HCQ (N = 196) after MTX were identified in SRQ and the Prescribed Drugs Register, mimicking the SWEFOT eligibility criteria. The primary outcome was the proportion of European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) good responders at 9 months, classifying patients who discontinued treatment as ""nonresponders."" Through sensitivity analyses, we assessed the impact of relaxing eligibility criteria. The observed proportions reaching EULAR good response were close to those reported in SWEFOT: 39% (vs. 39% in SWEFOT) for infliximab and 28% (vs. 25%) for SSZ + HCQ. The crude observed response ratio was 1.39 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.86), increasing to 1.48 (95% CI 0.98-2.24) after confounding adjustment, compared to 1.59 (95% CI 1.10-2.30) in SWEFOT. Results remained close to SWEFOT when relaxing eligibility criteria until allowing prior disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) use which reduced the observed difference between treatments. By applying a prespecified trial emulation protocol to observational clinical registry data, we could replicate the results of SWEFOT, favoring infliximab over SSZ + HCQ combination therapy at 9 months."
49,2019,35441682,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and young adults, with a very poor prognosis. It is of great importance to develop targeted therapeutic strategies for osteosarcoma. Sulfasalazine (SAS) is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. It acts as an inhibitor of cystine/glutamate system, which is important for cellular glutathione synthesis and maintenance of GPx4 activity. Nowadays, SAS has been repurposed as an antitumor drug for inducing ferroptosis in cancers. This study aimed to uncover the role of iron in SAS-induced ferroptotic cell death in K7M2 osteosarcoma cells. Herein, SAS led to an iron-dependent cell death mode in K7M2 cells, accompanied with decreased antioxidant defense and increased production of cytosolic and lipid reactive oxygen species. Results also showed that iron supplement with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) or ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) exacerbated the declined cell viability of SAS-treated K7M2 cells, while in the case of iron depletion, it weakened such suppression. Furthermore, iron promoted SAS-induced alterations on cell cycle, cytoskeleton, mitochondria morphology and function, and redox system. Iron also induced the dysfunction of autophagic activity in SAS-treated K7M2 cells. In conclusion, our study uncovered the essential role of iron in SAS's effects on K7M2 cells and provided the potential combined therapy of inhibition on antioxidant defense and an increase in oxidative potential, which further disturbed the redox status in tumor cells."
49,2019,35369881,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,"Background: Overlap syndromes account for about 25% of autoimmune diseases. They are many possible combinations of known autoimmune diseases increasingly diagnosed with the identification of of a large number of autoantibodies. In this case report, we present a patient with rare overlapping rheumatoid arthritis-antisynthetase syndrome with associated secondary Sjögren's syndrome atypically presenting without interstitial lung disease. Case presentation: A 52-year-old Sinhalese female, a known patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus, presented with a history of symmetrical inflammatory-type polyarthritis with significant morning stiffness, proximal muscle weakness, pain, and roughening of the fingertips with associated sicca symptoms of 5 months duration. Examination revealed features of active joint inflammation, mechanic's hand, xerostomia, and left-sided breast lump. Investigations confirmed the presence of rheumatoid arthritis with strongly positive rheumatoid factor (202 U/ml) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (717 U/ml). Antisynthetase syndrome was also diagnosed with borderline-positive anti-aminoacyl-tRNA antibodies but without interstitial lung disease. Sjögren's syndrome was confirmed by the clinical history and histology and considered a secondary disorder. As her breast lump proved to be benign, no further interventions were done. She was started on sulfasalazine and methotrexate with steroid bridging therapy and achieved remission and had good control of the disease without any joint deformity or flare-up on 6-month clinic follow-up. Discussion: Overlapping rheumatoid arthritis-antisynthetase syndrome is a very rare disease with disabling complications. Early identification of the atypical presentations of the overlap syndromes, by thorough investigations, helps physicians to prescribe proper disease-modifying antirheumatoid drugs and biological drugs. It also helps predict the prognosis of the patients before they develop complications."
49,2019,35288173,Is sulfasalazine an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis?,sulfasalazine rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,"Aims: Due to traditional endocrinological techniques, there is currently no shared work available, and no therapeutic choices have been presented in type 2 diabetes (T2D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and tuberculosis (TB). The purpose of this research is to summarize the prospective molecular complications and potential therapeutic targets associated with T2D that have been connected to the development of TB and RA. Materials and methods: We collected the transcriptomic data as GSE92724, GSE110999 and GSE 148036 for T2D, RA and TB patients. After collecting from NCBI, then GREIN were employed to process our datasets. STRING and Enrichr were used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI), gene regulatory network (GRN), protein-drug-chemical, gene ontology and pathway network. Finally, Cytoscape and R studio were employed to visualize our proposed network. Key findings: We discovered a number of strong candidate hub proteins in significant pathways, namely RAB25, MAL2, SFN, MYO5B, and HLA-DQB1 out of 75 common genes. We also identified a number of TFs (JUN, TFAP2A, FOXC1, and GATA2); miRNA (mir-1-3p, mir-16-5p, and mir-34a5p); drugs (sulfasalazine, cholic acid, and nilflumic acid) and chemicals (Valproic acid, and Aflatoxin B1) may control DEGs in transcription as well as post- transcriptional expression levels. Significance: To summarize, our computational techniques discovered unique potential biomarkers that show how T2D, RA, and TB interacted, as well as pathways and gene regulators by which T2D may influence autoimmune inflammation and infectious diseases. In the future, more clinical and pharmacological research is needed to confirm the findings at the transcriptional and translational levels."
50,2019,36215261,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,"Background: A wish for improved health or avoidance of ill health is often given as reason for wanting to undergo bariatric surgery. How such reasons relate to postoperative outcome is unclear. Objective: The aim was to explore Swedish patients' reasons for undergoing bariatric surgery. Also, we wanted to analyze if there were sex and age differences and associations with weight loss and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Settings: This was a single-center study conducted at a university hospital. Method: Data on 688 patients (528 women and 160 men) including a free text response was analyzed inductively and deductively using predefined statements and was merged with data from the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry. All data was analyzed using descriptive and analytic statistics. Result: The most common reason for undergoing bariatric surgery was pain in different body parts. A wish for an improved medical condition was reported by most patients (59%, n = 408), followed by physical limitations making daily life difficult (42%, n = 288). Men and women reported similar reasons. Younger patients were more distressed about physical appearance (p = 0.001) and older patients wanted to improve their medical condition (p = 0.013). Health-related quality of life improved irrespective of reasons for undergoing surgery. Conclusion: The most reported reasons for undergoing bariatric surgery were a wish for improved medical condition and to make daily life easier. Factors associated with the decision for surgery showed that there were few sex differences, but age seemed to be a factor. The HRQoL trajectory showed improvement regardless of reasons for undergoing surgery."
50,2019,36209245,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,"Background: Bariatric surgery has adverse effects on the muscular-skeletal system with loss of bone mass and muscle mass and an increase in the risk of fracture. Zoledronic acid is widely used in osteoporosis and prevents bone loss and fracture. Bisphosphonates may also have positive effects on skeletal muscle. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of zoledronic acid for the prevention of bone and muscle loss after bariatric surgery. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. Sixty women and men with obesity aged 35 years or older will complete baseline assessments before randomization to either zoledronic acid (5 mg in 100 ml isotonic saline) or placebo (100 ml isotonic saline only) 3 weeks before surgery with Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Follow-up assessments are performed 12 and 24 months after surgery. The primary outcome is changes in lumbar spine volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) assessed by quantitative computed tomography (QCT). Secondary bone outcomes are changes in proximal femur vBMD assessed by QCT. Changes in cortical and trabecular bone microarchitecture and estimated bone strength will be assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Cortical material bone strength at the mid-tibia diaphysis will be assessed using microindentation and fasting blood samples will be obtained to assess biochemical markers of bone turnover and calcium metabolism. Secondary muscle outcomes include whole body lean mass assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Dynamometers will be used to assess handgrip, shoulder, ankle, and knee muscle strength. Short Physical Performance Battery, 7.6-m walking tests, 2-min walking test, and a stair climb test will be assessed as biomarkers of physical function. Self-reported physical activity level is assessed using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).

Materials and methods: This was a multicenter cross-sectional study performed at 17 hospitals in several regions of Brazil. From 2015 to 2019, transvaginal ultrasound scan was performed in women with singleton pregnancies at 18 0/7 to 22 6/7 weeks of gestation to measure the CL. We analyzed CL regarding its distribution and the risk factors for CL ≤25 mm using logistic regression. Results: The percentage of CL ≤ 25mm was 6.67%. Shorter cervices, when measured using both straight and curve techniques, showed similar results: range 21.0-25.0 mm in straight versus 22.6-26.0 mm in curve measurement for the 5th percentile. However, the difference between the two techniques became more pronounced after the 75th percentile (range 41.0-42.0 mm straight x 43.6-45.0 mm in curve measurement). The risk factors identified for short cervix were low body mass index (BMI) (OR: 1.81 CI: 1.16-2.82), higher education (OR: 1.39 CI: 1.10-1.75) and personal history ([one prior miscarriage OR: 1.41 CI: 1.11-1.78 and ≥2 prior miscarriages OR: 1.67 CI: 1.24-2.25], preterm birth [OR: 1.70 CI: 1.12-2.59], previous low birth weight 2500 g [OR: 1.70 CI: 1.15-2.50], cervical surgery [OR: 4.33 CI: 2.58-7.27]). By contrast, obesity (OR: 0.64 CI: 0.51-0.82), living with a partner (OR: 0.76 CI: 0.61-0.95) and previous pregnancy (OR: 0.46 CI: 0.37-0.57) decreased the risk of short cervix. Conclusions: The CL distribution showed a relatively low percentage of cervix ≤25 mm. There may be populational differences in the CL distribution and this as well as the risk factors for short CL need to be considered when adopting a screening strategy for short cervix."

Objective: To examine the association between bariatric surgery and CVD risk in individuals with severe obesity and NAFLD. Design, setting, and participants: This large, population-based retrospective cohort study obtained data from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2017. Participants included insured adults aged 18 to 64 years with NAFLD and severe obesity (body mass index ≥40) without a history of bariatric surgery or CVD before NAFLD diagnosis. Baseline characteristics were balanced between individuals who underwent surgery (surgical group) and those who did not (nonsurgical group) using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Data were analyzed from March 2020 to April 2021. Exposures: Bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and other bariatric procedures) vs nonsurgical care. Main outcomes and measures: The main outcome was the incidence of cardiovascular events (primary or secondary composite CVD outcomes). The primary composite outcome included myocardial infarction, heart failure, or ischemic stroke, and the secondary composite outcome included secondary ischemic heart events, transient ischemic attack, secondary cerebrovascular events, arterial embolism and thrombosis, or atherosclerosis. Cox proportional hazards regression models with inverse probability treatment weighting were used to examine the associations between bariatric surgery, modeled as time varying, and all outcomes. Results: The study included 86 964 adults (mean [SD] age, 44.3 [10.9] years; 59 773 women [68.7%]). Of these individuals, 30 300 (34.8%) underwent bariatric surgery and 56 664 (65.2%) received nonsurgical care. All baseline covariates were balanced after applying inverse probability treatment weighting. In the surgical group, 1568 individuals experienced incident cardiovascular events compared with 7215 individuals in the nonsurgical group (incidence rate difference, 4.8 [95% CI, 4.5-5.0] per 100 person-years). At the end of the study, bariatric surgery was associated with a 49% lower risk of CVD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.48-0.54) compared with nonsurgical care. The risk of primary composite CVD outcomes was reduced by 47% (aHR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.48-0.59), and the risk of secondary composite CVD outcomes decreased by 50% (aHR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.46-0.53) in individuals with vs without surgery. Conclusions and relevance: Results of this study suggest that, compared with nonsurgical care, bariatric surgery was associated with significant reduction in CVD risk in individuals with severe obesity and NAFLD."

Owing to rising obesity rates, the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea is increasing, and it is a condition that is significantly underdiagnosed. Exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the backlog of elective surgeries is also sizable and growing. A combination of these factors means that many patients due to have surgery will have obstructive sleep apnoea, either diagnosed or otherwise. Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea have a significantly increased risk of operative complications, but the evidence base for optimum perioperative management of these patients is limited. This article reviews sleep apnoea, its prevalence and its impact on operative management and perioperative outcomes for patients. The evidence base for screening and treating undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnoea is also comprehensively assessed. Finally, a pathway to manage patients with possible undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnoea is proposed, and areas for further research identified."

However, the risk of infection complications in obese people is higher than that in normal people, especially the surgical site infection. This research investigates the effect of antibiotics on weight change of obese patients after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). A retrospective analysis was performed on 131 morbidly obese patients or obese patients with complications who received LSG treatment in the Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University from 2013 to 2020. Patients were separated into the antibiotic group (59 cases) and the normal group (72 cases) according to whether antibiotics were used after surgery. The differences of postoperative weight-related indexes, inflammation-related indexes, and short-term complications were compared between the two groups. At 12-month follow-up, the % excess weight loss (%EWL) in the antibiotic group was statistically abated than that in the normal group (92.99 ± 28.60, P 0.01). In addition, the percentage of total weight loss (%total weight loss (%TWL)) was abated in the antibiotic group than in the normal group, but it was not significant ( P &gt; 0.05).

International guidelines recommend patients are assessed upon admission and appropriate thromboprophylaxis should be initiated. However, studies have shown that thromboprophylaxis for patients at risk of venous thromboembolism is underutilized. Methods: this was a retrospective study conducted on hospitalized medical and surgical patients at Aga Khan Hospital Dar es salaam from January to June 2019. Patient's medical records were reviewed and data was collected for analysis of venous thromboembolism assessment and compliance with Caprini risk assessment model. The data was entered into statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) 25 and categorized into risk groups, frequency of patients' demographic and clinical characteristics data was calculated and the main study outcomes were analyzed with Fisher´s exact test or Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables and student t-test for continuous variables. Regression analyses were done to identify significant risk factors where by P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: compliance of venous thromboembolism assessment among medical and surgical patients was similar at 78% and 80%, respectively, with a baseline 22% of all admitted patients considered at risk of venous thromboembolism, hence needing thromboprophylaxis following the Caprini risk assessment modelscore. Thromboprophylaxis practices was identified at just 25% of at-risk individuals received pharmacological prophylaxis with enoxaparin; the most commonly used agent (92%). Identified risk factors for venous thromboembolism were advancing age (&gt;60 years), history of prior major surgery, Major surgery lasting &gt; 60 minutes, obesity, and immobilization. Conclusion: risk assessment for venous thromboembolism should be emphasized upon admission of both surgical and medical patients. Adequate thromboprophylaxis should be prescribed upon identification of patients at risk."
50,2019,36184273,Is bariatric surgery effective for obesity?,surgery obesity,1.0,"Purpose: Our goals were to identify individuals who required surgery for thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) joint osteoarthritis (OA), determine if CMC joint OA clusters in families, define the magnitude of familial risk of CMC joint OA, identify risk factors associated with CMC joint OA, and identify rare genetic variants that segregate with familial CMC joint OA. Methods: We searched the Utah Population Database to identify a cohort of CMC joint OA patients who required surgery. Affected individuals were mapped to pedigrees to identify high-risk families with excess clustering of CMC joint OA. Cox regression models were used to calculate familial risk of CMC joint OA in related individuals. Risk factors were evaluated using logistic regression models. Whole exome sequencing was used to identify rare coding variants associated with familial CMC joint OA. Results: We identified 550 pedigrees with excess clustering of severe CMC joint OA. The relative risk of CMC joint OA requiring surgical treatment was elevated significantly in first- and third-degree relatives of affected individuals, and significant associations with advanced age, female sex, obesity, and tobacco use were observed. We discovered candidate genes that dominantly segregate with severe CMC joint OA in 4 independent families, including a rare variant in Chondroitin Sulfate Synthase 3 (CHSY3). Conclusions: Familial clustering of severe CMC joint OA was observed in a statewide population. Our data indicate that genetic and environmental factors contribute to the disease process, further highlighting the multifactorial nature of the disease. Genomic analyses suggest distinct biological processes are involved in CMC joint OA pathogenesis. Clinical relevance: Awareness of associated comorbidities may guide the diagnosis of CMC joint OA in at-risk populations and help identify individuals who may not do well with nonoperative treatment. Further pursuit of the genes associated with severe CMC joint OA may lead to assays for detection of early stages of disease and have therapeutic potential."
51,2019,31791294,Can dehumidifiers be used to control asthma?,dehumidifiers asthma,0.0,"Background: Quantifying the effects of personal health behaviors and environmental exposure on asthma flare-ups is a challenge. Most studies have focused on monitoring the symptoms and drug usage for relieving symptoms. In this study, we emphasize the need to understand how personal and environmental conditions are related to the occurrence of asthma symptoms. Methods: We designed an online health diary platform to collect personal health behaviors from children, their parents and other adults with any allergic diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and allergic conjunctivitis. The participants used mobile devices or computers to record their daily health-related activities such as sleep, exercise, diet, perception of air quality and temperature, and asthma symptoms. The participants also recorded secondhand smoke exposure and the time of activities, which were combined with ambient air quality measurements for calculating personal air pollution exposure. A generalized linear mixed model was used to estimate the effects of the factors. Results: During the study period (January 2017-June 2017, and October 2017-September 2018), 132 participants provided 25,016 diary entries, and 84 participants had experienced asthma symptoms in 1458 diary entries. The results showed some different risk factors for the minors and adults. For minors, high-intensity exercise, contact with persons with influenza-like illness (ILI) and the perception of hot temperature and bad indoor air quality were associated with the occurrence of asthma episodes. The identified risk factors for the adult participants included having dehumidifiers at home, exposure to secondhand smoke, having bad sleep quality, contact with persons with ILI, not eating fruit and seafood, perceiving cold temperature, bad quality of indoor and outdoor air, and exposure to high concentration of ozone. Conclusions: The revealed personal risk factors and perceptions of air quality and temperature may provide guidance on behavioral change for people susceptible to asthma to help control acute onset and severe exacerbation of asthma flare-ups."
51,2019,23760885,Can dehumidifiers be used to control asthma?,dehumidifiers asthma,0.0,"Background: Humidity control measures in the home environment of patients with asthma have been recommended, since a warm humid environment favours the growth of house dust mites. However, there is no consensus about the usefulness of these measures. Objectives: To study the effect of dehumidification of the home environment on asthma control. Search methods: The clinical trials registers of the Cochrane Collaboration and Cochrane Airways Group were searched. Searches were current as of March 2013. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials on the use of humidity control measures in the home environment of patients with asthma were evaluated for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted independently using a pre-designed data extraction form by two review authors. Main results: A second trial has been added for the 2013 update of this review. The original open-label trial compared an intervention consisting of mechanical ventilation heat recovery system with or without high efficiency vacuum cleaner fitted in 40 homes of patients with asthma who had positive tests for sensitivity to house dust mite. The new double-blind trial also compared a mechanical ventilation heat recovery system with a placebo machine in the homes of 120 adults with allergy to house dust mite. The new trial, which was at low risk of bias, showed no significant difference in morning peak flow (mean difference (MD) 13.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.66 to 29.84), which was the primary outcome of the trial. However, there was a statistically significant improvement in evening peak flow only (MD 24.56; 95% CI 8.97 to 40.15). There was no significant difference in quality of life, rescue medication, requirement for oral corticosteroids, visits to the GP, emergency department (ED) or hospitalisations for asthma. There was no significant difference in the house dust mite count and the antigen levels in the new trial, in contrast to the previous trial. Authors' conclusions: Evidence on clinical benefits of dehumidification using mechanical ventilation with dehumidifiers remains scanty, and the addition of a new double blind trial to this review does not indicate significant benefit in most measure of control of asthma from such environmental interventions."

Methods: A total of 1,412 households with at least one member with current asthma and 2,290 control households answered questions about their home environment (e.g., presence of asthma triggers and practices that promote or reduce common asthma triggers). RESULTS; For children younger than 18 years of age, we found statistically significant positive associations between current asthma and the presence of mold (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3, 3.3), air cleaners (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1, 2.1), dehumidifiers (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.4, 2.7), and humidifiers (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1, 2.3). For adults, there were statistically significant positive associations with the presence of mold (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.8, 3.4), air cleaners (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.7, 2.8), and humidifiers (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.1, 1.8). There were no statistically significant associations with the presence of cockroaches, pets, or tobacco smoke, while use of a wood-burning stove or fireplace was significantly more prevalent in control homes. Conclusions: Asthma guidelines emphasize the importance of reducing triggers in the home as part of a multifaceted approach to asthma control. Despite these guidelines, many asthma triggers (specifically, mold) were as prevalent or more so in the homes of New Yorkers with asthma as compared with control households. Public health interventions in NYS should focus on educating households about potential asthma triggers and their sources and teach methods to prevent, reduce, or eliminate them."

There have been many trials of interventions aimed at reducing mite populations in the home, but most have been uncontrolled, too small, or too short to determine with confidence any beneficial effects. Of those which succeeded, very few used methods which reduced mite populations on a permanent basis. House dust mites are sensitive to humidity. Their geographical distribution is closely correlated to the availability of moisture. Very little work has been done on the effects of reducing humidity in the home environment in the long term, with a view to controlling dust mite populations. Two different methods which might reduce humidities to levels which could successfully reduce dust mite numbers are dehumidifiers, and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR). To date there has been no work assessing the effectiveness of dehumidifiers and very little (although promising) work on MVHR. We discuss the potential of humidity control as an adjunct to the clinical treatment of asthma."

103,2021,35406106,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,folic acid dementia,0.0,"Vitamin B 12 deficiency is associated with cognitive impairment, hyperhomocysteinemia, and hippocampal atrophy. However, the recovery of cognition with vitamin B 12 supplementation remains controversial. Of the 1716 patients who visited our outpatient clinic for dementia, 83 had vitamin B 12 deficiency. Among these, 39 patients (mean age, 80.1 ± 8.2 years) had undergone Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and laboratory tests for vitamin B 12 , homocysteine (Hcy), and folic acid levels. The hippocampal volume was estimated using the z-score of the MRI-voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease. This is multi-center, open-label, single-arm study. All the 39 patients were administered vitamin B 12 and underwent reassessment to measure the retested for MMSE and Hcy after 21-133 days (median = 56 days, interquartile range (IQR) = 43-79 days). After vitamin B 12 supplementation, the mean MMSE score improved significantly from 20.5 ± 6.4 to 22.9 ± 5.5 ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Hcy level decreased significantly from 22.9 ± 16.9 nmol/mL to 11.5 ± 3.9 nmol/mL ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Significant correlation was detected between the extent of change in MMSE scores and baseline Hcy values. The degree of MMSE score was not correlated with hippocampal atrophy assessed by the z-score. While several other factors should be considered, vitamin B 12 supplementation resulted in improved cognitive function, at least in the short term, in patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency."

The triglycerides and glucose (TyG) index, is a reliable and inexpensive surrogate test for detecting insulin resistance. Aims: The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between the TyG index and the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in older adults. Methods: A total of 135 individuals, men and women aged 60 to 90 years, were enrolled in a case and control study. Individuals with a diagnosis of MCI (n = 65) were allocated into the case group and compared with individuals without MCI (n = 70) in the control group. Alcohol intake, diabetes duration ≥5 years, diagnoses of cerebrovascular disease, brain injury, folic acid deficiency, dementia, moderate or severe CI, major depressive disorders, and thyroid disease were exclusion criteria. Results: Individuals in the case group exhibited higher waist circumference (97.9 ± 13.9 versus 93.5 ± 13.0, p = .001) and TyG index (5.0 ± 0.3 versus 4.1 ± 0.2, p = .001) than individuals in the control group. The TyG index ≥4.68 (OR 6.91; 95% CI 2.05-11.68) and waist circumference (OR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.06) were positively associated with MCI, while education level (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.30-0.61), occupation (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.59-0.61), and exercise (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.22-0.52) were inversely associated with MCI. After controlling for sex, age, waist circumference, education level, occupation, and exercise, a TyG index ≥4.68 remained significantly associated with MCI (OR 2.97; 95% CI 1.12-14.71). Conclusion: The TyG index is independently associated with the presence of MCI in older people."
103,2021,35268010,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,folic acid dementia,0.0,"Background: Dementia is a syndrome characterized by progressive cognitive impairment that interferes with independent function in daily activities. Symptoms of dementia depend on its cause and vary greatly between individuals. There is extensive evidence supporting a relationship between diet and cognitive functions. This systematic review studies the efficacy of using vitamin supplements in the diet as a solution to nutritional deficiencies and the prevention of dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Methods: An intensive search of different databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL) was performed. Articles that were published between 2011 and November 2021 were retrieved using the mentioned search strategy. This systematic review has been conducted according to the PRISMA statement. Results: Folic acid supplementation proved to have better outcomes on cognitive tests than their respective control groups. The combined supplementation of folic acid and vitamin B12 showed some discrepancies between studies. Thiamine as supplementation did not only prove to have a positive impact on cognitive performance when given alone but also when given in combination with folic acid. Regarding vitamin D supplementation, the results observed were not so encouraging. A concomitant supplementation of low-dose vitamin E and vitamin C was also not associated with an improvement of cognitive function. Conclusions: The findings of this systematic review suggest that supplementation of B Complex vitamins, especially folic acid, may have a positive effect on delaying and preventing the risk of cognitive decline. Ascorbic acid and a high dose of vitamin E, when given separately, also showed positive effects on cognitive performance, but there is not sufficient evidence to support their use. The results of vitamin D supplementation trials are not conclusive in assessing the potential benefits that vitamin D might have on cognition."

The aim of this study was to determine the nutritional status and eating habits of patients at the time of confirmed diagnosis of primary progressive dementia. Subjects and methods: The study included 40 outpatients (63% women) diagnosed with either form of dementia. The mean age at diagnosis was 77±6 years and the mean time between the onset of first symptoms of the disease and diagnosis was 3-36 months. Nutritional assessment was determined at the time of confirmed diagnoses and included dietary habits (non-quantitative modified food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)), anthropometric (body weight and height and body mass index-BMI) and biochemical parameters (serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid and 25-hydroxy vitamin D). Dietary habits were collected over a 12-month period with the help of a spouse or close family member. Results: The results showed that none of the outpatients were malnourished, the largest number of outpatients (43%) were in the normal body mass category followed by 33% in the overweight category. The results of this study confirmed previous findings of higher preference for sweet foods observed in 53% of patients with dementia. Low status of vitamin B12 was observed in 57% of outpatients, folic acid in 24% and 25 (OH) D in 75% of outpatients. Lower frequency of consumption of dark green leafy vegetables and lower consumption of poultry meat, fish and eggs could have an impact on nutrient deficiency. Conclusions: The poor nutritional status of outpatients with primary progressive dementia is associated with unhealthy dietary habits that may lead to micronutrient deficiencies. Dietary monitoring and intervention should be initiated immediately after the diagnosis of primary progressive dementia with the goal of reducing nutritional deficiencies and preventing further and more severe impairment of cognitive function."

103,2021,34866142,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,folic acid dementia,0.0,"Background and objectives: A randomized placebo-controlled trial found a significant negative interaction between aspirin and B vitamins in cognitive functioning in older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To validate this finding, we pooled data of this trial with that of a similar B-vitamin trial (VITACOG) to examine the effectiveness of B vitamins and their interactions with aspirin in improving global cognitive functioning and slowing brain atrophy in older people with MCI. Design: Pooled post-hoc analyses of two randomized placebo-controlled trials. Participants: In total, 545 older people with MCI were included in the study. Intervention: Placebo or B-vitamin supplements (vitamin B12, folic acid with or without vitamin B6) for 24 months. Measurements: The primary outcome was the Clinical Dementia Rating scale-global score (CDR-global). The secondary outcomes were CDR-sum of box score (CDR-SOB), memory Z-score, executive function Z-score, and whole brain atrophy rate. Results: 71 (26.2%) and 83 (30.3%) subjects in the active and placebo group respectively were aspirin users. Overall, B vitamins reduced whole brain atrophy rate significantly (P = 0.003), but did not have significant effect on CDR-global, CDR-SOB, memory and executive function. Aspirin use had significant negative interaction effects on B vitamins in CDR-global and CDR-SOB (Beta = 0.993, P = 0.038, and Beta = 0.583, P = 0.009, respectively), but not in memory or executive function Z-scores. Among aspirin non-users, B-vitamin group subjects had more favourable changes in CDR-global and CDR-SOB (P = 0.019 and 0.057, respectively). B vitamins significantly slowed brain atrophy in aspirin non-users (P = 0.001), but not in aspirin users, though the interaction term was not significant (Beta = 0.192, P = 0.276). Conclusion: In older people with MCI, B vitamins had significantly favourable effects on global cognitive functioning and whole brain atrophy rate in those who were not taking aspirin, but not in aspirin users."
103,2021,34788822,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,folic acid dementia,0.0,"Background: Higher serum homocysteine is associated with cognitive decline in older people. But homocysteine-lowering trials including folic acid (FA) show inconsistent results on cognitive decline. The reduction of FA to dihydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is slow in humans. Objective: We examined the effects of the DHFR 19-bp deletion/insertion (del/ins) polymorphism on FA-containing treatment on cognitive decline and brain atrophy in older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: This study used pooled data from two randomized B-vitamin trials on 545 MCI subjects who received either FA-containing B vitamins or placebo for 24 months. Subjects were typed for the DHFR genotype. Primary outcome was the Clinical Dementia Rating scale-global score (CDR-global). Secondary outcomes were CDR-sum of boxes score (CDR-SOB), memory and executive Z-scores and whole brain atrophy rate by serial MRI. Results: The proportions of subjects with del/del, del/ins and ins/ins genotype were 29.5, 44.3 and 26.1%, respectively. DHFR genotypes modified the effects of B vitamins on CDR-global, CDR-SOB and executive function Z-score (Pinteraction = 0.017, 0.014 and 0.052, respectively), with significant benefits being observed only in those with ins/ins genotype (Beta = -1.367, -0.614 and 0.315, P = 0.004, 0.014 and 0.012, respectively). The interaction was not significant for memory Z-score and whole brain atrophy rate. Notably, the supplements only slowed brain atrophy in members of the 'ins/ins' group who were not using aspirin. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the beneficial effects of B vitamins including FA on cognitive function are only apparent in those with ins/ins genotype, i.e. relatively better preserved DHFR activity."
103,2021,34593090,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,folic acid dementia,0.0,"Objective: To identify the dietary supplements most commonly promoted online for brain health and to compare their major ingredients over 18 months. Mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease are increasing globally with few effective treatments available. Dietary supplements are widely promoted in the media and online for brain health and memory improvement despite minimal evidence of an actual effect. Methods: Incognito mode on Google Chrome was used to conduct four separate searches using the terms: memory supplement, brain health supplement, Alzheimer's supplement, and dementia supplement. The four separate searches for products were conducted through CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, GNC, Amazon, Yahoo, and Google. For each website, the top 10 supplement products and their ingredients were documented in August 2017 and again in January 2019. Results: Of the four terms used, ""memory supplement"" and ""brain health supplement"" provided the most results. The most common products were Prevagen®, Procera®, and Neuro Health®. Amazon had the most repeated products in 2017 and 2019, while Google and CVS had the least. Focus Factor® appeared 11 times in 2019 compared with once in 2017. At both time points, the most commonly promoted products were proprietary blends of Ginkgo biloba, vitamins, particularly vitamin B12 and folic acid, huperzine-A, Bacopa monnieri, and phosphatidylserine. Conclusions: Though the 2017 and 2019 datasets showed diverse products, the primary ingredients were similar. These supplements have insufficient evidence of efficacy and are expensive. Health professionals must be knowledgeable about dietary supplements for brain health to appropriately counsel individuals."
103,2021,34578844,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,folic acid dementia,0.0,"Cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease, among other cognitive dysfunctions, has been recognized as a major public health problem. Folic acid is a well-known essential nutrient whose deficiency has been linked to neurocognitive dysfunctions, owing to hyperhomocysteinemia, an independent risk factor for cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases, including cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's Disease, and vascular dementia. However, to date, there is certain controversy about the efficacy of vitamin supplementation in patients with these pathologies. Therefore, we have reviewed the available dietary intervention studies based on folic acid, either alone or in combination with different vitamins or nutrients into the progression of Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive impairment, highlighting the cognition and biochemical markers employed for the evaluation of the disease progression. Undeniably, the compiled information supports the potential benefits of vitamin supplementation in these pathologies, especially relevant to the aging process and quality of life, although more research is urgently needed to confirm these positive findings."
103,2021,34552900,Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,folic acid dementia,0.0,"Background: Reversible etiologies of cognitive impairment are common and treatable, yet the majority of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia research in Latin America has focused on irreversible, neurodegenerative etiologies. Objective: We sought to determine if thyroid dysfunction and vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies are associated with cognitive disorders among older adults with memory complaints in Lima, Peru. Methods: This was a retrospective review of patients who presented for cognitive evaluations to a multidisciplinary neurology clinic in Lima, Peru from January 2014 to February 2020. We included individuals aged ≥60 years, native Spanish-speakers, with at least a primary school educational level and a complete clinical assessment. Patients had either subjective cognitive decline (SCD), MCI, or dementia. One-way ANOVA and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: We included 720 patients (330 SCD, 154 MCI, and 236 dementia); the dementia group was significantly older [mean age SCD 69.7 ± 4.1, dementia 72.4 ± 3.7 ( p = 0.000)] and had lower folate levels than SCD patients. The MCI group had higher free T3 levels compared with SCD patients. Those with lower TSH had greater dementia risk (OR = 2.91, 95%CI: 1.15-6.86) but not MCI risk in unadjusted models. B12 deficiency or borderline B12 deficiency was present in 34% of the dementia group, yet no clear correlation was seen between neuropsychological test results and B12 levels in our study. There was no association between MCI or dementia and thyroid hormone, B12 nor folate levels in adjusted models. Conclusion: Our findings do not support an association between metabolic and endocrine disorders and cognitive impairment in older Peruvians from Lima despite a high prevalence of B12 deficiency. Future work may determine if cognitive decline is associated with metabolic or endocrine changes in Latin America."

The objective of the current study is to assess the therapeutic effect of duct tape occlusion in comparison to cryotherapy in treatment of plantar warts in adults, in a prospective comparative randomized non-inferiority design. A total of 100 patients presenting with plantar warts were divided into two equal groups. First group was treated with silver duct tape occlusion for up to 8 weeks or disappearance of warts, whichever occurred first. Second group was treated with cryotherapy every 2 to 3 weeks for a maximum of four sessions or disappearance of warts. There was a statistically significant lower rate of complete resolution in duct tape than cryotherapy group (20% vs 58%, P = .0001, respectively). Degree of response to treatment in the duct tape and cryotherapy groups was not correlated to patients' age (P = .361 and .334, respectively) or disease duration (P = .266 and .285, respectively), while there was a statistically significant inverse relationship between the number (P = .0032 and .001, respectively) and diameter of warts (P = .013 and .003, respectively) and the degree of response in the two studied groups. Cryotherapy has higher efficacy than duct tape in the treatment of plantar warts in adults; however, duct tape may represent a practical and convenient alternative to cryotherapy in certain circumstances."
104,2021,31088871,Does duct tape work for wart removal?,duct tape warts,0.0,"Question I continue to see families in my practice with complaints of having common warts. Despite trying to convince them that no therapy is needed, children and parents ask for advice and therapy. Is duct tape truly effective for common warts, and how is it applied? Answer Common warts (verruca vulgaris) are extremely common in children and are caused by the human papillomavirus. These benign lesions will resolve spontaneously and no therapy is recommended. Evidence for duct tape effectiveness is limited, but because this therapy is safe and well tolerated, parents can try it at home, as well as try using salicylic acid patches. With duct tape therapy, apply a small piece of duct tape directly on the wart once every 4 to 7 days; then remove the tape, clean the area with soap and water, and remove the dead skin using an emery board. Apply another piece of tape 12 hours later. Repeat this cycle for 4 to 6 weeks."

104,2021,22972052,Does duct tape work for wart removal?,duct tape warts,0.0,"Background: Viral warts are a common skin condition, which can range in severity from a minor nuisance that resolve spontaneously to a troublesome, chronic condition. Many different topical treatments are available. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of local treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts in healthy, immunocompetent adults and children. Search methods: We updated our searches of the following databases to May 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2010), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), and CINAHL (from 1981). We searched reference lists of articles and online trials registries for ongoing trials. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of topical treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected trials and extracted data; a third author resolved any disagreements. Main results: We included 85 trials involving a total of 8815 randomised participants (26 new studies were included in this update). There was a wide range of different treatments and a variety of trial designs. Many of the studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in one or more areas of trial design.Trials of salicylic acid (SA) versus placebo showed that the former significantly increased the chance of clearance of warts at all sites (RR (risk ratio) 1.56, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.20 to 2.03). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 5.01) and feet (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.55), suggested it might be more effective for hands than feet.A meta-analysis of cryotherapy versus placebo for warts at all sites favoured neither intervention nor control (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.23). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 15.94) and feet (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.07), again suggested better outcomes for hands than feet. One trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both placebo and SA, but only for hand warts.There was no significant difference in cure rates between cryotherapy at 2-, 3-, and 4-weekly intervals.Aggressive cryotherapy appeared more effective than gentle cryotherapy (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.15), but with increased adverse effects.Meta-analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in effectiveness between cryotherapy and SA at all sites (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.71) or in subgroup analyses for hands and feet.Two trials with 328 participants showed that SA and cryotherapy combined appeared more effective than SA alone (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.43).The benefit of intralesional bleomycin remains uncertain as the evidence was inconsistent. The most informative trial with 31 participants showed no significant difference in cure rate between bleomycin and saline injections (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.78).Dinitrochlorobenzene was more than twice as effective as placebo in 2 trials with 80 participants (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.26).Two trials of clear duct tape with 193 participants demonstrated no advantage over placebo (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.05).We could not combine data from trials of the following treatments: intralesional 5-fluorouracil, topical zinc, silver nitrate (which demonstrated possible beneficial effects), topical 5-fluorouracil, pulsed dye laser, photodynamic therapy, 80% phenol, 5% imiquimod cream, intralesional antigen, and topical alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid (which showed no advantage over placebo).We did not identify any RCTs that evaluated surgery (curettage, excision), formaldehyde, podophyllotoxin, cantharidin, diphencyprone, or squaric acid dibutylester. Authors' conclusions: Data from two new trials comparing SA and cryotherapy have allowed a better appraisal of their effectiveness. The evidence remains more consistent for SA, but only shows a modest therapeutic effect. Overall, trials comparing cryotherapy with placebo showed no significant difference in effectiveness, but the same was also true for trials comparing cryotherapy with SA. Only one trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both SA and placebo, and this was only for hand warts. Adverse effects, such as pain, blistering, and scarring, were not consistently reported but are probably more common with cryotherapy.None of the other reviewed treatments appeared safer or more effective than SA and cryotherapy. Two trials of clear duct tape demonstrated no advantage over placebo. Dinitrochlorobenzene (and possibly other similar contact sensitisers) may be useful for the treatment of refractory warts."

Design: Double-blind controlled clinical intervention trial. Setting: Veterans Affairs medical center. Participants: A total of 90 immunocompetent adult volunteers with at least 1 wart measuring 2 to 15 mm were enrolled between October 1, 2004, and July 31, 2005. Eighty patients completed the study. Intervention: Patients were randomized by a computer-generated code to receive pads consisting of either moleskin with transparent duct tape (treatment group) or moleskin alone (control group). Patients were instructed to wear the pads for 7 consecutive days and leave the pad off on the seventh evening. This process was repeated for 2 months or until the wart resolved, whichever occurred first. Follow-up visits occurred at 1 and 2 months. Main outcome measure: Complete resolution of the target wart. Secondary outcomes included change in size of the target wart and recurrence rates at 6 months for warts with complete resolution. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the proportions of patients with resolution of the target wart (8 [21%] of 39 patients in the treatment group vs 9 [22%] of 41 in the control group). Of patients with complete resolution, 6 (75%) in the treatment group and 3 (33%) in the control group had recurrence of the target wart by the sixth month.

104,2021,17326748,Does duct tape work for wart removal?,duct tape warts,0.0,"Background: Several general practitioner (GP)-prescribed and over-the-counter therapies for warts and verrucae are available. However, the cost-effectiveness of these treatments is unknown. Objectives: To compare the cost-effectiveness of different treatments for cutaneous warts. Methods: We designed a decision-analytic Markov simulation model based on systematic review evidence to estimate the cost-effectiveness of various treatments. The outcome measures studied are percentage of patients cured, cost of treatment and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each treatment, compared with no treatment, after 18 weeks. Results: Duct tape was most cost-effective but published evidence of its effectiveness is sparse. Salicylic acid was the most cost-effective over-the-counter treatment commonly used. Cryotherapy administered by a GP was less cost-effective than GP-prescribed salicylic acid and less cost-effective than cryotherapy administered by a nurse. Conclusions: Duct tape could be adopted as the primary treatment for cutaneous warts if its effectiveness is verified by further rigorous trials. Nurse-administered cryotherapy is likely to be more cost-effective than GP-administered cryotherapy."

One hundred patients with vitiligo were treated with oral folic acid and vitamin B12 after being informed that sun exposure might enhance repigmentation. They were requested to keep a record of sun exposure in summer and UVB irradiation in winter. The minimal treatment time suggested was 3-6 months but should be longer if improvement was achieved. Clear repigmentation occurred in 52 patients, including 37 who exposed their skin to summer sun and 6 who used UVB lamps in winter. Repigmentation was most evident on sun-exposed areas, where 38% of the patients had previously noted repigmentation during summer months. Total repigmentation was seen in 6 patients. The spread of vitiligo stopped in 64% of the patients after treatment. Folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation combined with sun exposure can induce repigmentation better than either the vitamins or sun exposure alone. Treatment should continue as long as the white areas continue to repigment. Further studies are needed to determine ideal minimal dosages of vitamins and UV exposure, as well as treatment time."

There is no cure for asthma, and the management is usually as per published guidelines. As in many chronic diseases conditions, various alternative or complimentary therapies have been tried. Of these, yoga and pranayama have gained wider attention in recent years. While the term yoga is a complex term encompassing eight limbs as per Patamjai in the yoga sutras, in simple terms, yoga is described as a combination of 'asana' (physical exercises) and 'pranayama' (breathing exercise). The term ""asthma"" has been derived from the Greek word ""panting,"", which indicates a rapid and shallow breathing. The main aim of yoga and pranayama in asthma is to synchronize and control breathing, thus decreasing hyperventilation. Besides this, they also decrease the stress/strain/anxiety, change in behavior, boost immunity, and improve strength/endurance of respiratory muscles that are helpful in any subject with asthma. There have been a good number of studies including clinical trials in children with asthma that have found some beneficial effects. In the present review, the physiology of yoga and pranayama, rationale for their use in children with asthma along with a summary of various studies conducted till date, have been discussed. These are followed by recommendations regarding their incorporation in the standard of care of children with asthma."

Publications on yoga between 1948 and 1970 (1.25%) focused on exceptional abilities of experienced yoga practitioners, apparently related to the spiritual goal of yoga; from 1971 to 2000 (6.87%), the focus was on yoga in health and therapy; and from 2001 to 2020 (91.88%), research publications on yoga increased and continued to focus on health and therapy, with fewer RCTs relative to the SRs and MAs on yoga in PubMed. Publications on yoga reported the following health conditions most often: from 1981 to 1990, (1) asthma, (2) stress, and (3) diabetes; from 1991 to 2000, (1) stress followed by (2) asthma, anxiety, and pain (all three with equal percentages); from 2001 to 2010, (1) depression, (2) stress, and (3) anxiety; and from 2011 to 2020, (1) stress, (2) depression, and (3) pain. The journals publishing research on yoga in PubMed have changed between 1971 and 2020 as follows: highly clinically relevant, broad-interest medical journals (1971 to 1990); journals relevant to mind-body interventions (1991 to 2000); and specialized journals for complementary and alternative medicine, particular branches of medicine, or research study designs (2001 to 2020). The highest yoga research output from 1971 to 1980 came from the United Kingdom (RCTs); from 1981 to 1990 the most research came from the United States (RCTs); from 1991 to 2000 the most research came from India (RCTs) and the United Kingdom (SRs); from 2001 to 2010 the most research came from the United States (RCTs, SRs) and the United Kingdom (MAs); and from 2011 to 2020 the most research came from the United States (RCTs, SRs, MAs). The trends in yoga research from this analysis reflect increased research related to yoga and health while suggesting areas for future research based on the strengths and gaps that have emerged."
107,2021,33639922,Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,yoga asthma,1.0,"Background: Physical inactivity is common in severe asthma and associated with poor health outcomes. New approaches are needed to address physical inactivity in this group. Objective: To examine whether yoga and mindfulness improves health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared with a minimal active control group and collect feasibility data to inform future studies. Methods: Over 12-weeks, adults with severe asthma were recruited. Participants were randomised 2:1 to parallel yoga or control groups. All participants received an activity tracker. The yoga group received tailored group classes twice a week for 16-weeks with a qualified yoga instructor. The control group set activity goals with a research officer and received eight progress calls. Outcomes were assessed at 16-weeks. Primary outcome was St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Secondary outcomes included asthma control, physical activity, breathlessness, and inflammation. Face-to-face qualitative interviews were conducted to determine acceptability. Results: There were 15 participants randomised to yoga (mean 67 years; 60% female) and 9 to control (68 years; 56% female). Planned comparisons indicated the yoga group had greater SGRQ improvement than the control group. There was little change in secondary outcomes. Moderate-vigorous activity increased substantially in the control group. Participants found the intervention acceptable; key barriers and facilitators were social connection, the setting, addressing breathing and asthma symptoms, changing their mindset, and the intersection of different elements. Conclusion: A yoga and mindfulness intervention was feasible, acceptable to patients and improved HRQoL. The findings will inform design of much needed future research into physical activity interventions for severe asthma.

107,2021,33625666,Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,yoga asthma,1.0,"Objective: To assess the effect of yoga on control of asthma in children with bronchial asthma. Methods: This hospital-based interventional randomized controlled trial conducted in the Department of Pediatrics at a tertiary care center of North India from November 2017 to October 2018 enrolled 140 newly diagnosed cases of asthma of age 10-16 y who were randomly divided into two groups. Seventy children in the case group practiced yoga under supervision for a period of 3 mo in addition to pharmacological treatment. Seventy controls received only pharmacological treatment. Pulmonary-function tests were done at baseline, 6 wk, and 12 wk along with quality of life (QOL) assessment by Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ). The outcome measures assessed were forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). QOL evaluation was done in 3 domains: activity limitation, symptoms, and emotional function. Results: The asthmatic children practicing yoga have shown significant improvement in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and PEFR which was better as compared to controls. Improvement was also noted in mean-PAQLQ score in cases which was statistically significantly better as compared to controls. Conclusion: Yoga appears to have significant positive effect on control of asthma measured by pulmonary-function test and QOL. Therefore yoga therapy can be recommended as an adjuvant in management of asthma along with standard pharmacological management."

Material and method: The study was conducted between May and August 2020 as a randomized controlled study. 'Personal Information Form', 'Respiratory Functions Monitoring Form', 'COPD and Asthma Fatigue Scale (CAFS), ""Asthma and COPD Sleep Impact Scale (CASIS)"" and Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC) were used in data collection. Results: When the post-test mean scores of the patients in the experimental and control group were compared, it was found that CAFS, CASIS and mMRC mean scores of the patients in the experimental group decreased positively compared to the patients in the control group and the difference between was found to be statistically significant (p 0.05). Conclusion: Yoga has been found to reduce the severity of dyspnea and fatigue and improve sleep quality in chronic respiratory diseases."
107,2021,33030846,Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,yoga asthma,1.0,"We conducted a prospective observational study to evaluate the efficacy of yoga in poorly controlled severe asthmatic patients treated with maximal inhaled therapy and biologics. The objective of yoga was to improve breathing consciousness, exercising controlled ventilation with and without retention, abdominal breathing observation, improvement of inspiratory and expiratory muscles, opening of the chest, diaphragm exercises and relaxation. We measured exhaled nitric oxide, forced expiratory volume in one second, forced vital capacity, asthma control and quality of life questionnaires, anxiety and depression questionnaires before and after the tenth yoga course (performed twice a week). Half of the patients who were invited to participate to the study declined due to organization problems. Two patients were excluded due to bronchitis and arthralgia respectively. The analysis of the data from 12 participants revealed significant improvement in asthma control and asthma quality of life questionnaires and a reduction of anxiety.The regular practice of yoga in severe asthmatics insufficiently controlled despite maximal inhaled treatment and biotherapy seems to be an interesting complementary option to improve asthma control. Our results must be confirmed in larger randomized controlled trials."

This pilot study examined the tolerability, feasibility, acceptability and immediate effects of a mindful yoga intervention in children with severe asthma. Method: Fifteen children ages 7-11 with severe asthma participated in a single mindful yoga session, followed by semi-structured interviews with the child and caregiver. Vital signs and pulmonary function tests were collected pre- and post-intervention. Results: All children reported positive experiences and caregivers were generally supportive of their participation. One child experienced self-limited bronchoconstriction with asthma symptoms. There was no significant change in lung function or vital signs after the mindful yoga session. Discussion: Our results warrant additional larger studies to evaluate the safety and benefits of mindful yoga in children with severe asthma."
107,2021,32213455,Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,yoga asthma,1.0,"Problem: Asthma affects almost 15% of children in the United States. Despite the availability of treatments and educational methods, children with asthma continue to report an impaired quality of life, including symptoms of anxiety and inability to participate in physical activity. As complementary health approaches are becoming more popular and show promise in the management of many chronic diseases, the purpose of this integrative review is to examine the state of the science regarding popular complementary health approaches- yoga and mindfulness- for children and adolescents with asthma. Eligibility criteria: A comprehensive search of five databases for peer reviewed articles was performed to identify experimental and non-experimental studies. The search for each database was performed from the inception of each to January 2020 and limited to the English language. The search included terminology that addressed the concepts of ""asthma"", ""yoga"" and ""mindfulness"". Sample: A total of eleven articles met the criteria for review from the years 1991 to 2019. Results: Nine publications focused on the use of yoga in children and adolescents with asthma and two publications focused on mindfulness in adolescents with asthma. Conclusions: Interventions involving either mindfulness or yoga may be effective in reducing stress and anxiety and improving quality of life and lung function in this population. Implications: Mindfulness intervention studies in the pediatric and adolescent asthma population are warranted as are additional studies that include the use of yoga with skills in mindfulness in order to evaluate their physiological and psychological effects."
107,2021,32212422,Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,yoga asthma,1.0,"Background: Breathing exercises have been widely used worldwide as a non-pharmacological therapy to treat people with asthma. Breathing exercises aim to control the symptoms of asthma and can be performed as the Papworth Method, the Buteyko breathing technique, yogic breathing, deep diaphragmatic breathing or any other similar intervention that manipulates the breathing pattern. The training of breathing usually focuses on tidal and minute volume and encourages relaxation, exercise at home, the modification of breathing pattern, nasal breathing, holding of breath, lower rib cage and abdominal breathing. Objectives: To evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of breathing exercises in the management of people with asthma. Search methods: To identify relevant studies we searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and AMED and performed handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. We also consulted trials registers and reference lists of included articles. The most recent literature search was on 4 April 2019. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials of breathing exercises in adults with asthma compared with a control group receiving asthma education or, alternatively, with no active control group. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We used Review Manager 5 software for data analysis based on the random-effects model. We expressed continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) with confidence intervals (CIs) of 95%. We assessed heterogeneity by inspecting the forest plots. We applied the Chi<sup>2</sup> test, with a P value of 0.10 indicating statistical significance, and the I<sup>2</sup> statistic, with a value greater than 50% representing a substantial level of heterogeneity. The primary outcome was quality of life. Main results: We included nine new studies (1910 participants) in this update, resulting in a total of 22 studies involving 2880 participants in the review. Fourteen studies used Yoga as the intervention, four studies involved breathing retraining, one the Buteyko method, one the Buteyko method and pranayama, one the Papworth method and one deep diaphragmatic breathing. The studies were different from one another in terms of type of breathing exercise performed, number of participants enrolled, number of sessions completed, period of follow-up, outcomes reported and statistical presentation of data. Asthma severity in participants from the included studies ranged from mild to moderate, and the samples consisted solely of outpatients. Twenty studies compared breathing exercise with inactive control, and two with asthma education control groups. Meta-analysis was possible for the primary outcome quality of life and the secondary outcomes asthma symptoms, hyperventilation symptoms, and some lung function variables. Assessment of risk of bias was impaired by incomplete reporting of methodological aspects of most of the included studies. We did not include adverse effects as an outcome in the review. Breathing exercises versus inactive control For quality of life, measured by the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), meta-analysis showed improvement favouring the breathing exercises group at three months (MD 0.42, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.68; 4 studies, 974 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and at six months the OR was 1.34 for the proportion of people with at least 0.5 unit improvement in AQLQ, (95% CI 0.97 to 1.86; 1 study, 655 participants). For asthma symptoms, measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), meta-analysis at up to three months was inconclusive, MD of -0.15 units (95% CI -2.32 to 2.02; 1 study, 115 participants; low-certainty evidence), and was similar over six months (MD -0.08 units, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.07; 1 study, 449 participants). For hyperventilation symptoms, measured by the Nijmegen Questionnaire (from four to six months), meta-analysis showed less symptoms with breathing exercises (MD -3.22, 95% CI -6.31 to -0.13; 2 studies, 118 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but this was not shown at six months (MD 0.63, 95% CI -0.90 to 2.17; 2 studies, 521 participants). Meta-analyses for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) measured at up to three months was inconclusive, MD -0.10 L, (95% CI -0.32 to 0.12; 4 studies, 252 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, for FEV 1 % of predicted, an improvement was observed in favour of the breathing exercise group (MD 6.88%, 95% CI 5.03 to 8.73; five studies, 618 participants). Breathing exercises versus asthma education For quality of life, one study measuring AQLQ was inconclusive up to three months (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.34; 1 study, 183 participants). When assessed from four to six months, the results favoured breathing exercises (MD 0.38, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.68; 1 study, 183 participants). Hyperventilation symptoms measured by the Nijmegen Questionnaire were inconclusive up to three months (MD -1.24, 95% CI -3.23 to 0.75; 1 study, 183 participants), but favoured breathing exercises from four to six months (MD -3.16, 95% CI -5.35 to -0.97; 1 study, 183 participants). Authors' conclusions: Breathing exercises may have some positive effects on quality of life, hyperventilation symptoms, and lung function. Due to some methodological differences among included studies and studies with poor methodology, the quality of evidence for the measured outcomes ranged from moderate to very low certainty according to GRADE criteria. In addition, further studies including full descriptions of treatment methods and outcome measurements are required."
109,2021,36209164,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Background: Despite being a promising strategy, current chemotherapy for gastric cancer (GC) is limited due to adverse side effects and poor survival rates. Therefore, new drug-delivery platforms with good biocompatibility are needed. Recent studies have shown that nanoparticle-based drug delivery can be safe, eco-friendly, and nontoxic making them attractive candidates. Here, we develop a novel selenium-nanoparticle based drug-delivery agent for cancer treatment from plant extracts and selenium salts. Results: Selenium cations were reduced to selenium nanoparticles using Kaempferia parviflora (black ginger) root extract and named KP-SeNP. Transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray, dynamic light scattering, and Fourier-transform infrared spectrum were utilized to confirm the physicochemical features of the nanoparticles. The KP-SeNPs showed significant cytotoxicity in human gastric adenocarcinoma cell (AGS cells) but not in normal cells. We determined that the intracellular signaling pathway mechanisms associated with the anticancer effects of KP-SeNPs involve the upregulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling markers, such as B-cell lymphoma 2, Bcl-associated X protein, and caspase 3 in AGS cells. KP-SeNPs also caused autophagy of AGS by increasing the autophagic flux-marker protein, LC3B-II, whilst inhibiting autophagic cargo protein, p62. Additionally, phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway markers and downstream targets was decreased in KP-SeNP-treated AGS cells. AGS-cell xenograft model results further validated our in vitro findings, showing that KP-SeNPs are biologically safe and exert anticancer effects via autophagy and apoptosis. Conclusions: These results show that KP-SeNPs treatment of AGS cells induces apoptosis and autophagic cell death through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, suppressing GC progression. Thus, our research strongly suggests that KP-SeNPs could act as a novel potential therapeutic agent for GC."
109,2021,36108716,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Selenium is a trace element that has been shown to inhibit the growth of various cancer cell types. However, its role in cervical cancer and its underlying mechanisms remains largely unknown. Herein, we explored the anti-cervical cancer effect of selenium and its potential mechanisms through xenograft and in vitro experiments. HeLa cell xenografts in female nude mice showed tumor growth retardation, with no obvious liver and kidney toxicity, after being intraperitoneally injected with 3 mg/kg sodium selenite (SS) for 14 days. Compared to the control group, selenium levels in the tumor tissue increased significantly after SS treatment. In vitro experiments, SS inhibited the viability of HeLa and SiHa cells, blocked the cell cycle at the S phase, and enhanced apoptosis. RNA-sequencing, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis showed that forkhead box protein O (FOXO) was a key regulatory signaling pathway for SS to exhibit anticancer effects. Gene Ontology analysis filtered multiple terms associated with apoptosis, anti-proliferation, and cell cycle arrest. Further research revealed that SS increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impaired mitochondrial function, which activated adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) via phosphorylation at Thr172, resulting in activation of FOXO3a and its downstream growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible alpha (GADD45a). In summary, SS exhibited anti-cervical cancer effects, and their mechanisms may be that SS is involved in inducing cell cycle arrest and potentiating cell apoptosis caused by ROS-dependent activation of the AMPK/FOXO3a/GADD45a axis."
109,2021,36105397,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Introduction: Salivary gland dysfunction (e.g., sialadenitis and xerostomia) is the most common complication of radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Several methods have been used to reduce/prevent this adverse effect. We aimed to systematically review the effectiveness of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions in preventing RAI-induced salivary gland dysfunction in patients with DTC. Methods: A systematic review was conducted, according to PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was registered (PROSPERO: CRD42022295229). PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library electronic databases were searched from inception to November 2021. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of DTC patients who were older than 18 years and underwent RAI after thyroidectomy in which at least one studied group received an intervention to prevent salivary gland dysfunction. Results: Twelve studies (a total of 667 participants) were included. Among DTC patients who were treated with RAI, nonpharmacological treatment such as parotid gland massage and aromatherapy ameliorated salivary gland dysfunction. Antioxidants such as vitamin E and selenium demonstrated radioprotective effects on the salivary gland, while other antioxidants did not show radioprotective benefits. Vitamin C showed no significant effects on preventing salivary gland dysfunction. Amifostine had inconsistent outcomes among studies. Among cholinergic agonists, pilocarpine did not demonstrate the radioprotective effect on parotid glands, while bethanechol lowered salivary gland dysfunction. However, the negative results from pilocarpine may be explained by the strong sialorrheic effect of the Cincinnati regimen in both study arms. Conclusion: Among non-pharmacological and pharmacological methods, parotid gland massage, aromatherapy, vitamin E, selenium, amifostine, and bethanechol may have benefits in minimizing RAI-induced salivary gland dysfunction in patients with DTC. The results are limited by a small number of patients and should be confirmed in future larger randomized controlled trials.

109,2021,36099132,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Background/aim: Non-medical practitioners (NMPs) are an ill-defined group of professionals offering patient diagnostic and therapeutic methods mostly in the field of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Despite a lack of quality-assessed structured professional formation, many patients with cancer visit NMPs for advice. This study aimed to learn more on patients' motives and expectations for consulting an NMP. Patients and methods: A standardized questionnaire was distributed to adult cancer patients addressing attitudes towards NMPs, motives and expectations for consulting an NMP. Results: A total of 279 patients took part in the survey. Of the included patients 44.8% had already visited an NMP and 16.5% planned to do so. Reasons to visit an NMP were seeking for a supplementary treatment (72.0%) or control of side-effects (68.0%). While the oncologist ranked higher than the NMP in all aspects of physician-patient interaction and patients more often trusted in the oncologist, those patients rating their oncologist rather low in any of these questions significantly more often consulted an NMP. The methods applied or recommended by the NMPs were highly heterogenous ranging from biologically-based methods to mind-body-techniques. Most often used methods were homeopathy (72.0%) vitamin D (62.7%), selenium (42.7%), acupuncture (38.7%). Conclusion: There is a high proportion of cancer patients visiting NMPs mostly for additional treatment. Biologically-based treatments may induce side-effects and interactions, especially as NMPs are not trained on medically accepted cancer treatment and medications. Offering information on CAM and improving the physician-patient relationship are important means to answer unmet needs from the side of the patient."
109,2021,36084791,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Methionine (Met) can be oxidized to methionine sulfoxide (MetO), which exist as R- and S-diastereomers. Present in all three domains of life, methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSR) are the enzymes that reduce MetO back to Met. Most characterized among them are MSRA and MSRB, which are strictly stereospecific for the S- and R-diastereomers of MetO, respectively. While the majority of MSRs use a catalytic Cys to reduce their substrates, some employ selenocysteine. This is the case of mammalian MSRB1, which was initially discovered as selenoprotein SELR or SELX and later was found to exhibit an MSRB activity. Genomic analyses demonstrated its occurrence in most animal lineages, and biochemical and structural analyses uncovered its catalytic mechanism. The use of transgenic mice and mammalian cell culture revealed its physiological importance in the protection against oxidative stress, maintenance of neuronal cells, cognition, cancer cell proliferation, and the immune response. Coincident with the discovery of Met oxidizing MICAL enzymes, recent findings of MSRB1 regulating the innate immunity response through reversible stereospecific Met-R-oxidation of cytoskeletal actin opened up new avenues for biological importance of MSRB1 and its role in disease. In this review, we discuss the current state of research on MSRB1, compare it with other animal Msrs, and offer a perspective on further understanding of biological functions of this selenoprotein."
109,2021,36079882,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Selenium has been well recognized for its important role in human health. Prior studies showed that low serum selenium was associated with various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, infertility, and cognitive decline. Recent studies demonstrated an association between selenium deficiency and liver cirrhosis. In our study, we aimed to explore the association between serum selenium levels and severity of liver fibrosis. In total, 5641 participants at an age of 12 and above, from the 2017-2018 United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, were enrolled. The severity of liver fibrosis was determined by liver ultrasound transient elastography. There was a significant linear decrease in liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values in male groups with increased serum selenium levels. The beta coefficient (β) = -1.045 in male groups. A significantly negative association was also observed in the group of age ≥ 60. In addition, those in the highest quartile of serum selenium had lower LSM values (β = -0.416). This is the first study using LSM to demonstrate the correlation between selenium deficiency and severity of liver cirrhosis. Our findings suggest that a high plasma selenium concentration is negatively correlated with the severity of liver cirrhosis and there are gender and age differences."
109,2021,36067902,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"The habitual intake of selenium (Se) varies strongly around the world, and many people are at risk of inadequate supply and health risks from Se deficiency. Within the human organism, efficient transport mechanisms ensure that organs with a high demand and relevance for reproduction and survival are preferentially supplied. To this end, selenoprotein P (SELENOP) is synthesized in the liver and mediates Se transport to essential tissues such as the endocrine glands and the brain, where the ""SELENOP cycle"" maintains a privileged Se status. Mouse models indicate that SELENOP is not essential for life, as supplemental Se supply was capable of preventing the development of severe symptoms. However, knockout mice died under limiting supply, arguing for an essential role of SELENOP in Se deficiency. Many clinical studies support this notion, pointing to close links between health risks and low SELENOP levels. Accordingly, circulating SELENOP concentrations serve as a functional biomarker of Se supply, at least until a saturated status is achieved and SELENOP levels reach a plateau. Upon toxic intake, a further increase in SELENOP is observed, i.e., SELENOP provides information about possible selenosis. The SELENOP transcripts predict an insertion of ten selenocysteine residues. However, the decoding is imperfect, and not all these positions are ultimately occupied by selenocysteine. In addition to the selenocysteine residues near the C-terminus, one selenocysteine resides central within an enzyme-like environment. SELENOP proved capable of catalyzing peroxide degradation in vitro and protecting e.g. LDL particles from oxidation. An enzymatic activity in the intact organism is unclear, but an increasing number of clinical studies provides evidence for a direct involvement of SELENOP-dependent Se transport as an important and modifiable risk factor of disease. This interaction is particularly strong for cardiovascular and critical disease including COVID-19, cancer at various sites and autoimmune thyroiditis. This review briefly highlights the links between the growing knowledge of Se in health and disease over the last 50 years and the specific advances that have been made in our understanding of the physiological and clinical contribution of SELENOP to the current picture."
109,2021,36008942,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"The human genome has 25 genes coding for selenocysteine (Sec)-containing proteins, whose synthesis is supported by specialized Sec machinery proteins. Here, we carried out an analysis of the co-essentiality network to identify functional partners of selenoproteins and Sec machinery. One outstanding cluster included all seven known Sec machinery proteins and two critical selenoproteins, GPX4 and TXNRD1. Additionally, these nine genes were further positively associated with PRDX6 and negatively with SCD, linking the latter two genes to the essential role of selenium. We analyzed the essentiality scores of gene knockouts in this cluster across one thousand cancer cell lines and found that Sec metabolism genes are strongly selective for a subset of primary tissues, suggesting that certain cancer cell lineages are particularly dependent on selenium. A separate outstanding cluster included selenophosphate synthetase SEPHS1, which was linked to a group of transcription factors, whereas the remaining selenoproteins were linked neither to these clusters nor among themselves. The data suggest that key components of Sec machinery have already been identified and that their primary role is to support the functions of GPX4 and TXNRD1, with further functional links to PRDX6 and SCD."
109,2021,35972591,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Selenium (SeNPs) and tellurium nanoparticles (TeNPs) were synthesized by green technology using the three new bacterial marine isolates (strains PL 2476, AF 2469 and G 2451). Isolates were classified as Pseudoalteromonas shioyasakiensis according to 16S rRNA sequence analysis, morphological characteristics, and biochemical reactions. The bioreduction processes of isolates were studied in comparison with the previously described Alteromonas macleodii (strain 2328). All strains exhibited significant tolerance to selenite and tellurite up to 1000 µg/mL. A comparative analysis of the bioreduction processes of the isolates demonstrated that the strains have a high rate of reduction processes. Characterization of biogenic red SeNPs and black TeNPs using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDX analysis, Dynamic Light Scattering, and micro-Raman Spectroscopy revealed that all the isolates form stable spherical selenium and tellurium nanoparticles whose size as well as elemental composition depend on the producer strain. Nanoparticles of the smallest size (up to 100 nm) were observed only for strain PL 2476. Biogenic SeNPs and TeNPs were also characterized and tested for their antimicrobial, antifouling and cytotoxic activities. Significant antimicrobial activity was shown for nanoparticles at relatively high concentrations (500 and 1000 µg/mL), with the antimicrobial activity of TeNPs being more significant than SeNPs. In contrast, against cell cultures (breast cancer cells (SkBr3) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) SeNPs showed greater toxicity than tellurium nanoparticles. Studies have demonstrated the high antifouling effectiveness of selenium and tellurium nanoparticles when introduced into self-polishing coatings. According to the results obtained, the use of SeNPs and TeNPs as antifouling additives can reduce the concentration of leachable biocides used in coatings, reducing the pressure on the environment."
109,2021,35958612,Does selenium help prevent cancer?,selenium cancer,0.0,"Current chemotherapy strategies used in clinic appear with lots of disadvantages due to the low targeting effects of drugs and strong side effects, which significantly restricts the drug potency, causes multiple dysfunctions in the body, and even drives the emergence of diseases. Immunotherapy has been proved to boost the body's innate and adaptive defenses for more effective disease control and treatment. As a trace element, selenium plays vital roles in human health by regulating the antioxidant defense, enzyme activity, and immune response through various specific pathways. Profiting from novel nanotechnology, selenium nanoparticles have been widely developed to reveal great potential in anticancer, antibacterial, and anti-inflammation treatments. More interestingly, increasing evidence has also shown that functional selenium nanoparticles can be applied for potential immunotherapy, which would achieve more effective treatment efficiency as adjunctive therapy strategies for the current chemotherapy. By directly interacting with innate immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells, selenium nanoparticles can regulate innate immunity to intervene disease developments, which were reported to boost the anticancer, anti-infection, and anti-inflammation treatments. Moreover, selenium nanoparticles can also activate and recover different T cells for adaptive immunity regulations to enhance their cytotoxic to combat cancer cells, indicating the potential of selenium nanoparticles for potential immunotherapy strategy development. Here, aiming to enhance our understanding of the potential immunotherapy strategy development based on Se NPs, this review will summarize the immunological regulation effects of selenium nanoparticles and the application of selenium nanoparticle-based immunotherapy strategies. Furthermore, we will discuss the advancing perspective of selenium nanoparticle-based potential immunotherapy as a kind of novel adjunctive therapy to enhance the efficiency of current chemotherapies and also introduce the current obstacles for the development of selenium nanoparticles for potential immunotherapy strategy development. This work is expected to promote the future research on selenium nanoparticle-assisted immunotherapy and finally benefit the more effective disease treatments against the threatening cancer and infectious and chronic diseases."

Considering magnesium as a recommended dietary supplement during pregnancy and the possible role of magnesium deficiency in COVID-19 and its complications, the current study sought to determine the effect of magnesium and magnesium-containing nutritional supplements on the immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women, as well as to observe differences in pregnancy outcomes based on the supplements taken during pregnancy. The study followed a cross-sectional design, where patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection during their pregnancy were surveyed for their preferences in nutritional supplementation and their profile compared with existing records from the institutional database. A cohort of 448 pregnant women with COVID-19 during 22 months of the pandemic was assembled, out of which 13.6% took a magnesium-only supplement, and 16.5% supplemented their diet with a combination of calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Around 60% of patients in the no-supplementation group had the SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD lower than 500 U/mL, compared with 50% in those who took magnesium-based supplements. A quantity of magnesium &amp;gt;450 mg in the taken supplements determined higher levels of antibody titers after COVID-19. Low magnesium dosage (&amp;lt;450 mg) was an independent risk factor for a weak immune response (OR-1.25, p -value = 0.003). The observed findings suggest supplementing the nutritional intake of pregnant women with magnesium-based supplements to determine higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD antibodies, although causality remains unclear."

This study aimed to investigate the associations of the maternal total, dietary, and supplemental intakes of zinc, copper, and selenium during pregnancy with CHDs. A hospital-based case-control study was performed, including 474 cases and 948 controls in Northwest China. Eligible participants waiting for delivery were interviewed to report their diets and characteristics in pregnancy. Mixed logistic regression was adopted to examine associations and interactions between maternal intakes and CHDs. Higher total intakes of zinc, selenium, zinc to copper ratio, and selenium to copper ratio during pregnancy were associated with lower risks of total CHDs and the subtypes, and the tests for trend were significant (all p &amp;lt; 0.05). The significantly inverse associations with CHDs were also observed for dietary intakes of zinc, selenium, zinc to copper ratio, selenium to copper ratio, and zinc and selenium supplements use during pregnancy and in the first trimester. Moreover, high zinc and high selenium, even with low or high copper, showed a significantly reduced risk of total CHDs. Efforts to promote zinc and selenium intakes during pregnancy need to be strengthened to reduce the incidence of CHDs in the Chinese population."
111,2021,35168930,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,zinc supplements pregnancy,0.0,"Objectives: To compare the efficacy of bed rest, cervical cerclage (McDonald, Shirodkar, or unspecified type of cerclage), cervical pessary, fish oils or omega fatty acids, nutritional supplements (zinc), progesterone (intramuscular, oral, or vaginal), prophylactic antibiotics, prophylactic tocolytics, combinations of interventions, placebo or no treatment (control) to prevent spontaneous preterm birth in women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of spontaneous preterm birth or short cervical length. Design: Systematic review with bayesian network meta-analysis. Data sources: The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Database of Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, relevant journals, conference proceedings, and registries of ongoing trials. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Randomised controlled trials of pregnant women who are at high risk of spontaneous preterm birth because of a history of spontaneous preterm birth or short cervical length. No language or date restrictions were applied. Outcomes: Seven maternal outcomes and 11 fetal outcomes were analysed in line with published core outcomes for preterm birth research. Relative treatment effects (odds ratios and 95% credible intervals) and certainty of evidence are presented for outcomes of preterm birth 34 weeks and perinatal death. Results: Sixty one trials (17 273 pregnant women) contributed data for the analysis of at least one outcome. For preterm birth 34 weeks (40 trials, 13 310 pregnant women) and with placebo or no treatment as the comparator, vaginal progesterone was associated with fewer women with preterm birth 34 weeks (odds ratio 0.50, 95% credible interval 0.34 to 0.70, high certainty of evidence). Shirodkar cerclage showed the largest effect size (0.06, 0.00 to 0.84), but the certainty of evidence was low. 17OHPC (17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate; 0.68, 0.43 to 1.02, moderate certainty), vaginal pessary (0.65, 0.39 to 1.08, moderate certainty), and fish oil or omega 3 (0.30, 0.06 to 1.23, moderate certainty) might also reduce preterm birth 34 weeks compared with placebo or no treatment. For the fetal outcome of perinatal death (30 trials, 12 119 pregnant women) and with placebo or no treatment as the comparator, vaginal progesterone was the only treatment that showed clear evidence of benefit for this outcome (0.66, 0.44 to 0.97, moderate certainty). 17OHPC (0.78, 0.50 to 1.21, moderate certainty), McDonald cerclage (0.59, 0.33 to 1.03, moderate certainty), and unspecified cerclage (0.77, 0.53 to 1.11, moderate certainty) might reduce perinatal death rates, but credible intervals could not exclude the possibility of harm. Only progesterone treatments are associated with reduction in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis, and admission to neonatal intensive care unit compared with controls. Conclusion: Vaginal progesterone should be considered the preventative treatment of choice for women with singleton pregnancy identified to be at risk of spontaneous preterm birth because of a history of spontaneous preterm birth or short cervical length. Future randomised controlled trials should use vaginal progesterone as a comparator to identify better treatments or combination treatments. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42020169006."

Whether supplementation is similarly beneficial for the mother during gestation has received limited attention. A scoping review of human trials was conducted looking for evidence of biochemical, genomic, and clinical effects of supplementation on the maternal immune system. The authors explored the literature on PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from 2010 to the present day using PRISMA-ScR methodology. Full-length human trials in English were searched for using general terms and vitamin A, B12, C, D, and E; choline; iodine; iron; selenium; zinc; and docosahexaenoic/eicosapentaenoic acid. Of 1391 unique articles, 36 were eligible for inclusion. Diverse biochemical and epigenomic effects of supplementation were identified that may influence innate and adaptive immunity. Possible clinical benefits were encountered in malaria, HIV infections, anemia, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, and preventing preterm delivery. Only limited publications were identified that directly explored maternal immunity in pregnancy and the effects of micronutrients. None provided a holistic perspective. It is concluded that supplementation may influence biochemical aspects of the maternal immune response and some clinical outcomes, but the evidence from this review is not sufficient to justify changes to current guidelines."

Plant-based diets are more environmentally sustainable than meat-based diets and have a reduced environmental impact, including producing lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Dietary guidelines are normally formulated to enhance the health of society, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and prevent nutritional deficiencies. We reviewed the scientific data on plant-based diets to summarize their preventative and therapeutic role in cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and osteoporosis. Consuming plant-based diets is safe and effective for all stages of the life cycle, from pregnancy and lactation, to childhood, to old age. Plant-based diets, which are high in fiber and polyphenolics, are also associated with a diverse gut microbiota, producing metabolites that have anti-inflammatory functions that may help manage disease processes. Concerns about the adequate intake of a number of nutrients, including vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D, iron, zinc, and omega-3 fats, are discussed. The use of fortified foods and/or supplements as well as appropriate food choices are outlined for each nutrient. Finally, guidelines are suggested for health professionals working with clients consuming plant-based diets."
111,2021,34494118,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,zinc supplements pregnancy,0.0,"Background: Inadequate or excessive intake of micronutrients in pregnancy has potential to negatively impact maternal/offspring health outcomes. Objective: The aim was to compare risks of inadequate or excessive micronutrient intake in diverse females with singleton pregnancies by strata of maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, and prepregnancy BMI. Methods: Fifteen observational cohorts in the US Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Consortium assessed participant dietary intake with 24-h dietary recalls (n = 1910) or food-frequency questionnaires (n = 7891) from 1999-2019. We compared the distributions of usual intake of 19 micronutrients from food alone (15 cohorts; n = 9801) and food plus dietary supplements (10 cohorts with supplement data; n = 7082) to estimate the proportion with usual daily intakes below their age-specific daily Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), above their Adequate Intake (AI), and above their Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL), overall and within sociodemographic and anthropometric subgroups. Results: Risk of inadequate intake from food alone ranged from 0% to 87%, depending on the micronutrient and assessment methodology. When dietary supplements were included, some women were below the EAR for vitamin D (20-38%), vitamin E (17-22%), and magnesium (39-41%); some women were above the AI for vitamin K (63-75%), choline (7%), and potassium (37-53%); and some were above the UL for folic acid (32-51%), iron (39-40%), and zinc (19-20%). Highest risks for inadequate intakes were observed among participants with age 14-18 y (6 nutrients), non-White race or Hispanic ethnicity (10 nutrients), less than a high school education (9 nutrients), or obesity (9 nutrients). Conclusions: Improved diet quality is needed for most pregnant females. Even with dietary supplement use, &gt;20% of participants were at risk of inadequate intake of ≥1 micronutrients, especially in some population subgroups. Pregnancy may be a window of opportunity to address disparities in micronutrient intake that could contribute to intergenerational health inequalities."

Τo improve the oxidative stress status, several therapeutic interventions have been suggested. The aim of this network meta-analysis is to assess the effect of different dietary supplements on the oxidative stress status in pregnant women with GDM. Methods: A network meta-analysis of randomized control trials was performed comparing the changes delta (Δ) in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) as primary outcomes, following different therapeutic interventions with dietary supplements in pregnant women with GDM. Four electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched. The secondary outcomes were other markers of oxidative stress. Results: The meta-analysis included 16 studies of 1173 women with GDM. Regarding ΔTAC: probiotics and omega-3 with vitamin E were superior to placebo/no intervention. Regarding ΔMDA: vitamin D with calcium, omega-3, vitamin D, omega-3 with vitamin E, magnesium with zinc and calcium, and probiotics were superior to placebo/no intervention. Conclusions: Administration of dietary supplements in women with GDM can be helpful in limiting the oxidative stress which develop in these pregnancies."
111,2021,34071548,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,zinc supplements pregnancy,0.0,"The levels of many essential minerals decrease during pregnancy if un-supplemented, including calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, zinc, and possibly chromium and iodine. Sub-optimal intake of minerals from preconception through pregnancy increases the risk of many pregnancy complications and infant health problems. In the U.S., dietary intake of minerals is often below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), especially for iodine and magnesium, and 28% of women develop iron deficiency anemia during their third trimester. The goal of this paper is to propose evidence-based recommendations for the optimal level of prenatal supplementation for each mineral for most women in the United States. Overall, the evidence suggests that optimal mineral supplementation can significantly reduce a wide range of pregnancy complications (including anemia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, hyperthyroidism, miscarriage, and pre-eclampsia) and infant health problems (including anemia, asthma/wheeze, autism, cerebral palsy, hypothyroidism, intellectual disability, low birth weight, neural tube defects, preterm birth, rickets, and wheeze). An evaluation of 180 commercial prenatal supplements found that they varied widely in mineral content, often contained only a subset of essential minerals, and the levels were often below our recommendations. Therefore, there is a need to establish recommendations on the optimal level of mineral supplementation during pregnancy."
111,2021,33809457,Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy? ,zinc supplements pregnancy,0.0,"The study objective was to identify determinants of essential elements and vitamins intake, and microelements and vitamins concentration in blood among pregnant women from Poland. Based on the data from food frequency questionnaires and information about supplements taken ( n = 1252), daily supply of six elements (calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, selenium) and nine vitamins (folate, vitamins A, E, C, B1, B2, B3, B6, B12) was calculated. Zinc, copper, selenium ( n = 340), vitamin A and E ( n = 358) concentration was determined in blood collected during pregnancy. Most of the women did not meet the demand for essential elements and vitamins with a diet. About 94% of the respondents declared supplements use. The women with higher education, indicating leisure-time, physical activity and multiparity had a higher chance of meeting the average demand for the majority of the analyzed nutrients. On the other hand, factors such as BMI 18.5kg/m<sup>2</sup>, a higher level of stress, and late first medical-care visit were associated with a lower chance of meeting the recommendations. Higher socio-economic status was a determinant of a higher selenium concentration in plasma (β = 3.1; 95%CI: 0.2-5.9), whereas BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and multiparity of a higher copper concentration in plasma (β = 0.2; 95%CI: 0.03-0.4; β = 0.2; 95%CI: 0.1-0.4). Higher plasma concentration of vitamin E was noted among women older than 30 years of age comparing to those who were 30 or younger (β = 1.5; 95%CI: 0.6-2.4). Although more studies are required, especially such based on laboratory measures, our results indicate target groups for dietary interventions during pregnancy for children's optimal health and development."

Therefore, we compared the birth weights of neonates born to mothers who consumed zinc supplement during pregnancy with that of neonates born to mothers who did not. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we divided 200 pregnant mothers into two groups: case group (mothers receiving zinc supplement during pregnancy) and control group (mothers not receiving zinc supplement during pregnancy) Then, the neonate's cord zinc level and mother's serum level were measured and neonate's growth charts (weight, height and head circumference)were completed. Results: In this study, both groups of mothers were observed to have zinc deficiency; 35% of the mothers who consumed zinc supplements and 81% of the mothers who did not consume zinc supplements (P 0.001). Based on the results, maternal serum of zinc (P 0.001), neonatal birth weight (P = 0.008), maternal age (P 0.001) and parity (P 0.01) in zinc-supplemented group were higher. Neonatal birth weight was associated moderately with mother's zinc serum levels and poorly with neonatal serum zinc levels. Conclusion: Zinc consumption during pregnancy increases serum zinc level of mother and neonatal weight. Neonatal weight has a higher correlation to maternal serum zinc level."

Moisturization is the key in eczema treatment as dry skin triggers inflammation that damages the skin barrier. Thus, here we combine electrospun hydrophobic polystyrene (PS) and hydrophilic nylon 6 (PA6) with oils to create patches helping to moisturize atopic skin. The fibrous membranes manufactured using electrospinning: PS, PA6, composite PS - PA6 and sandwich system combining them were characterized by water vapor transmission rates (WVTR) and fluid uptake ability (FUA). To create the most effective moisturizing patches we use borage, black cumin seed and evening primrose oil and tested their spreading. We show a great potential of our designed patches, the oil release tests on a skin and their moisturizing effect were verified. Our results distinctly reveal that both fiber sizes and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of polymer influence oil spreading, release from membranes and WVTR measurements. Importantly, the direct skin test indicates the evident increase of hydration for both dry and normal skin after using the patches. The electrospun patches based on the hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers have outstanding properties to be used as oil carriers for atopic dermatitis treatment."

While the number of studies continues to grow, the vastness of the subject coupled with the relatively poor quality and small size of the studies limit their usefulness to clinicians. Purpose: Our aim was to comprehensively review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of complementary and alternative therapies for AD. Methods: Searches were performed on PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and the Global Resource for EczemA Trial (GREAT) databases, focusing on RCTs of alternative or complementary AD therapies, with a sample size of ≥10, through March 2015 and limited to the English language. A total of 70 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Results: There is at least some level I evidence to support the use of acupuncture and acupressure, stress-reducing techniques such as hypnosis, massage, and biofeedback, balneotherapy, herbal preparations (with many important caveats), certain botanical oils, oral evening primrose oil, vitamin D supplementation, and topical vitamin B 12 . Many other therapies either have sufficient data to suggest that they are ineffective, or simply do not have enough evidence to formulate a verdict. Conclusions: Careful review of the literature reveals several promising therapies in this domain; such findings may help direct further research that is necessary to bolster clinical recommendations for alternative or complementary treatments of AD."

For an update of systematic reviews on the epidemiology, mechanisms of disease and methodological issues, see Part 1 of this update. Based on current systematic review evidence, the most promising intervention for the prevention of AE is the use of probiotics (and possibly prebiotics) during the late stages of pregnancy and early life. Exposure to household pets, especially dogs, may also be protective, but exclusive breastfeeding for up to 7 months does not confer benefit. The role of vitamin D in preventing AE is currently unclear. Very few of the systematic reviews provided additional evidence for the use of specific treatments for AE. Further research is required to establish the role of desensitization, Chinese herbal medicines, homeopathy and specialist clothing. Nevertheless, there is now clear evidence that evening primrose oil and borage oil are not effective for the treatment of AE. There have been no randomized controlled trials on the use of H1 anti-histamines as monotherapy for the treatment of AE."
112,2021,23633319,Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,evening primrose oil eczema,0.0,"Background: Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition, which usually develops in early childhood. Many children outgrow this disorder as they reach secondary school age, and although It may improve with age, there is no cure. Constant itch makes life uncomfortable for those with this condition, no matter what age they are, so it may have a significant effect on a person's quality of life. Its prevalence seems to be increasing as populations move from rural locations to cities. Some people, who do not see an adequate improvement or fear side-effects of conventional medical products, try complementary alternatives to conventional treatment. This is a review of evening primrose oil (EPO) and borage oil (BO) taken orally (by mouth); these have been thought to be beneficial because of their gamma-linolenic acid content. Objectives: To assess the effects of oral evening primrose oil or borage oil for treating the symptoms of atopic eczema. Search methods: We searched the following databases up to August 2012: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), AMED (from 1985), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registers and checked the bibliographies of included studies for further references to relevant trials. We corresponded with trial investigators and pharmaceutical companies to try to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We performed a separate search for adverse effects of evening primrose oil and borage oil in November 2011. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled, parallel, or cross-over trials investigating oral intake of evening primrose oil or borage oil for eczema. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently applied eligibility criteria, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We pooled dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR), and continuous outcomes using the mean difference (MD). Where possible, we pooled study results using random-effects meta-analysis and tested statistical heterogeneity using both the Chi(²) test and the I(²) statistic test. We presented results using forest plots with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results: A total of 27 studies (1596 participants) met the inclusion criteria: 19 studies assessed evening primrose oil, and 8 studies assessed borage oil. For EPO, a meta-analysis of results from 7 studies showed that EPO failed to significantly increase improvement in global eczema symptoms as reported by participants on a visual analogue scale of 0 to 100 (MD -2.22, 95% CI -10.48 to 6.04, 176 participants, 7 trials) and a visual analogue scale of 0 to 100 for medical doctors (MD -3.26, 95% CI -6.96 to 0.45, 289 participants, 8 trials) compared to the placebo group.Treatment with BO also failed to significantly improve global eczema symptoms compared to placebo treatment as reported by both participants and medical doctors, although we could not conduct a meta-analysis as studies reported results in different ways. With regard to the risk of bias, the majority of studies were of low risk of bias; we judged 67% of the included studies as having low risk of bias for random sequence generation; 44%, for allocation concealment; 59%, for blinding; and 37%, for other biases. Implications for practice: Oral borage oil and evening primrose oil lack effect on eczema; improvement was similar to respective placebos used in trials. Oral BO and EPO are not effective treatments for eczema.In these studies, along with the placebos, EPO and BO have the same, fairly common, mild, transient adverse effects, which are mainly gastrointestinal.The short-term studies included here do not examine possible adverse effects of long-term use of EPO or BO. A case report warned that if EPO is taken for a prolonged period of time (more than one year), there is a potential risk of inflammation, thrombosis, and immunosuppression; another study found that EPO may increase bleeding for people on Coumadin® (warfarin) medication. Implications for research: Noting that the confidence intervals between active and placebo treatment are narrow, to exclude the possibility of any clinically useful difference, we concluded that further studies on EPO or BO for eczema would be hard to justify.This review does not provide information about long-term use of these products."

As a result, many turn to dietary supplements as a possible treatment approach, often with the belief that some essential ingredient is 'missing' in their diet. Various supplements have been proposed, but it is unclear whether any of these interventions are effective. Objectives: To evaluate dietary supplements for treating established atopic eczema/dermatitis.Evening primrose oil, borage oil, and probiotics are covered in other Cochrane reviews. Search methods: We searched the following databases up to July 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), ISI Web of Science, GREAT (Global Resource of EczemA Trials) database, and reference lists of articles. We searched ongoing trials registers up to April 2011. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of dietary supplements for the treatment of those with established atopic eczema/dermatitis. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts, read the full text of the publications, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Main results: We included 11 studies with a total of 596 participants. Two studies assessed fish oil versus olive oil or corn oil placebo. The following were all looked at in single studies: oral zinc sulphate compared to placebo, selenium versus selenium plus vitamin E versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, vitamin D versus vitamin E versus vitamins D plus vitamin E together versus placebo, pyridoxine versus placebo, sea buckthorn seed oil versus sea buckthorn pulp oil versus placebo, hempseed oil versus placebo, sunflower oil (linoleic acid) versus fish oil versus placebo, and DHA versus control (saturated fatty acids of the same energy value). Two small studies on fish oil suggest a possible modest benefit, but many outcomes were explored. A convincingly positive result from a much larger study with a publicly-registered protocol is needed before clinical practice can be influenced. Authors' conclusions: There is no convincing evidence of the benefit of dietary supplements in eczema, and they cannot be recommended for the public or for clinical practice at present. Whilst some may argue that at least supplements do not do any harm, high doses of vitamin D may give rise to serious medical problems, and the cost of long-term supplements may also mount up."

112,2021,18691244,Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,evening primrose oil eczema,0.0,"This review summarizes clinically important findings from 19 systematic reviews published between January 2006 and August 2007 on the topic of atopic eczema (AE). The evidence suggests that avoidance of allergenic foods during pregnancy or the use of hydrolyzed or soy formula milks does not prevent eczema. Delayed introduction of solids may decrease eczema risk. Asthma typically develops in around a third of children with eczema, and wheezing in early infancy is a predictor of risk. Established topical corticosteroids such as betamethasone should be used just once daily. Topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus can be used for people who become dependent on topical corticosteroids, especially on sensitive sites such as the face. Wet wraps are useful in secondary care for inducing remission in a child, but they are not a treatment for mild eczema and they should not be used long term. Oral ciclosporin can be used for inducing a remission in severe eczema, and azathioprine can be considered for maintenance treatment. Narrowband ultraviolet (UV)B phototherapy can be used for chronic AE, and UVA1 may be useful for acute eczema. There is little convincing evidence of a clinical benefit with evening primrose oil for eczema, but there is some good new evidence that educational support to eczema families is beneficial. Future trials need to be larger, and include active comparators, patient-reported outcomes and longer-term aspects of disease control. They should be better reported, and registered on a public clinical trials register."
112,2021,12390044,Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,evening primrose oil eczema,0.0,"Eczema in childhood is almost always atopic eczema, a common disease with huge impact on the quality of life of the child and family. Although atopic eczema constitutes part of the atopic syndrome, avoidance of allergens is never enough for disease control. Treatment of eczema in childhood has the same components as in adults. Emollients constitute the preventive background therapy in all stages of eczema, and topical corticosteroids are still the mainstay of treatment. Infectious exacerbation may require the use of a short course of topical or systemic antimicrobials. UV phototherapy should be considered as an adjunctive treatment to assist topical corticosteroids after an acute exacerbation of the disease. Cyclosporine can also be used in the treatment of childhood eczema in severe cases. Maternal allergen avoidance for disease prevention, oral antihistamines, Chinese herbs, dietary restriction in established atopic eczema, homeopathy, house-dust mite reduction, massage therapy, hypnotherapy, evening primrose oil, emollients, and topical coal tar are other temporarily used treatment modalities, without, however, firm evidence of efficacy from proper controlled trials. Calcineurin inhibitors constitute a new generation of drugs for both adult and childhood eczema already marketed in some countries. It is postulated that they will replace topical corticosteroids as first-line treatment of eczema."
112,2021,11134919,Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,evening primrose oil eczema,0.0,"Background: Atopic eczema is the commonest inflammatory skin disease of childhood, affecting 15-20% of children in the UK at any one time. Adults make up about one-third of all community cases. Moderate-to-severe atopic eczema can have a profound effect on the quality of life for both sufferers and their families. In addition to the effects of intractable itching, skin damage, soreness, sleep loss and the social stigma of a visible skin disease, other factors such as frequent visits to doctors, special clothing and¿the need to constantly apply messy topical applications all add to the burden of disease. The cause of atopic eczema is unknown, though a genetic pre-disposition and a combination of allergic and non-allergic factors appear to be important in determining disease expression. Treatment of atopic eczema in the UK is characterised by a profusion of treatments aimed at disease control. The evidential basis of these treatments is often unclear. Most people with atopic eczema are managed in primary care where the least research has been done. Objectives: The objectives of this scoping review are two-fold. To produce an up-to-date coverage 'map' of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments of atopic eczema. To assist in making treatment recommendations by summarising the available RCT evidence using qualitative and quantitative methods. Data sources: Data sources included electronic searching of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register, the Cochrane Skin Group specialised register of trials, hand-searching of atopic eczema conference proceedings, follow-up of references in retrieved articles, contact with leading researchers and requests to relevant pharmaceutical companies. Inclusion/exclusion criteria: Only RCTs of therapeutic agents used in the prevention and treatment of people with atopic eczema of any age were considered for inclusion. Only studies where a physician diagnosed atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis were included. Data extraction: Data extraction was conducted by two observers onto abstraction forms, with discrepancies resolved by discussion. Quality assessment: The quality assessment of retrieved RCTs included an assessment of: a clear description of method and concealment of allocation of randomisation, the degree to which assessors and participants were blinded to the study interventions, and whether all those originally randomised were included in the final main analysis. Data synthesis: Where possible, quantitative pooling of similar RCTs was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration's methods. Where statistical heterogeneity was found, sources of heterogeneity in terms of study participants, formulation or posology of intervention, and use of co-treatments were explored. Where pooling was not deemed to be appropriate, detailed descriptions of the study characteristics and main reported results were presented along with comments on study quality. Results: A total of 1165 possible RCTs were retrieved in hard copy form for further scrutiny. Of these, 893 were excluded from further analysis because of lack of appropriate data. The 272 remaining RCTs of atopic eczema covered at least 47 different interventions, which could be broadly categorised into ten main groups. Quality of reporting was generally poor, and limited statistical pooling was possible only for oral cyclosporin, and only then after considerable data transformation. There was reasonable RCT evidence to support the use of oral cyclosporin, topical corticosteroids, psychological approaches and ultraviolet light therapy. There was insufficient evidence to make recommendations on maternal allergen avoidance for disease prevention, oral antihistamines, Chinese herbs, dietary restriction in established atopic eczema, homeopathy, house dust mite reduction, massage therapy, hypnotherapy, evening primrose oil, emollients, topical coal tar and topical doxepin.

115,2021,34959985,Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,magnesium migraine prevention,1.0,"The mechanisms of migraine pathogenesis are not completely clear, but <sup>31</sup>P-nuclear magnetic resonance studies revealed brain energy deficit in migraineurs. As glycolysis is the main process of energy production in the brain, mitochondria may play an important role in migraine pathogenesis. Nutrition is an important aspect of migraine pathogenesis, as many migraineurs report food-related products as migraine triggers. Apart from approved anti-migraine drugs, many vitamins and supplements are considered in migraine prevention and therapy, but without strong supportive evidence. In this review, we summarize and update information about nutrients that may be important for mitochondrial functions, energy production, oxidative stress, and that are related to migraine. Additionally, we present a brief overview of caffeine and alcohol, as they are often reported to have ambiguous effects in migraineurs. The nutrients that can be considered to supplement the diet to prevent and/or ameliorate migraine are riboflavin, thiamine, magnesium ions, niacin, carnitine, coenzyme Q10, melatonin, lipoic acid, pyridoxine, folate, and cobalamin. They can supplement a normal, healthy diet, which should be adjusted to individual needs determined mainly by the physiological constitution of an organism. The intake of caffeine and alcohol should be fine-tuned to the history of their use, as withdrawal of these agents in regular users may become a migraine trigger."
115,2021,33827421,Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,magnesium migraine prevention,1.0,"Objective: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of concurrent magnesium-sodium valproate therapy and compare it with either magnesium or sodium valproate alone in migraine prophylaxis. Materials and methods: This randomized single-center double-blind parallel-group controlled clinical trial study was conducted on migraine patients within the age range of 18-65 years. The subjects with at least four monthly attacks were randomly assigned to group A (n = 82) sodium valproate, group B (n = 70) magnesium with sodium valproate, and group C (n = 70) magnesium. The patients passed a one-month baseline without prophylactic therapy and then received a 3-month treatment. The characteristics of migraine, including frequency, severity, duration of the attacks, and the number of painkillers taken per month, were monthly recorded in each visit. The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) and Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) scores were recorded at the baseline and after 3 months of treatment in each group. Within- and between-group analyses were performed in this study. Results: The obtained results revealed a significant reduction in all migraine characteristics in all groups compared to those reported for the baseline (P 0.001). Intragroup data analysis indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in headache frequency between groups A and B in the third month (P = 0.525); nevertheless, three other parameters showed a significant reduction in group B, compared to those reported for group A in the third month (P 0.05). On the other hand, group C could not effectively reduce measured parameters in the patients, compared to groups A and B after 3 months (P 0.001). Furthermore, the MIDAS and HIT-6 scores significantly diminished in groups A, B, and C compared to those reported at the baseline (P 0.001), and these changes were more significant in groups A and B than in group C (P 0.001). Conclusion: The obtained results of this study revealed that magnesium could enhance the antimigraine properties of sodium valproate in combination therapy and reduce the required valproate dose for migraine prophylaxis."
115,2021,33433020,Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,magnesium migraine prevention,1.0,"Background: Primary headaches (migraine, tension headache, cluster headache, and other trigeminal autonomic cephalgias) are common in pregnancy and postpartum. It is unclear how to best and most safely manage them. Objective: We conducted a systematic review (SR) of interventions to prevent or treat primary headaches in women who are pregnant, attempting to become pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Database of SRs, and Epistemonikos for primary studies of pregnant women with primary headache and existing SRs of harms in pregnant women regardless of indication. No date or language restrictions were applied. We assessed strength of evidence (SoE) using standard methods. Results: We screened 8549 citations for studies and 2788 citations for SRs. Sixteen studies (mostly high risk of bias) comprising 14,185 patients (total) and 26 SRs met the criteria. For prevention, we found no evidence addressing effectiveness. Antiepileptics, venlafaxine, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, β-blockers, prednisolone, and oral magnesium may be associated with fetal/child adverse effects, but calcium channel blockers and antihistamines may not be (1 single-group study and 11 SRs; low-to-moderate SoE). For treatment, combination metoclopramide and diphenhydramine may be more effective than codeine for migraine or tension headache (1 randomized controlled trial; low SoE). Triptans may not be associated with fetal/child adverse effects (8 nonrandomized comparative studies; low SoE). Acetaminophen, prednisolone, indomethacin, ondansetron, antipsychotics, and intravenous magnesium may be associated with fetal/child adverse effects, but low-dose aspirin may not be (indirect evidence; low-to-moderate SoE). We found insufficient evidence regarding non-pharmacologic treatments. Conclusions: For prevention of primary headache, calcium channel blockers and antihistamines may not be associated with fetal/child adverse effects. For treatment, combination metoclopramide and diphenhydramine may be more effective than codeine. Triptans and low-dose aspirin may not be associated with fetal/child adverse effects. Future research should identify effective and safe interventions in pregnancy and postpartum."

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that migraine is the third most prevalent medical disorder and second most disabling neurological condition in the world. There are several options for preventive migraine treatments that include, but are not limited to, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, botulinum toxins, NSAIDs, riboflavin, and magnesium. Patients may also benefit from adjunct nonpharmacological options in the comprehensive prevention of migraines, such as cognitive behavior therapy, relaxation therapies, biofeedback, lifestyle guidance, and education. Preventative therapies are an essential component of the overall approach to the pharmacological treatment of migraine. Comparative studies of newer therapies are needed to help patients receive the best treatment option for chronic migraine pain."
115,2021,31691193,Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,magnesium migraine prevention,1.0,"Migraine is one of the most common recurrent types of headache and is the seventh cause of disability. This neurological disorder is characterized by having pain in head and other various symptoms such as nausea, emesis, photophobia, phonophobia, and sometimes visual sensory disorders. Magnesium (Mg) is a necessary ion for human body and has a crucial role in health and life maintenance. One of the main roles of Mg is to conserve neurons electric potential. Therefore, magnesium deficiency can cause neurological complications. Migraine is usually related to low amounts of Mg in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Deficits in magnesium have significant role in the pathogenesis of migraine. Mg has been extensively used in migraine prophylaxis and treatment. This review summarizes the role of Mg in migraine pathogenesis and the potential utilizations of Mg in the prevention and treatment of migraine with the emphasis on transdermal magnesium delivery."
115,2021,30798472,Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,magnesium migraine prevention,1.0,"Migraine is a disabling disorder that affects the quality of life of patients. Different medications have been used in prevention of migraine headache. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of magnesium oxide in comparison with valproate sodium in preventing migraine headache attacks. This is a single-center, randomized, controlled, crossover trial which is double-blind, 24-week, 2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment. After patient randomization into two sequences, the intervention group received magnesium oxide 500 mg and the control group received valproate sodium 400 mg two tablets each day (every 12 h) for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was reduction in the number of migraine attacks and number of days with moderate or severe headache and hours with headache (duration) per month in the final of 8 weeks in comparison with baseline. Seventy patients were randomized and seven dropped out, leaving 63 for analysis. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 31 patients were in group 1 (magnesium oxide-valproate) and 32 patients were in group 2 (valproate-magnesium oxide). The mean number of migraine attacks and days per month was 1.72 ± 1.18 and 2.09 ± 1.70, with a mean duration of 15.50 ± 21.80 h in magnesium group and 1.27 ± 1.27 and 2.22 ± 1.96, with a mean duration 13.38 ± 14.10 in valproate group. This study has shown that 500 mg magnesium oxide appears to be effective in migraine prophylaxis similar to valproate sodium without significant adverse effect."
115,2021,30600979,Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,magnesium migraine prevention,1.0,"Migraines impose significant health and financial burdens. Approximately 38% of patients with episodic migraines would benefit from preventive therapy, but less than 13% take prophylactic medications. Preventive medication therapy reduces migraine frequency, severity, and headache-related distress. Preventive therapy may also improve quality of life and prevent the progression to chronic migraines. Some indications for preventive therapy include four or more headaches a month, eight or more headache days a month, debilitating headaches, and medication-overuse headaches. Identifying and managing environmental, dietary, and behavioral triggers are useful strategies for preventing migraines. First-line medications established as effective based on clinical evidence include divalproex, topiramate, metoprolol, propranolol, and timolol. Medications such as amitriptyline, venlafaxine, atenolol, and nadolol are probably effective but should be second-line therapy. There is limited evidence for nebivolol, bisoprolol, pindolol, carbamazepine, gabapentin, fluoxetine, nicardipine, verapamil, nimodipine, nifedipine, lisinopril, and candesartan. Acebutolol, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, and telmisartan are ineffective. Newer agents target calcitonin gene-related peptide pain transmission in the migraine pain pathway and have recently received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; however, more studies of long-term effectiveness and adverse effects are needed. The complementary treatments petasites, feverfew, magnesium, and riboflavin are probably effective. Nonpharmacologic therapies such as relaxation training, thermal biofeedback combined with relaxation training, electromyographic feedback, and cognitive behavior therapy also have good evidence to support their use in migraine prevention."
115,2021,30291554,Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,magnesium migraine prevention,1.0,"Purpose of review: To review the pathophysiologic, epidemiologic, and clinical evidence for similarities and differences between migraine with and without aura. Recent findings: The ICHD-3 has recently refined the diagnostic criteria for aura to include positive symptomatology, which better differentiates aura from TIA. Although substantial evidence supports cortical spreading depression as the cause of visual aura, the role (if any) of CSD in headache pain is not well understood. Recent imaging evidence suggests a possible hypothalamic origin for a headache attack, but further research is needed. Migraine with aura is associated with a modest increase in the risk of ischemic stroke. The etiology for this association remains unclear. There is a paucity of evidence regarding treatments specifically aimed at the migraine with aura subtype, or whether migraine with vs without aura responds to treatment differently. Migraine with typical aura is therefore often treated similarly to migraine without aura. Lamotrigine, daily aspirin, and flunarizine have evidence for efficacy in prevention of migraine with aura, and magnesium, ketamine, furosemide, and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation have evidence for use as acute treatments. Although triptans have traditionally been contraindicated in hemiplegic migraine and migraine with brainstem aura, this prohibition is being reconsidered in the face of evidence suggesting that use may be safe. The debate as to whether migraine with and without aura are different entities is ongoing. In an era of sophisticated imaging, genetic advancement, and ongoing clinical trials, efforts to answer this question are likely to yield important and clinically meaningful results."
115,2021,30074549,Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,magnesium migraine prevention,1.0,"Purpose of review: This article reviews the preventive therapy of migraine, including indications, strategies for use, and available treatments. Recent findings: Lifestyle modifications and migraine trigger avoidance are recommended as preventive measures for all individuals with migraine. The decision to recommend additional migraine preventive therapy should consider the frequency of migraine attacks and headaches, extent of migraine-associated disability, frequency of using acute migraine treatments and the responsiveness to such treatments, and patient preferences. Additional therapies include prescription medications, nutraceuticals, neurostimulation, and behavioral therapy. Considering evidence for efficacy and the risk of potential side effects and adverse events, treatments with the most favorable profiles include (in alphabetical order): amitriptyline, beta-blockers (several), biofeedback, candesartan, coenzyme Q10, cognitive-behavioral therapy, magnesium citrate, onabotulinumtoxinA (for chronic migraine only), relaxation therapy, riboflavin, and topiramate. In addition, erenumab, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor monoclonal antibody, received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of migraine in May 2018. Summary: Successful migraine preventive therapy reduces the frequency and burden of attacks while causing limited side effects. Individual treatment recommendations are determined based upon evidence for efficacy, side effect and adverse event profiles, medication interactions, patient comorbidity, costs, and patient preferences. Patients must be counseled on reasonable expectations for their preventive therapy and the importance of adhering to the recommended treatment plan for a period of time that is sufficient to determine outcomes."
115,2021,29882776,Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,magnesium migraine prevention,1.0,"Magnesium is well known for its diverse actions within the human body. From a neurological standpoint, magnesium plays an essential role in nerve transmission and neuromuscular conduction. It also functions in a protective role against excessive excitation that can lead to neuronal cell death (excitotoxicity), and has been implicated in multiple neurological disorders. Due to these important functions within the nervous system, magnesium is a mineral of intense interest for the potential prevention and treatment of neurological disorders. Current literature is reviewed for migraine, chronic pain, epilepsy, Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s, Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s, and stroke, as well as the commonly comorbid conditions of anxiety and depression. Previous reviews and meta-analyses are used to set the scene for magnesium research across neurological conditions, while current research is reviewed in greater detail to update the literature and demonstrate the progress (or lack thereof) in the field. There is strong data to suggest a role for magnesium in migraine and depression, and emerging data to suggest a protective effect of magnesium for chronic pain, anxiety, and stroke. More research is needed on magnesium as an adjunct treatment in epilepsy, and to further clarify its role in Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s and Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s. Overall, the mechanistic attributes of magnesium in neurological diseases connote the macromineral as a potential target for neurological disease prevention and treatment."

Aerobic Training (AT) and Vitamin D (Vit D) supplementation are among the approaches that improve lipid profile and liver enzymes in T2DM. However, the mechanisms responsible for these improvements are not fully elucidated. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of AT and Vit D supplementation on lipid profile, liver enzymes, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Cluster of differentiation 27 (CD27), Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 13 (CXCL13), Interferon-Gamma (IFN-γ) and Transforming Growth Factor-Beta 1 (TGF-β1) gene expressions in patients with T2DM. Methods: In this study, 40 male T2DM patients aged 35-50 years were randomly selected and assigned into four groups (n = 10 for each); AT+vitamin D supplementation (AT+Vit D), AT+placebo (AT), Vit D supplementation (Vit D), and control+placebo (C). The intervention consisted of 8 weeks of 20-40 minutes AT protocol at 60-75% HR max 3 sessions/week and taking 50,000 IU of Vit D supplement once a week. Serum levels of lipid profile and liver enzymes and gene expression of IL-6, IL-10, CD27, CXCL13, IFN-γ, and TGF-β1 in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were measured. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey's post hoc, and paired sample t-test at P-values less than 0.05 were used to analyze the data using SPSS software. Results: AT+Vit D, AT, and Vit D significantly decreased TC, TG, LDL, AST, ALT, and GGT while increased HDL after 8 weeks in favor of AT+Vit D. Also, gene expressions of IL-6, IL-10, CD27, CXCL13, IFN-γ, and TGF-β1 were downregulated significantly in AT+Vit D, AT, and Vit D, while upregulated in C. Furthermore, compared to individual AT or Vit D, AT+Vit D significantly downregulated IL-6 (P = 0.013; P = 0.025), IL-10 (P = 0.012; P = 0.026), CD27 (P = 0.023; P = 0.041), CXCL13 (P = 0.014; P = 0.025), IFN-γ (P = 0.017; P = 0.026), and TGF-β1 (P = 0.001; P = 0.028). Conclusion: In comparison to individual AT or Vit D, AT+Vit D may enhance lipid profile, and liver enzymes and drive the balance to favor inhibition of inflammation by downregulating gene expression of inflammation-related factors. As a result, AT+Vit D may be considered appropriate therapy for managing T2DM."

Methods: A total of 96 patients with GDM admitted to our hospital between March 2018 and January 2020 were recruited and assigned to receive either routine nursing (routine group) or targeted care plus exercise intervention (study group) via random method, with 48 patients in each group. Outcome measures included blood glucose, immune function, maternal and newborn outcome, and nursing satisfaction. Results: The patients in the study group had significantly lower amniotic fluid index (AFI), weight at delivery, body mass index (BMI), and weight gain during pregnancy than patients in the routine group ( P 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in blood glucose between the two groups of patients before the intervention ( P &gt; 0.05). Targeted care plus exercise intervention resulted in significantly lower levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2 h postprandial blood glucose (2hPBG), and blood glucose before bed versus routine care ( P 0.05). The patients with targeted care plus exercise intervention had higher immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM levels; higher CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ levels; and lower lgA levels versus those with routine care ( P 0.05). Targeted care plus exercise intervention was associated with a lower incidence of negative pregnancy outcomes and a higher satisfaction versus routine care ( P 0.05). Conclusion: Targeted treatment plus exercise intervention efficiently controls blood glucose levels in GDM patients, improves immunological function, lowers the risk of pregnancy problems, improves pregnancy outcomes, and promotes patient satisfaction, indicating a high potential for therapeutic development. Targeted treatment combined with exercise intervention is encouraged following effective pharmacological interventions to facilitate recovery."
116,2021,36204396,Does exercise help manage diabetes?,exercise diabetes,1.0,"Objectives: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major global public health issue. Diet and physical exercise are modifiable factors that influence the glycaemic status of patients with T2DM. We aimed to investigate the acute effects of breakfast fruits meal sequence and postprandial exercise on the blood glucose level and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) activity among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Methods: A randomized pilot study recruited patients with T2DM who attended two primary health care centres in Tasikmadu District, Karanganyar Regency, and Kartasura District, Sukoharjo Regency, Central Java, Indonesia, from July to October 2016. Eligible patients (4 men and 32 women) were randomly divided into four treatment groups. Venous blood samples were analyzed for fasting and one-hour postprandial blood glucose (FBG and 1 h PPG) levels and DPP4 activity. Blood glucose levels were measured using a routine hexokinase method, and serum DPP4 activity was determined spectrophotometrically after incubation with the Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide substrate. Results: Fruits last meal decreased FBG level whilst fruits first meal did not significantly decrease 1 h PPG level. Both treatments had no acute effects on DPP4 activity but the addition of postprandial exercise helped lower DPP4 activity. Fruit last and first meals showed significant opposite effects on mean changes of FBG level ( p 0.05). Conclusions: This preliminary report of fruits meal sequence is potentially involved in acute regulation of blood glucose levels and that it might be independent of DPP4 activity in Indonesian patients with T2DM. Moreover, postprandial exercise may be an important intervention for T2DM through the mediation of DPP4 but has no acute effects on the regulation of blood glucose levels. Further studies are required to investigate whether or not different types of fruits and longer treatment intervals can affect blood glucose levels and DPP4 activity differently. This study also gives an insight into the feasibility of conducting food order modification with or without the combination of postprandial exercise in a primary health setting for our next studies."

There were 167 AS patients enrolled in the cross-sectional study. Blood pressure was measured and the presence of hypertension was recorded. Patient's disease severity, including disease activity, functional ability, patient's global assessments, physical mobility and radiographic damage were evaluated. ESR and CRP levels were tested. We recorded patient's medication use of NSAIDs, DMARDs and TNF-α blockers. Smoking, exercise habit, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and obesity indices were assessed. Multivariate linear regression showed that systolic blood pressure was associated with TNF-α blocker [standard coefficient (β) = 0.194, P = .007], DMARDs (β = 0.142, P = .046), age (β = 0.211, P = .003), male gender (β = 0.242, P = .001) and body mass index (BMI) (β = 0.245, P = .001). Diastolic blood pressure was associated with cervical rotation (β = -0.174, P = .037), lateral lumbar flexion (β = -0.178, P = .019), m-SASSS (β = 0.198, P = .038) and BMI (β = 0.248, P = .003).

Using ROC cure analyses, age, BASMI, BASRI-Total, m-SASSS, waist circumference, BMI and waist-to-height ratio were useful in predicting hypertension, and m-SASSS is the best (AUC = 0.784, P .001). Advanced radiographic damage is an independent risk factor of hypertension in AS, and m-SASSS is the most useful disease severity parameter in predicting the presence of hypertension. Advanced radiographic damage, poor cervical rotation, lateral lumbar flexion, older age, male gender, TNF-α blocker, DMARDs use and obesity are associated with increased blood pressure."

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on selected physical and psychological parameters, exercise, and nutritional behaviors in diabetic patients. Patients and methods: This was a cross-sectional study of volunteers with type 2 diabetes. Patients were randomized into two groups: an intervention (n=32) and a control group (n=31). The Beck Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to assess physical activity in combination with the Beck Depression Inventory and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess the levels of depression and the quality of sleep. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) training consisted of six sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy interventions. The intervention consisted of a face-to-face individual counseling session. The patients received a special diet according to their basal metabolic rate (BMR). At all sessions, dietary advice was reviewed, and during the treatment period, they were asked to record their diet and physical activity. Body composition and blood samples were measured before and after three months of the experiment for both groups. Results: Blood glucose, blood lipid profiles (except high-density lipoprotein), lifestyle, behavior patterns and body composition were significantly improved following CBT intervention (p≤0.05).

Patients and methods: 276 patients included in the study were divided into two groups (1:1); liraglutide (3 mg) + metformin combination (L+M) and metformin monotherapy (M) (2x1,000 mg) (exercise and diet were regulated in both groups). Patients' body composition measurements were performed and fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, HbA1c, triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL levels were measured by TANITA device prior to the therapy and in the week 12 of the therapy. Results: The average age of 276 patients included in the study was 49.70±7.93 years. A statistically significant decrease was noted in weight, BMI, fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, HbA1c values of both groups at the end of the third month. 11.3 kg of weight was lost on average in L+M group (-12.3%); 4.5 kg of weight was lost in the monotherapy group (-4.9%). A decrease of 14.3% was seen in the body fat mass, 2.1% in the muscle mass in L+M group and a decrease of 4.4% in the body fat mass and 6.1% in the muscle mass in the monotherapy group. The decrease in the body fat was higher at a statistically significant level in L+M group and the decrease in the muscle mass was higher in the monotherapy group. HbA1c decreased by 17.9% in L+M group (-1.49±0.46, Cohen's d=2.68), 5.3% in the monotherapy group (-0.37±0.26, Cohen's d=0.90). The decrease in TG, total cholesterol, LDL was higher at a statistically significant level in L+M group. The increase in HDL level was higher in the monotherapy group (L+M=22.7%, M=35.4%).

116,2021,36180857,Does exercise help manage diabetes?,exercise diabetes,1.0,"Background: In a cohort of primary health care users across Kosovo (KOSCO cohort), high rates and poor control of diabetes and hypertension were observed. These conditions can be prevented and better controlled by adapting to a healthy lifestyle. Physical activity is an important target, as inactivity and related obesity were very prevalent in the KOSCO cohort. This qualitative study aims to identify individual and structural barriers to physical activity perceived by patients with diabetes and/or hypertension so as to inform health care providers and policy-makers in Kosovo on strategies for promoting physical activity. Methods: Interviews were conducted from July to October 2020 with 26 public primary health care users from five municipalities of Kosovo (Mitrovica, Vushtrri, Fushe Kosova, Gjakova, and Malisheva). The qualitative study was nested into the KOSCO cohort. KOSCO was implemented in 2019 and recruited consecutive patients visiting the public primary health care centres in these municipalities. Participants of this qualitative sub-study were selected if they had a doctor's diagnosis of diabetes and/or hypertension. The interview guide consisted of questions related to physical activity barriers these patients are facing, despite having received motivational counselling sessions in primary healthcare centres. Data were analysed using a framework methodology. Results: Three main themes moderating physical activity behaviour were identified: 1) neighbourhood built environment, 2) health-related problems, and 3) social support. The barriers to physical activity related to the first theme were structural features of the neighbourhoods such as: crowded sidewalks, lack of green spaces, lack of proper lighting in public spaces, as well as dense traffic. In regards to the second theme, the main health reasons for study participants to delay physical activity were related to: physical discomfort as well as stress, worry, and lack of energy. An additional barrier to exercise was lack of social support specifically from friends. Conclusion: The study identifies structural and individual targets for integrated and inter-sectoral physical activity promotion efforts."
116,2021,36177924,Does exercise help manage diabetes?,exercise diabetes,1.0,"Objective: To compare the effectiveness of Logistic regression, BP neural network and support vector machine models in the prediction of 30-day risk of readmission in elderly patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to provide a scientific basis for the screening and prevention of high-risk patients with readmission. Methods: The COPD patient survey questionnaire was made, including the general data questionnaire, modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (mMRC), activities of daily living (ADL), the geriatric depression scale, the mini nutritional assessment-short form (MNA-SF) and COPD assessment test (CAT). Elderly COPD patients were selected from the department of respiratory medicine of 13 general hospitals in Ningxia from April 2019 to August 2020 by convenience sampling method, and they were followed up 30 days after discharge. To explore the risk factors of patient readmission, Logistic regression model, BP neural network model and support vector machine models were constructed based on the risk factors. According to the ratio of the training set to the testing set of 7:3, the model was divided into the training set sample and the testing set sample. The prediction efficiency of the model was compared by the precision rate, recall rate and accuracy rate, F1 index and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Results: A total of 1 120 patients were investigated, including 879 non-readmission patients and 241 readmission patients. Univariate regression analysis showed that there were statistically significant differences in age, education level, smoking status, proportion of diabetes and coronary heart disease, hospitalization times of acute exacerbation of COPD in the past 1 year, seasonal factors and long-term home oxygen therapy, regular medication, proportion of rehabilitation exercise, course of disease, ADL, depression status, mMRC, nutritional status between non-readmission patients and readmission patients. Binary Logistic regression analysis showed that education level, smoking status, coronary heart disease, hospitalization times of acute exacerbation of COPD in the past 1 year, seasonal factors, whether long-term home oxygen therapy, whether regular medication, nutritional status were the risk factors for 30-day acute exacerbation of readmission in elderly patients with COPD. The training set showed that the accuracy rate of Logistic regression model, BP neural network model and support vector machine models were 70.95%, 76.51% and 84.78%, respectively. The recall rates were 79.55%, 86.36% and 88.64%, respectively. The accuracy rates were 87.81%, 90.81% and 93.82%, respectively. F1 indexes were 0.75, 0.81 and 0.87, respectively. The AUC were 0.850, 0.893 and 0.921, respectively. The testing set showed that the precision rate of Logistic regression model, BP neural network model and support vector machine model were 78.38%, 80.65% and 88.57%, respectively. The recall rates were 70.73%, 60.98% and 75.61%, respectively. The accuracy rates were 85.82%, 84.40% and 90.07%, respectively. F1 indexes were 0.74, 0.69 and 0.82, respectively. The AUC were 0.814, 0.775 and 0.858, respectively. Conclusions: Comparing with Logistic regression and BP neural network, support vector machine model has better prediction effect, and can effectively predict the risk of acute exacerbation of readmission in elderly patients with COPD within 30 days."
116,2021,36176473,Does exercise help manage diabetes?,exercise diabetes,1.0,"Circadian rhythm, an innate 24-h biological clock, regulates several mammalian physiological activities anticipating daily environmental variations and optimizing available energetic resources. The circadian machinery is a complex neuronal and endocrinological network primarily organized into a central clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and peripheral clocks. Several small molecules generate daily circadian fluctuations ensuring inter-organ communication and coordination between external stimuli, i.e., light, food, and exercise, and body metabolism. As an orchestra, this complex network can be out of tone. Circadian disruption is often associated with obesity development and, above all, with diabetes and cardiovascular disease onset. Moreover, accumulating data highlight a bidirectional relationship between circadian misalignment and cardiometabolic disease severity. Food intake abnormalities, especially timing and composition of meal, are crucial cause of circadian disruption, but evidence from preclinical and clinical studies has shown that food could represent a unique therapeutic approach to promote circadian resynchronization. In this review, we briefly summarize the structure of circadian system and discuss the role playing by different molecules [from leptin to ghrelin, incretins, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15)] to guarantee circadian homeostasis. Based on the recent data, we discuss the innovative nutritional interventions aimed at circadian re-synchronization and, consequently, improvement of cardiometabolic health."

The aim of the present study was to analyze differences in nutritional and psychological habits in humans with hypertension. Fifty participants with hypertension (HG) (57.5 ± 13.6 years) and 100 participants as control group (CG) with no hypertension disease (48.9 ± 7.9 years) were interviewed via online questionnaire. Multifactorial items in nutrition habits and psychological profile were analyzed by a compendium of questionnaires; psychological measures refer to personality, anxiety, depression, loneliness, perceived stress, and psychological inflexibility; and a nutritional questionnaire to analyze eating habits and nutrition behaviors of the participants. CG showed significantly higher week vitality ( p = 0.001), juice weekly consumption ( p = 0.011), coffee weekly consumption ( p = 0.050), fermented milk weekly consumption ( p = 0.004), and fruit weekly consumption ( p = 0.022) than HG. Lower values of weekly coffee consumption and week vitality were found in HG. According to the psychological profile, significant differences were found only depression values, finding HG more depressed than CG ( p = 0.002). In conclusion, our results showed that people with better nutrition and mental health would present lower levels of blood pressure. Therefore, the combination of psychological therapy and nutritional recommendations for reducing the risk of having hypertension and improving the blood pressure levels may be needed for patient with hypertension."

Studies investigating the effects of traditional fermented foods on metabolic syndrome are limited. We hypothesized that regular kefir consumption could improve the anthropometrical measurements, glycemic control, lipid profile, blood pressure, and inflammatory status in patients with metabolic syndrome. Sixty-two participants were randomly assigned to receive either 180 mL/d probiotic kefir or unfermented milk for 12 weeks. Dietary intake, anthropometrical measurements, biochemical status, and blood pressure were assessed at baseline and the end of weeks 4, 8, and 12. Serum apolipoprotein A1 concentration increased by 3.4% in the kefir group, whereas it decreased by 2.4% in the milk group in 12 weeks (P = .03). A subgroup analysis for participants with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels &gt;130 mg/dL showed that serum LDL-C and apolipoprotein B concentrations (7.6% and 5.4%, respectively) significantly decreased with kefir consumption compared with the baseline values at the 12th week (P .05), but not compared with milk consumption (P &gt; .05). Both milk and kefir consumption was associated with lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared with the baseline (P .05). The 12-weeks of kefir administration also decreased serum tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 6, interleukin 10, interferon-gamma, and homocysteine concentrations significantly (P .05). In conclusion, regular dairy consumption as part of a well-balanced diet can provide favorable effects in the management of metabolic syndrome, and probiotic kefir may deserve a special interest among dairy products.

117,2021,35255289,Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,fermented milk blood pressure,0.0,"Objectives: In a previous study, a mushroom was shown to digest milk protein to a mixture of oligopeptides and free amino acids. The aim of this study was to examine effects of this mixture, i.e., mushroom-fermented milk, on blood pressure and stroke susceptibility in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Materials and methods: Rats were fed mushroom-fermented milk with or without 1 % salt water. Blood pressure was monitored either by the tail-cuff method or the telemetry system. Symptoms of stroke were examined every day to determine the stroke latency. Results: Mushroom-fermented milk at 120 mg/Kg BW/day (estimated as a peptides/amino acids content) did not ameliorate hypertension in SHRSP. In contrast, mushroom-fermented milk significantly improved stroke susceptibility under salt-loading. The effects were replicated using milk fermented with three different mushrooms. To elucidate the effective components in mushroom-fermented milk, spermidine (3 mM), one of major components of mushroom-fermented milk, and a mixture of amino acids (0.8 g/L) was examined, both of which showed no significant effects on stroke susceptibility. Intake of mushroom-fermented milk did not affect sodium content significantly either in feces or in urine of the rats given 1% salt water. This observation indicated sodium absorption by the digestive system was not inhibited by intake of mushroom-fermented milk. Conclusion: Despite that the mechanisms were not elucidated, intake of mushroom-fermented milk effectively prevented stroke in SHRSP. Mushroom-fermented milk would be a new candidate for a supplemental nutrient supporting the cardiovascular health."
117,2021,34657947,Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,fermented milk blood pressure,0.0,"Hypertension has become an increasing health concern given that it is a major risk for cardiovascular disease. Synthetic antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, effectively control high blood pressure but are associated with unpleasant side effects. Milk fermented by certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) provides energetic contributions to the management of hypertension, especially the regulation of ACE. LAB are important food-grade microbial organisms that release ACE inhibitory peptides through their unique proteolysis system, which consists of cell-envelope proteinases (CEPs), transporter systems, and intracellular peptidases. Thus, the description of LAB proteolysis system genes and their contributions to ACE inhibitory peptide production is a challenging but promising study. This review provides a survey of LABs with potential ACE inhibitory activity and investigates the research progress of LAB proteolytic systems with an emphasis on the correlation of their components and ACE inhibitory activity. Subsequently, a depiction of the ACE inhibitory peptide action mechanism, structure-activity relationship and bioavailability is presented. The improved functional annotation of LAB proteolytic system genes will provide an excellent framework for future experimental validations of predicted ACE inhibitory activity in fermented milk."
117,2021,34444905,Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,fermented milk blood pressure,0.0,"Gamma -amino butyric acid (GABA) is marketed in the U.S. as a dietary supplement. USP conducted a comprehensive safety evaluation of GABA by assessing clinical studies, adverse event information, and toxicology data. Clinical studies investigated the effect of pure GABA as a dietary supplement or as a natural constituent of fermented milk or soy matrices. Data showed no serious adverse events associated with GABA at intakes up to 18 g/d for 4 days and in longer studies at intakes of 120 mg/d for 12 weeks. Some studies showed that GABA was associated with a transient and moderate drop in blood pressure ( 10% change). No studies were available on effects of GABA during pregnancy and lactation, and no case reports or spontaneous adverse events associated with GABA were found. Chronic administration of GABA to rats and dogs at doses up to 1 g/kg/day showed no signs of toxicity. Because some studies showed that GABA was associated with decreases in blood pressure, it is conceivable that concurrent use of GABA with anti-hypertensive medications could increase risk of hypotension. Caution is advised for pregnant and lactating women since GABA can affect neurotransmitters and the endocrine system, i.e., increases in growth hormone and prolactin levels."
117,2021,33985895,Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,fermented milk blood pressure,0.0,"Aims: With an increase in the number of published prospective cohort studies, we sought to summarize the relationship between dairy products consumption and the risk of hypertension (HTN). Data synthesis: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Science direct, and Scopus. Pooled RRs and 95% CIs were calculated using a random effects model. The certainty of the evidence was assessed by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Sixteen studies were included in the current meta-analysis. We found an inverse association between total dairy products (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.94; n = 16), low-fat dairy products (RR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.96; n = 8), milk (RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.99; n = 11), and fermented dairy (RR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.99; n = 8) consumption and the risk of HTN. However, in subgroup analysis, despite a significant association for total dairy products in women, Americans, longer and larger studies, and self-reported HTN, no associations were found in males, Europeans, or Asians, and studies which followed participants for 10 years or had 3000 participants or measured HTN. Dose-response analysis revealed a non-linear association between total dairy products and milk consumption and the risk of HTN, but a linear association for low-fat dairy products. Conclusions: Higher dairy products consumption was associated with reduced risk of HTN. This association was dependent on sex, geographical region of study, and the stage of HTN. However, the certainty of the evidence was graded either as low or very low."
117,2021,32746616,Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,fermented milk blood pressure,0.0,"Dairy products have an important role in a healthy diet due to their high-quality protein and rich micronutrients. Yogurt, a fermented milk product, has a similar composition to milk but is a more concentrated product in terms of group B vitamins, minerals, and proteins. It is known that bioactive metabolites and live enzymes that occur by fermentation and digestion, affect the health positively by improving gut microbiota. In recent years, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, which threatens public health, is increasing rapidly. As with other noninfectious diseases, the diet has an important effect on the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome. It has been demonstrated that yogurt has a high-quality amino acid pattern, reduces energy intake by stimulating satiety, and regulates blood glucose level. In addition to the rich protein variety, yogurt also contains peptides that positively affect blood pressure. Unlike milk, increased acidity during the fermentation of yogurt positively affects calcium absorption. Calcium plays an important role in the control of blood glucose and energy metabolism through insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent routes. In addition to reducing inflammation, calcium has a positive effect on the regulation of the blood lipid profile by increasing fecal fat excretion. There are many lipid and lipoid nutrients such as saturated fatty acids, phospholipids, sphingolipids, and conjugated linoleic acid that may affect the blood lipid profile in yogurt positively or negatively. There are seen very few randomized controlled studies that are focused on the relationship between yogurt and metabolic syndrome, and these are based on contradictory results. In this review, based on the clinical studies conducted to date, and the nutrient content of yogurt, possible mechanisms of these contradictory results are investigated."

The aim of our study is to investigate the role of probiotics support therapy in blood pressure and, as a kind of convenient and economic drugs for prevention and auxiliary treatment of hypertension. Materials and methods: We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis to examine the effect of probiotics consumption on blood pressure. Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Clinical trials, CNKI and the Cochrane library were searched. Also, the grey literature and references were searched. Results: Twenty-three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2037 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included. Probiotic consumption significantly changed systolic blood pressure (SBP) by - 3.05 mmHg (95%CI: - 4.67, - 1.44; P 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by - 1.51 mmHg (95%CI: - 2.38, - 0.65; P = 0.001). Subgroup analysis indicated that the benefit effect of probiotics supplementation in SBP was only observed in hypertension [weight mean difference (WMD) = - 3.31 mmHg, 95%CI: - 5.71, - 0.92; P = 0.007] or type 2 diabetes (WMD = -4.85 mmHg, 95%CI: - 9.28, - 0.42; P = 0.032) patients, and the decreased DBP level by probiotics supplementation was only observed in hypertension patients (WMD = -2.02 mmHg, 95%CI: - 3.68, - 0.36; P = 0.017).This effect could only last for a short-term time of 8 or 10 weeks, but not for a long-term time. Conclusion: This meta-analysis found a moderate and statistically significant reduction for either SBP or DBP with probiotics supplement compared with controls. Thus, probiotics is a potential for the dietary treatment of hypertension."

The peptide was subsequently derived from an α S1 -casein, κ-casein, β-lactoglobulin, or serum albumin fraction. Analysis via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry indicated that it had an amino acid sequence of Gly-Ala (GA). The GA dipeptide was also synthesized using an Fmoc solid-phase method. The GA dipeptide exhibited an IC 50 of 1.22 mg/mL and was shown to be stable across both temperature (20 to 60°C) and pH (2 to 12). Digestive enzymes including pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin had negligible effects on activity. The whey exerted hypotensive effects when fed to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which exhibited a blood pressure drop of 2.33 kPa. A 4-wk gavage treatment resulted in greater decreases of 7.46 kPa. Results of this study indicate that milk fermented using Lb. plantarum QS306 has potential to be used as a functional food to help prevent or reduce hypertension-associated diseases."

The present study aims to further address this association by cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluation of the associations between exposure to various types of dairy products and metabolic risk markers among inhabitants in northern Sweden while taking other lifestyle factors into account. Methods: Respondents in the Västerbotten Intervention Programme with complete and plausible diet data between 1991 and 2016 were included, yielding 124,934 observations from 90,512 unique subjects. For longitudinal analysis, 27,682 participants with a visit 8-12 years after the first visit were identified. All participants completed a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire. Metabolic risk markers, including body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, serum (S) cholesterol and triglycerides, and blood glucose, were measured. Participants were categorized into quintiles by intake of dairy products, and risk (odds ratios, OR) of undesirable levels of metabolic risk markers was assessed in multivariable logistic regression analyses. In longitudinal analyses, intake quintiles were related to desirable levels of metabolic risk markers at both visits or deterioration at follow-up using Cox regression analyses. Results: The OR of being classified with an undesirable BMI decreased with increasing quintiles of total dairy, cheese and butter intake but increased with increasing non-fermented milk intake. The OR of being classified with an undesirable S-cholesterol level increased with increasing intake of total dairy, butter and high fat (3%) non-fermented milk, whereas an undesirable S-triglyceride level was inversely associated with cheese and butter intake in women. In longitudinal analyses, increasing butter intake was associated with deterioration of S-cholesterol and blood glucose levels, whereas increasing cheese intake was associated with a lower risk of deterioration of S-triglycerides. Conclusions: Confounding factors likely contribute to the demonstrated association between dairy intake and mortality, and other medical conditions and analyses should be stratified by dairy type."

The mounting evidence suggests a link between HLA-G gene polymorphisms, disease susceptibility and methotrexate treatment response. Various environmental factors influence the onset and progression of RA and its treatment outcomes. The aim is to identify the treatment response of HLA-G 3' untranslated region polymorphisms to yoga-based lifestyle intervention (YBLI). Methods: In this eight-week single-blinded randomized controlled trial (CTRI/2017/05/008589), patients with RA (n=140) were randomized into two groups namely, yoga group or non-yoga group. Baseline genomic DNA was isolated using salting-out method. PCR-based methods were used for genotyping. The levels of soluble (s) HLA-G and disease activity were assessed by ELISA and disease activity score-28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), respectively, at baseline (day 0) and after eight weeks of intervention. Results: Low-producing sHLA-G genotypes, i.e. +3142GG and 14 bp ins/ins, showed a significant increase in sHLA-G levels after YBLI. The association analysis between HLA-G polymorphisms and treatment for RA showed no considerable differential treatment remission in either of the groups (P&gt;0.05). The percentages of improvement were higher in the yoga group as compared to the non-yoga group in both the HLA-G +3142G&gt;C and 14 bp ins/del polymorphisms irrespective of their respective genotypes. No significant association was found between sHLA-G levels and disease activity with respect to genotypes. Interpretation &amp; conclusions: Yoga intervention results in improvement and reduced severity of RA in patients irrespective of the HLA-G 14 bp ins/del or +3142G&gt;C polymorphisms. YBLI may be used as an adjunct therapy in RA independent of the genotypes."

119,2021,35099279,Does yoga help reduce pain from arthritis and improve physical function?,yoga arthritis,1.0,"Objectives: Accumulated evidence garnered in the last few decades has highlighted the role of yoga in health and disease. The overwhelming mortality and morbidity mediated by noncommunicable epidemics such as heart disease and cancer have fostered a search for mechanisms to attenuate them. Despite overwhelming success in acute care, the efficacy of modern medicines has been limited on this front. Yoga is one of the integrative therapies that has come to light as having a substantial role in preventing and mitigating such disorders. It thus seems trite to analyze and discuss the research advancements in yoga for 2020. The present review attempts to distill recent research highlights from voluminous literature generated in 2020. Methods: This review was conducted on the articles published or assigned to an issue in 2020. The authors searched the PubMed database for clinical studies published in the English language, using yoga (including meditation) as the intervention, and having an adequate description of the intervention. Then, they extracted data from each study into a standardized Google sheet. Results: A total of 1149 citations were retrieved in the initial search. Of these, 46 studies met eligibility criteria and were finally included. The studies were predominantly on mental health and neuropsychology, addressing various issues such as anxiety, postural balance, migraine, academic performance, and childhood neglect. Anxiety, stress, and depression were other common denominators. Eight studies were on cardiorespiratory systems, including exercise capacity, cardiac rehabilitation, myocardial infarction, and hypertension. Three studies were on diabetes, evaluating the effect of yoga. Five studies focused on cognition, health status, and autonomic regulation and few others included cancers, infertility, ulcerative colitis, urinary incontinence, restless leg syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pain, and metabolic syndrome. Finally, most studies were on noncommunicable diseases with one exception, human immunodeficiency virus; two randomized controlled trials were dedicated to it. Conclusions: Yoga has been studied under a wide variety of clinicopathological conditions in the year 2020. This landscape review intends to provide an idea of the role of yoga in various clinical conditions and its future therapeutic implications."

Among the most challenging extraintestinal symptoms are depression and fatigue, which are also frequent in other chronic diseases like multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Yoga as an ancient Indian tradition containing postures, breathing exercises and meditation may positively influence those symptoms. This review evaluates the current literature with regard to the effect of yoga-based interventions in persons with IBD and with regard to QoL, depression and fatigue in other somatic disorders. A systematic literature search yielded three trials examining the effects of yoga in patients with IBD and 37 trials addressing depressive syndromes or fatigue in somatic disorders. In summary, both in-person and video-based yoga classes are feasible, acceptable and safe as complementary treatment in patients with IBD and significantly improve anxiety and impaired quality of life. Current literature does not provide information on the effect of yoga on depression and fatigue in patients with IBD, but research from other somatic disorders or patients with depressive disorders implies the potential of yoga in this regard for persons with IBD. This should be specifically addressed in interventional trials with standardized yoga modules including patients with IBD suffering from fatigue, depression and/or impaired QoL."

119,2021,33741520,Does yoga help reduce pain from arthritis and improve physical function?,yoga arthritis,1.0,"Background: Oxidative stress (OS) and mitochondrial alterations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Various environmental triggers like air pollutants, smoking, unhealthy social habits and sedentary lifestyle induce OS, which may compromise mitochondrial integrity. This trial was designed to explore the effect of 8-weeks yoga practice on mitochondrial health and disease severity in an active RA group compared with a usual-care control group. Methods: A total of 70 subjects were randomized into two groups: yoga group and non-yoga group. Mitochondrial health was assessed by calculation of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN), OS markers, mitochondrial activity, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), circadian rhythm markers and transcripts associated with mitochondrial integrity: AMPK, TIMP-1, KLOTHO, SIRT-1, and TFAM. Parameters of disease activity and disability quotient were also assessed by disease activity score - erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) and health assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-DI), respectively. Results: In yoga group, there was a significant upregulation of mtDNA-CN, mitochondrial activity markers, ΔΨm, and transcripts that maintain mitochondrial integrity after 8-weeks of yoga. There was optimization of OS markers, and circadian rhythm markers post 8-weeks practice of yoga. Yoga group participants showed significant improvements in DAS28-ESR (p 0.05) and HAQ-DI (p 0.05) over the non-yoga group. Conclusion: Adoption of yoga by RA patients holds the key to enhance mitochondrial health, improve circadian rhythm markers, OS marker regulation, upregulation of transcripts that maintain mitochondrial integrity, reduce disease activity and its associated consequences on health outcome and hence can be beneficial as an adjunct therapy."
119,2021,33636297,Does yoga help reduce pain from arthritis and improve physical function?,yoga arthritis,1.0,"Purpose: The aim was to compare the effects of yoga and home exercise program on lower extremity functional status, pain, and quality of life in children with enthesitis related arthritis (ERA). Methods: Twenty-one children with ERA were divided into two groups as yoga (n = 11) and home exercise (n = 10). Yoga group performed supervised yoga exercises twice a week for eight weeks. Home exercise group performed video-based exercises for the same period. Pain in rest and activity, lower extremity functional status, and quality of life were evaluated at baseline and following eight weeks. Results: The groups were similar at baseline (p &gt; 0.05). All the parameters, except parent reported quality of life, significantly improved in yoga group (p 0.05), where only stair climb test times significantly improved in home exercise group (p 0.05). Conclusions: Yoga seems promising for improving lower extremity functional status, pain, and quality of life as an exercise intervention in rehabilitation programs of children with ERA."
119,2021,33509740,Does yoga help reduce pain from arthritis and improve physical function?,yoga arthritis,1.0,"Introduction: Neuropathic pain is a debilitating condition caused by lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. Integrative modalities such as yoga, acupuncture, and massage are evidenced therapies for pain management. Additionally, medical cannabis and cannabinoids are emerging therapies for treatment of neuropathic pain (4,28). The authors of this study report a case of chronic neuropathic pain treated with integrative interventions. Case presentation: The patient is a 71-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic neuropathic pain in her lower back and legs, degenerative arthritis, restless leg syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, and severe, chronic anxiety, presenting with worsening neuropathic pain. After over a decade of unsuccessful allopathic treatment, the patient sought out a more integrative approach to her pain management. A regimen of acupuncture, massage, gentle yoga, and medical cannabis was recommended. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she was unable to continue most of the integrative modalities and reported a significant increase in pain. The patient then joined a weekly Mind and Body program and began acupuncture treatments again, reporting a steady improvement in pain. Conclusion: The patient's chronic neuropathic pain was effectively treated using an integrative approach, with a combination of acupuncture, massage, yoga, mind-body approaches, and medical cannabis. While this case originally presented similarly to other cases of chronic neuropathic pain, it is unique in that it demonstrates the importance of an individualized complex approach, highlighting the patient's driven engagement in integrative modalities and medical cannabis."

120,2021,27613076,Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,imitrex migraine,1.0,"Objective/background: Intranasal sumatriptan (Imitrex<sup>®</sup> ) may be an alternative for patients who refuse injections and cannot tolerate oral agents, but due to low bioavailability and slow absorption, the clinical utility of the currently marketed formulation is limited, highlighting an unmet need for an effective non-oral migraine medication with a rapid onset of action. To overcome the slow absorption profile associated with intranasal administration, we evaluated the impact of 1-O-n-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM, Intravail A-3™), a permeation enhancer, on sumatriptan's pharmacokinetic profile by comparing the pharmacokinetic characteristics of two commercial sumatriptan products, 4 mg subcutaneous and 6 mg subcutaneous in healthy adults, with DFN-02 - a novel intranasal agent comprised of sumatriptan 10 mg plus 0.20% DDM. We also determined the pharmacokinetic characteristics of DDM and evaluated its safety and tolerability. Methods: We conducted two studies: a randomized, three-way crossover study comparing monodose and multidose devices for delivery of single doses of DFN-02 with commercially available intranasal sumatriptan 20 mg in 18 healthy, fasted adults, and an open-label, randomized, single-dose, three-way crossover bioavailability study comparing DFN-02 with 4 mg and 6 mg subcutaneous sumatriptan in 78 healthy, fasted adults. In the study comparing DFN-02 with IN sumatriptan, subjects received a single dose of DFN-02 (sumatriptan 10 mg plus DDM 0.20%) via monodose and multidose delivery systems with at least 5 days between treatments. In the comparison with SC sumatriptan, subjects received a single dose of each treatment with at least 3 days between treatments. In both studies, blood was sampled for pharmacokinetic evaluation of sumatriptan and DDM through 24 hours post-dose; safety and tolerability were monitored throughout. Results: In the comparison with commercially available intranasal sumatriptan 20 mg, DFN-02 had a more rapid absorption profile; t max was 15 minutes for DFN-02 monodose, 10.2 minutes for DFN-02 multidose, and 2.0 hours for commercially available intranasal sumatriptan 20 mg. Compared with 4 and 6 mg subcutaneous sumatriptan, DFN-02's median t max (10 minutes) was significantly earlier (15 minutes; P .0001). Mean sumatriptan exposure metrics were similar for DFN-02 and 4 mg sumatriptan: AUC 0-2 : 35.12 and 44.82 ng*hour/mL, respectively; AUC 0-∞ : 60.70 and 69.21 ng*hour/mL, respectively; C max : 51.79 and 49.07 ng/mL, respectively. With 6 mg subcutaneous sumatriptan, these exposure metrics were about 50% larger (AUC 0-2 : 67.17 ng*hour/mL; AUC 0-∞ : 103.78 ng*hour/mL; C max : 72.75 ng/mL). Inter-subject variability of AUC 0-2 , AUC 0-∞ , and C max was 42-58% for DFN-02, 15-22% for 4 mg subcutaneous sumatriptan, and 15-25% for 6 mg subcutaneous sumatriptan. DDM exposure was low (mean C max : 1.63 ng/mL), t max was 30 minutes, and it was undetectable by 4 hours. There were no serious adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, or remarkable findings for vital signs, physical examinations (including nasal and injection site examinations), or clinical laboratory assessments. The overall incidence of adverse events was comparable across treatments, and all treatment-related events were mild in severity. Adverse events occurring in ≥10% of subjects were dysgeusia (19%), headache (18%), nausea (15%), paresthesia (15%), and dizziness (12%). Conclusions: In healthy subjects, DFN-02, an intranasal spray containing 10 mg sumatriptan plus DDM, had a more rapid absorption profile than commercially available intranasal sumatriptan 20 mg, and systemic exposure from a single-dose administration of DFN-02 was similar to 4 mg SC sumatriptan and two-thirds that of 6 mg SC sumatriptan. With DFN-02, plasma sumatriptan peaked 5 minutes earlier than with both subcutaneous formulations. Systemic exposure to sumatriptan was similar with DFN-02 and 4 mg subcutaneous sumatriptan; both yielded lower systemic exposure than 6 mg subcutaneous sumatriptan. Systemic exposure to DFN-02's excipient DDM was short-lived. DFN-02's safety and tolerability appear to be comparable to subcutaneous sumatriptan. Addition of a permeation enhancer improved the absorption profile compared with commercially available intranasal sumatriptan 20 mg."

The prepared SS ODT formulae were evaluated regarding hardness, friability, simulated wetting time, and in vitro disintegration and dissolution tests. Different mucoadhesive polymers-HPMC K4M, Carbopol®, chitosan, or Polyox®-were tested aiming to increase the residence time in the sublingual area. A pharmacokinetic study on healthy human volunteers was performed, using LC/MS/MS assay, to compare the optimum sublingual formula (Ph25/HPMC) with the conventional oral tablet Imitrex®. Results showed that tablets prepared using Pharmaburst® had significantly (p 0.05) the lowest simulated wetting and in vitro disintegration times of 17.17 and 23.50 s, respectively, with Q 5 min of 83.62%. HPMC showed a significant (p 0.05) increase in the residence time from 48.44 to 183.76 s. The relative bioavailability was found to be equal to 132.34% relative to the oral tablet Imitrex®.

Objectives: To investigate whether a needle-free system can deliver s.c. sumatriptan. If so, to examine whether needle-free administration is bioequivalent to a 26-gauge needle-based auto-injector. Lastly, to assess the needle-free system for clinical acceptability and ease of use during migraine attacks. Methods: Two clinical trials. Study A: Pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence was studied in normal adult volunteers (n = 57 total), directly comparing needle-free (Sumavel DosePro) with needle-based (Imitrex STATdose System) administration of 6 mg s.c. sumatriptan. An incomplete, randomized, partial factorial, crossover design was used. Each subject received 2 administrations of each product, at 2 of the 3 anatomical sites (abdomen, thigh or arm). There were appropriate ""washout"" periods between each. Pharmacokinetic sampling was at standard time points, and tests for bioequivalence then followed. Study B: The term ""ease of use"" was used for clinical acceptability and utility of the needle-free system when it was assessed among 52 outpatients treating migraine attacks. Instructional materials were used as would be provided after ordinary prescription. The primary endpoint was successful use of the needle-free system to administer sumatriptan at the first attempt, including appropriate injection site selection. Second and subsequent uses of the needle-free system were also documented. Results: For administration sites in the thigh and the abdomen, but not the arm, the needle-free and needle-based systems were bioequivalent (for all pharmacokinetic endpoints the mean ratios between the 2 devices were always between 90.1% and 115%). Among outpatients treating a migraine attack with the needle-free system, 51 of 52 on first attempt used the needle-free system successfully when treating a migraine attack. Conclusions: Sumavel DosePro needle-free delivery system is a new presentation of s.c. sumatriptan that delivers drug effectively, is bioequivalent to the existing needle auto-injector when used at the thigh or abdomen, and is easy to use."

Parallel discoveries in the fields of pharmacology, physiology, genetics and other biomedical disciplines will lead to the development of optimal migraine therapeutics. Such discoveries have already yielded some major enhancement in acute migraine treatment with the development of sumatriptan (Imitrex, GlaxoSmithKline) and other triptans and the trajectory is likely to be exponential. Novel targets, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists and inhibitors of excitatory glutamatergic receptors, are leading the pack but many other promising targets are in development.

Potential predictors were demographic characteristics, chronotype, dim light melatonin onset, the number of days the LT lamp was used, the daily duration of LT, daytime sleepiness, anxiety, depression, worry, and rumination. Significant advances were observed in sleep onset and sleep offset from baseline to the end of treatment. The number of days of LT predicted earlier sleep onset and sleep offset."
121,2021,16076658,Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,light therapy lamp depression,1.0,"A 47-yr-old male was admitted to the Institute for Fatigue and Sleep Medicine complaining of severe fatigue and daytime sleepiness. His medical history included diagnosis of depression and chronic fatigue syndrome. Antidepressant drugs failed to improve his condition. He described a gradual evolvement of an irregular sleep-wake pattern within the past 20 yrs, causing marked distress and severe impairment of daily functioning. He had to change to a part-time position 7 yrs ago, because he was unable to maintain a regular full-time job schedule. A 10-day actigraphic record revealed an irregular sleep-wake pattern with extensive day-to-day variability in sleep onset time and sleep duration, and a 36 h sampling of both melatonin level and oral temperature (12 samples, once every 3 h) showed abnormal patterns, with the melatonin peak around noon and oral temperature peak around dawn. Thus, the patient was diagnosed as suffering from irregular sleep-wake pattern. Treatment with melatonin (5 mg, 2 h before bedtime) did not improve his condition. A further investigation of the patient's daily habits and environmental conditions revealed two important facts. First, his occupation required work under a daylight intensity lamp (professional diamond-grading equipment of more than 8000 lux), and second, since the patient tended to work late, the exposure to bright light occurred mostly at night. To recover his circadian rhythmicity and stabilize his sleep-wake pattern, we recommended combined treatment consisting of evening melatonin ingestion combined with morning (09:00 h) bright light therapy (0800 lux for 1 h) plus the avoidance of bright light in the evening. Another 10-day actigraphic study done only 1 wk after initiating the combined treatment protocol revealed stabilization of the sleep-wake pattern with advancement of sleep phase. In addition, the patient reported profound improvement in maintaining wakefulness during the day. This case study shows that chronic exposure to bright light at the wrong biological time, during the nighttime, may have serious effects on the circadian sleep-wake patterns and circadian time structure. Therefore, night bright light exposure must be considered to be a risk factor of previously unrecognized occupational diseases of altered circadian time structure manifested as irregularity of the 24 h sleep-wake cycle and melancholy."

chondroitin supplement osteoarthritis joint disorder
",1.0,"Background: Osteoarthritis, a common joint disorder, is one of the leading causes of disability. Chondroitin has emerged as a new treatment. Previous meta-analyses have shown contradictory results on the efficacy of chondroitin. This, in addition to the publication of more trials, necessitates a systematic review. Objectives: To evaluate the benefit and harm of oral chondroitin for treating osteoarthritis compared with placebo or a comparator oral medication including, but not limited to, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, opioids, and glucosamine or other ""herbal"" medications. Search methods: We searched seven databases up to November 2013, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Science Citation Index (Web of Science) and Current Controlled Trials. We searched the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) websites for adverse effects. Trial registers were not searched. Selection criteria: All randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials lasting longer than two weeks, studying adults with osteoarthritis in any joint, and comparing chondroitin with placebo, an active control such as NSAIDs, or other ""herbal"" supplements such as glucosamine. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently performed all title assessments, data extractions, and risk of bias assessments. Main results: Forty-three randomized controlled trials including 4,962 participants treated with chondroitin and 4,148 participants given placebo or another control were included. The majority of trials were in knee OA, with few in hip and hand OA. Trial duration varied from 1 month to 3 years. Participants treated with chondroitin achieved statistically significantly and clinically meaningful better pain scores (0-100) in studies less than 6 months than those given placebo with an absolute risk difference of 10% lower (95% confidence interval (CI), 15% to 6% lower; number needed to treat (NNT) = 5 (95% CI, 3 to 8; n = 8 trials) (level of evidence, low; risk of bias, high); but there was high heterogeneity between the trials (T(2) = 0.07; I(2) = 70%, which was not easily explained by differences in risk of bias or study sample size). In studies longer than 6 months, the absolute risk difference for pain was 9% lower (95% CI 18% lower to 0%); n = 6 trials; T(2) = 0.18; I(2) = 83% ), again with low level of evidence.For the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Minimal Clinically Important Improvement (WOMAC MCII Pain subscale) outcome, a reduction in knee pain by 20% was achieved by 53/100 in the chondroitin group versus 47/100 in the placebo group, an absolute risk difference of 6% (95% CI 1% to 11%), (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24; T(2) = 0.00; I(2) = 0%) (n = 2 trials, 1253 participants; level of evidence, high; risk of bias, low).Differences in Lequesne's index (composite of pain,function and disability) statistically significantly favoured chondroitin as compared with placebo in studies under six months, with an absolute risk difference of 8% lower (95% CI 12% to 5% lower; T(2)= 0.78; n = 7 trials) (level of evidence, moderate; risk of bias, unclear), also clinically meaningful. Loss of minimum joint space width in the chondroitin group was statistically significantly less than in the placebo group, with a relative risk difference of 4.7% less (95% CI 1.6% to 7.8% less; n = 2 trials) (level of evidence, high; risk of bias, low). Chondroitin was associated with statistically significantly lower odds of serious adverse events compared with placebo with Peto odds ratio of 0.40 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.82; n = 6 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Chondroitin did not result in statistically significant numbers of adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events compared with placebo or another drug. Adverse events were reported in a limited fashion, with some studies providing data and others not.Comparisons of chondroitin taken alone or in combination with glucosamine or another supplement showed a statistically significant reduction in pain (0-100) when compared with placebo or an active control, with an absolute risk difference of 10% lower (95% CI 14% to 5% lower); NNT = 4 (95% CI 3 to 6); T(2) = 0.33; I(2) = 91%; n = 17 trials) (level of evidence, low). For physical function, chondroitin in combination with glucosamine or another supplement showed no statistically significant difference from placebo or an active control, with an absolute risk difference of 1% lower (95% CI 6% lower to 3% higher with T(2) = 0.04; n = 5 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Differences in Lequesne's index statistically significantly favoured chondroitin as compared with placebo, with an absolute risk difference of 8% lower (95% CI, 12% to 4% lower; T(2) = 0.12; n = 10 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Chondroitin in combination with glucosamine did not result in statistically significant differences in the numbers of adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, or in the numbers of serious adverse events compared with placebo or with an active control.The beneficial effects of chondroitin in pain and Lequesne's index persisted when evidence was limited to studies with adequate blinding or studies that used appropriate intention to treat (ITT) analyses. These beneficial effects were uncertain when we limited data to studies with appropriate allocation concealment or a large study sample (&gt; 200) or to studies without pharmaceutical funding. Authors' conclusions: A review of randomized trials of mostly low quality reveals that chondroitin (alone or in combination with glucosamine) was better than placebo in improving pain in participants with osteoarthritis in short-term studies. The benefit was small to moderate with an 8 point greater improvement in pain (range 0 to 100) and a 2 point greater improvement in Lequesne's index (range 0 to 24), both seeming clinically meaningful. These differences persisted in some sensitivity analyses and not others. Chondroitin had a lower risk of serious adverse events compared with control. More high-quality studies are needed to explore the role of chondroitin in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The combination of some efficacy and low risk associated with chondroitin may explain its popularity among patients as an over-the-counter supplement."
125,2021,36065644,Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,omega-3 fatty acids hypertriglyceridemia,1.0,"High levels of triglycerides (TG) and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRLs) confer a residual risk of cardiovascular disease after optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapy. Consensus has been made that LDL-C is a non-arguable primary target for lipid lowering treatment, but the optimization of TGRL for reducing the remnant risk of cardiovascular diseases is urged. Omega-3 fatty acids and fibrates are used to reduce TG levels, but many patients still have high TG and TGRL levels combined with low high-density lipoprotein concentration that need to be ideally treated. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key regulator for TGs that hydrolyzes TGs to glycerol and free fatty acids in lipoprotein particles for lipid storage and consumption in peripheral organs. A deeper understanding of human genetics has enabled the identification of proteins regulating the LPL activity, which include the apolipoproteins and angiopoietin-like families. Novel therapeutic approach such as antisense oligonucleotides and monoclonal antibodies that regulate TGs have been developed in recent decades. In this article, we focus on the biology of LPL and its modulators and review recent clinical application, including genetic studies and clinical trials of novel therapeutics. Optimization of LPL activity to lower TG levels could eventually reduce incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in conjunction with successful LDL-C reduction."
125,2021,35895246,Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,omega-3 fatty acids hypertriglyceridemia,1.0,"Purpose of review: Mounting evidence continues to support the causal role of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Substantial residual ASCVD risk remains among high-risk patients who have elevated triglycerides despite reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statin therapy. Ongoing research efforts have focused on evaluating triglyceride-lowering therapies among patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Recent findings: The REDUCE-IT trial showed that the addition of icosapent ethyl, a highly purified form of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), can reduce vascular events among statin-treated individuals with elevated triglycerides who have either clinical ASCVD or diabetes plus another risk factor. Although additional evidence for EPA has emerged from other trials, conflicting results have been reported by subsequent trials that tested different omega-3 fatty acid formulations. Randomized clinical trials have not demonstrated incremental ASCVD benefit of fibrates on background of statin therapy, but fibrates are used to help prevent pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Selective inhibitors of apolipoprotein C-III (apoC3) and angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), proteins that are involved in metabolism of TRLs by regulating lipoprotein lipase, have been tested in selected patient populations and showed significant reduction in triglyceride and LDL-C levels. Statin therapy continues to be the cornerstone of pharmacologic reduction of cardiovascular risk. High-dose EPA in the form of icosapent ethyl has been demonstrated to have cardiovascular benefit on top of statins in persons with elevated triglycerides at high ASCVD risk. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating novel selective therapies such as apoC3 and ANGPTL3 inhibitors."
125,2021,35876118,Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,omega-3 fatty acids hypertriglyceridemia,1.0,"Introduction: REDUCE-IT demonstrated that adding 4 g/day of icosapent ethyl (IPE; purified ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]) to statins substantially reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, with few adverse effects. These data prompted numerous leading medical societies across five continents, including the American College of Cardiology, the European Society of Cardiology, and the Japanese Circulation Society, to update their guidelines or scientific/consensus statements to recommend use of IPE for primary and secondary prevention of CVD events. Areas covered: This review discusses the incorporation of IPE into international guidelines and scientific statements, noting areas of consensus and distinction. As background, this review also describes the CVD benefits and risks of IPE as a statin adjunct, and outlines current data regarding the potential mechanisms of CVD risk reduction by EPA (as IPE) beyond triglyceride reduction. Expert opinion/commentary: IPE is unique among 'triglyceride-lowering' treatments in having strong CVD outcomes data and, therefore, a broad international consensus among professional medical society guidelines and statements endorsing its use for CVD risk reduction in patients generally meeting REDUCE-IT inclusion criteria. IPE should be considered for CVD prevention as a statin adjunct in all such patients. Plain Language SummaryCardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Statin monotherapy is conventionally used first-line to reduce the risk of CV events, such as heart attacks and strokes, in patients with elevated cholesterol. However, considerable risk remains despite appropriate control of cholesterol levels with a statin. Consequently, research has focused on treatment of additional therapeutic targets to reduce this remaining CV risk. One such target is elevated blood triglyceride levels. Unfortunately, most drugs that lower triglyceride levels, such as niacin, fibrates, and mixed omega-3 fatty acids, have not reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials when added to statin therapy. However, the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid ('EPA') administered in highly purified form as icosapent ethyl (IPE) has emerged as the first omega-3 fatty acid, and the first triglyceride-lowering agent to prevent CV events when added to statins. This was demonstrated most notably in the pivotal REDUCE-IT trial, in which IPE reduced the risk of major CV events by 25% in high-risk patients with mildly to moderately elevated triglyceride levels despite statin-controlled cholesterol levels. The mechanisms responsible for this reduction in CV events appear to go far beyond lowering triglyceride levels alone. In light of the positive results from the REDUCE-IT trial, IPE was approved for CV disease risk reduction globally, including in the United States, Canada, European Union, and the United Kingdom, and its use is being increasingly endorsed in United States and international statements and guidelines for managing CV risk. Despite minor differences among guidelines, there is strong consensus that IPE should be considered for use in CVD prevention in all patients who meet the proposed criteria."

The currently available medications to decrease triglyceride levels, such as fibrates, statins, and omega‑3 fatty acids, are in many cases not able to achieve normal triglyceride levels. Therefore, new drugs are in development to address this unmet need. Recently, icosapent ethyl, a purified formulation of the omega-3-fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid, was approved in Germany for the reduction of cardiovascular events in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and established cardiovascular disease or with diabetes and other risk factors on top of statins. Other new drugs in development are the more selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) modulator, pemafibrate, already approved for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in Japan, and inhibitors of ApoC-III and angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) in the form of antisense oligonucleotides or siRNAs or fully human monoclonal binding antibodies. Apolipoprotein C-III and ANGPTL3 protein seem to be quite promising targets based on solid genetic data. Larger studies of long duration, many of them currently ongoing, are needed to establish the role these medications will play in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in clinical practice."

Compared with icosapent ethyl (EPA-ethyl esters [EE]), EPA+DPA-FFA previously showed enhanced triglyceride lowering and higher plasma EPA when both were administered once daily with a very-low fat diet. This trial compared pharmacodynamic responses and plasma omega-3 levels following twice daily dosing, with meals, of EPA+DPA-FFA and EPA-EE in hypertriglyceridemic subjects consuming a Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet. Methods and Results This open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover trial, with 28-day treatment periods separated by ≥28-day washout, was conducted at 8 US centers and included 100 subjects with fasting triglycerides 1.70 to 5.64 mmol/L (150-499 mg/dL) (median 2.31 mmol/L [204 mg/dL]; 57% women, average age 60.3 years). The primary end point was least squares geometric mean percent change from baseline plasma triglycerides. In the 94 subjects with analyzable data for both treatment periods, EPA+DPA-FFA and EPA-EE reduced least squares geometric mean triglycerides from baseline: 20.9% and 18.3%, respectively ( P =not significant). EPA+DPA-FFA reduced least squares geometric mean high-sensitivity C-reactive protein by 5.8%; EPA-EE increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein by 8.5% ( P =0.034). EPA+DPA-FFA increased least squares geometric mean plasma EPA, DPA, and total omega-3 (EPA+docosahexaenoic acid+DPA) concentrations by 848%, 177%, and 205%, respectively, compared with corresponding changes with EPA-EE of 692%, 140%, and 165% (all P 0.001). EPA+DPA-FFA increased docosahexaenoic acid by 1.7%; EPA-EE decreased docosahexaenoic acid by 3.3% ( P =0.011). Lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein responses did not differ between treatments. Conclusions EPA+DPA-FFA raised plasma EPA, DPA, and total omega-3 significantly more than did EPA-EE. EPA+DPA-FFA also reduced triglycerides and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein without increasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

125,2021,35107763,Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia? ,omega-3 fatty acids hypertriglyceridemia,1.0,"Purpose of review: Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is widely prevalent in youth. There is an unmet need for effective medications in the management of HTG in youth. The purpose of this review is to summarize the approach to HTG in acute and chronic settings, and highlight emerging therapies targeted at specific genes, proteins, and enzymes to selectively alter triglyceride (TG) metabolism. Recent findings: Genetic and lifestyle factors play a significant role in the pathophysiology of HTG. Severe elevation of TG poses a risk of acute pancreatitis, while mild-to-moderate HTG increases the risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and, increasingly, has been linked with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Although a variety of therapeutic agents are in development, strict adherence to a heart healthy lifestyle, including dietary changes, remain the cornerstone of management for youth with HTG. In addition to lifestyle changes, pharmacological interventions, including fibrates, omega 3 fatty acids, and statins may be considered for management of moderate-to-severe HTG. In view of its association with premature cardiovascular disease (CVD), non-high-density-lipoprotein-C (non-HDL-C) is an important target for therapy in children with moderate HTG. Management of HTG is dependent on its etiology, concomitant symptoms, and degree of TG elevation. The last two decades have seen remarkable changes in drug development, specifically those that act through the lipoprotein lipase complex, including new targeted treatments such as inhibitors of apolipoprotein C3 and angiopoietin-like protein 3."

Objective: To determine the phase 3 efficacy and safety of a naturally derived krill oil with eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid as both phospholipid esters (PLs) and free fatty acids (FFAs) (ω-3-PL/FFA [CaPre]), measured by fasting TG levels and other lipid parameters in severe hypertriglyceridemia. Design, setting, and participants: This study pooled the results of 2 identical randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. TRILOGY 1 (Study of CaPre in Lowering Very High Triglycerides) enrolled participants at 71 US centers from January 23, 2018, to November 20, 2019; TRILOGY 2 enrolled participants at 93 US, Canadian, and Mexican centers from April 6, 2018, to January 9, 2020. Patients with fasting TG levels from 500 to 1500 mg/dL, with or without stable treatment with statins, fibrates, or other agents to lower cholesterol levels, were eligible to participate. Interventions: Randomization (2.5:1.0) to ω-3-PL/FFA, 4 g/d, vs placebo (cornstarch) for 26 weeks. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the mean percentage of change in TG levels at 12 weeks; persistence at 26 weeks was the key secondary outcome. Other prespecified secondary outcomes were effects on levels of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), HDL-C, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); safety and tolerability; and TG level changes in prespecified subgroups. Results: A total of 520 patients were randomized, with a mean (SD) age of 54.9 (11.2) years (339 men [65.2%]), mean (SD) body mass index of 31.5 (5.1), and baseline mean (SD) TG level of 701 (222) mg/dL. Two hundred fifty-six patients (49.2%) were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity; 275 (52.9%) had diabetes; and 248 (47.7%) were receiving statins. In the intention-to-treat analysis, TG levels were reduced by 26.0% (95% CI, 20.5%-31.5%) in the ω-3-PL/FFA group and 15.1% (95% CI, 6.6%-23.5%) in the placebo group at 12 weeks (mean treatment difference, -10.9% [95% CI, -20.4% to -1.5%]; P = .02), with reductions persisting at 26 weeks (mean treatment difference, -12.7% [95% CI, -23.1% to -2.4%]; P = .02). Compared with placebo, ω-3-PL/FFA had no significant effect at 12 weeks on mean treatment differences for non-HDL-C (-3.2% [95% CI, -8.0% to 1.6%]; P = .18), VLDL-C (-3.8% [95% CI, -12.2% to 4.7%]; P = .38), HDL-C (0.7% [95% CI, -3.7% to 5.1%]; P = .77), or LDL-C (4.5% [95% CI, -5.9% to 14.8%]; P = .40) levels; corresponding differences at 26 weeks were -5.8% (95% CI, -11.3% to -0.3%; P = .04) for non-HDL-C levels, -9.1% (95% CI, -21.5% to 3.2%; P = .15) for VLDL-C levels, 1.9% (95% CI, -4.8% to 8.6%; P = .57) for HDL-C levels, and 6.3% (95% CI, -12.4% to 25.0%; P = .51) for LDL-C levels. Effects on the primary end point did not vary significantly by age, sex, race and ethnicity, country, qualifying TG level, diabetes, or fibrate use but tended to be larger among patients taking statins or cholesterol absorption inhibitors at baseline (mean treatment difference, -19.5% [95% CI, -34.5% to -4.6%]; P = .08 for interaction) and with lower (less than median) baseline blood eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid levels (-19.5% [95% CI, -33.8% to -5.3%]; P = .08 for interaction). ω-3-PL/FFA was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo.

It is projected to become the leading cause of cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation in the United States. Guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) do not recommend routine screening of patients at high risk of NAFLD. European guidelines recommend testing for certain high-risk patients. Hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are difficult to diagnose and often go unrecognized until patients have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Noninvasive methods are used to assess fibrosis, such as fibrosis scores and vibration-controlled transient elastography. Liver biopsy remains the reference standard for NASH diagnosis and fibrosis staging. The mainstays of treatment for NAFLD, NASH, and fibrosis are weight loss and a healthy diet. Currently, no drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for management of these conditions. Drugs for diabetes management (eg, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, pioglitazone) can be useful in patients with diabetes and NASH. Among patients with NAFLD, cardiovascular disease is a common cause of mortality. Thus, the AASLD guidelines recommend consideration of omega-3 fatty acids for hypertriglyceridemia management in patients with NAFLD, and statins for hyperlipidemia management in most patients with NAFLD and NASH."

Methods: In REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial), a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, statin-treated patients with controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia were randomized to 4 g daily of icosapent ethyl or placebo. They experienced a 25% reduction in risk of a primary efficacy end point (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina) and a 26% reduction in risk of a key secondary efficacy end point (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) when compared with placebo. The current analysis reports on the subgroup of patients from the trial with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting. Results: Of the 8179 patients randomized in REDUCE-IT, a total of 1837 (22.5%) had a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, with 897 patients randomized to icosapent ethyl and 940 to placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Randomization to icosapent ethyl was associated with a significant reduction in the primary end point (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.63-0.92]; P =0.004), in the key secondary end point (HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.56-0.87]; P =0.001), and in total (first plus subsequent or recurrent) ischemic events (rate ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.50-0.81]; P =0.0002) compared with placebo. This yielded an absolute risk reduction of 6.2% (95% CI, 2.3%-10.2%) in first events, with a number needed to treat of 16 (95% CI, 10-44) during a median follow-up time of 4.8 years. Safety findings were similar to the overall study: beyond an increased rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter requiring hospitalization for at least 24 hours (5.0% vs 3.1%; P =0.03) and a nonsignificant increase in bleeding, occurrences of adverse events were comparable between groups.

They have systemic effects on the human organism. However, the diversity of the composition of probiotic complexes complicates the determination of the beneficial effects of specific microorganisms on the human body. These circumstances call for more research. Investigation of the effect of probiotic intake on the levels of various cytokines may explain the mechanisms of the beneficial effect of probiotic intake on the functioning of the immune system. Objective - to study the effectiveness of the probiotic Bifiform Kids for the prevention of respiratory infections in children with recurrent respiratory infections with gastrointestinal allergy symptoms. Material and methods . The prospective randomized controlled trial included 92 children aged from 4 to 5 years who suffers from more than 5 episodes of respiratory infections per year with gastrointestinal allergy symptoms. Patients from the main group (n=46) were prescribed 2 chewable tablets Bifiform Kids (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG not less than 1×109 CFU, Bifidobacterium animalis spp. lactis not less than 1×109 CFU, thiamine mononitrate 0.40 mg, pyridoxine hydrochloride 0.50 mg in each) twice per day within 21 days. Patients from the control group (n=46) were prescribed no probiotics during the study period. The study included the measurement of blood serum levels of immunoglobulins A, M, G (by immunoturbodimetry) and E, as well as the concentration of cytokines IL-17, IL-10 (by enzyme immunoassay). Measurements were performed at the 1st day of the study, at the 21st day of the study, and 6 months after the study initiation. The microbiota composition was determined by sequencing the bacterial 16S rRNA genes in DNA preparations isolated from stool samples collected at the start of the study and after 21 days. The Shannon index was calculated for the species of detected bacteria to determine the diversity of the microbiome. The effectiveness of disease prevention was measured by calculating the prevention index and the efficiency coefficient based on the incidence of respiratory infections in both groups during the observation period (6 months). Results . In the main group, the volume of the commensal flora decreased 3 weeks after the study initiation: Enterobacter from 18.3±19.3 to 10.5±18.1%; Enterococcus from 8.7±16.1 to 3.1±10.0%; Clostridium from 3.1±8.1 to 0.5±2.2%. There was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of representatives of the genus Bifidobacterium by 2.2 times (from 16.9±26.4 to 36.5±31.5%, p=0.0017) and a decrease in the Shannon index from 1.1±2.1 up to 0.4±1.1 (p 0.05). In the control group, there were no statistically significant changes in the microbiota content. In the main group, after 21 days, the blood IL-10 level increased from 11.3±15.4 to 15.7±13.4 pg/ml, and the IL-17 concentration decreased from 8.9±7.7 to 6.5±7.1 pg/ml (p= 0.05) while maintaining this trend by the 6th month of observation. There were no changes in these indicators in children from the control group. The main group demonstrated a significant (р= 0.05) decrease in the level of IgE from 184±121 to 104±67 and 114±54 kU/l, and a significant increase in IgA from 0.73±0.45 to 1.33±0.65 and 1.21±0.57 g/l after 3 weeks and at the end of the probiotic intake, respectively. The level of IgA in the main group remained higher during the study compared to the control group. The main group demonstrated a 3-fold decrease in the incidence of respiratory infections in comparison with the control group. The efficiency index was 3.21, the therapeutic response was 69%.

126,2021,36001877,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,"Background: Probiotics are live micro-organisms that may give a beneficial physiological effect when administered in adequate amounts. Some trials show that probiotic strains can prevent respiratory infections. Even though our previously published review showed the benefits of probiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), several new studies have been published. This is an update of a review first published in 2011 and updated in 2015. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose), compared with placebo or no treatment, in the prevention of acute URTIs in people of all ages, at risk of acute URTIs. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2022, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to May week 2, 2022), Embase (1974 to 10 May 2022), Web of Science (1900 to 10 May 2022), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, which includes the China Biological Medicine Database (from 1978 to 10 May 2022), the Chinese Medicine Popular Science Literature Database (from 2000 to 10 May 2022), and the Master's Degree Dissertation of Beijing Union Medical College Database (from 1981 to 10 May 2022). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for completed and ongoing trials on 10 May 2022. Selection criteria: We included individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs comparing probiotics with placebo or no treatment to prevent acute URTIs. The participants were children, adults, or the elderly in the community, care facilities, schools, or hospitals. Our main outcomes were the number of participants diagnosed with URTIs (at least one event and at least three events), the incidence rate (number of cases/person year) of acute URTIs, and the mean duration of an episode of URTIs. Our secondary outcomes were the number of participants who were absent from childcare centre, school, or work due to acute URTIs; the number of participants who used prescribed antibiotics for acute URTIs; and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event from probiotics. We excluded studies if they did not specify acute respiratory infections as 'upper'; studies with more than 50% of participants vaccinated against influenza or other acute URTIs within the last 12 months; and studies with significantly different proportions of vaccinated participants between the probiotics arm and the placebo or no treatment arm. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials and extracted data using standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We analysed both intention-to-treat and per-protocol data and used a random-effects model. We expressed results as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included 23 individual RCTs and one cluster-RCT. As one of the individual RCTs did not report outcomes in a usable way, we could only meta-analyse data from 23 trials, involving a total of 6950 participants including children (aged from one month to 11 years old), adults (mean age 37.3), and older people (mean age 84.6 years). One trial reported 22.5% flu-vaccine participants within the last 12 months, and 25.4% flu-vaccine participants during the intervention. Probiotics were more likely to be given with milk-based food in children; administered in powder form in adults; and given with milk-based food or in capsules in the elderly. Most of the studies used one or two strains (e.g. Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL9, Lactobacillus paracasei (8700:2 or N1115)) and 10<sup>9</sup> or 10<sup>11</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/day of probiotics for more than three months. We found that probiotics may reduce the number of participants diagnosed with URTIs (at least one event) (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87; P 0.001; 16 studies, 4798 participants; low-certainty evidence); likely reduce the number of participants diagnosed with URTIs (at least three events) (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.91; P = 0.02; 4 studies, 763 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); may reduce the incidence rate (number of cases/person year) of URTIs (rate ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92, P = 0.001; 12 studies, 4364 participants; low-certainty evidence); may reduce the mean duration of an episode of acute URTIs (MD -1.22 days, 95% CI -2.12 to -0.33; P = 0.007; 6 studies, 2406 participants; low-certainty evidence); likely reduce the number of participants who used prescribed antibiotics for acute URTIs (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.81; P = 0.001; 6 studies, 1548 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and may not increase the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.15; P = 0.79; 8 studies, 2456 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence showing a decrease in the number of people absent from childcare centre, school, or work due to acute URTIs with probiotics is very uncertain (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.59; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events from probiotics were minor, and most commonly gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea, and bowel pain. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that probiotics were better than placebo or no treatment in preventing acute URTIs."
126,2021,35462444,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,"Respiratory diseases are responsible for a greater mortality rate around the world. Viral or bacterial infections in the respiratory tract have been identified as major causative agents for death and disability among the population. Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) cause severe respiratory ailments starting from coldlike symptoms, eventually affecting the lungs and other viscera, and are mainly categorized into two types depending on the affected area: upper RTIs and lower RTIs. Respiratory viruses belong to several viral families such as influenza virus, enterovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and recently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Studies have indicated that people with good immune functions are less prone to respiratory infections and also their recovery rate is quicker. Innate and acquired immune systems actively participate in the recognition and elimination of the pathogenic agents. In the present context, the potential of probiotics is recognized as viable microorganisms that support the balance of the beneficial microbial population in the gastrointestinal tract and promote host immunity. The probiotics have long been known to regulate bodily immune functions and have been used against general RTIs such as cough, pharyngitis, laryngitis, pneumonia, and asthma. In addition, intervention with probiotics could directly affect the composition of the gut microbiota that have been shown to palliate respiratory diseases by modulating pulmonary immune activities through the gut-lung axis, and therefore, probiotics could become an alternative therapeutic approach for RTIs."
126,2021,35274866,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) have long been among the most common diseases. In the structure of the general infectious morbidity, UTIs rank second after acute respiratory viral infection. Every year, researchers note an increasing number of mutations in the genomes of bacteria that cause infectious diseases, which leads to the formation of more and more aggressive forms of pathogens. Patients with infectious diseases of the urinary system have the highest risk of biofilm formation, the frequency of which is directly proportional to the length of time the urethral catheter is located and accounts for more than half of all nosocomial infections. The presence of resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria and the development of bacterial biofilms are major problems in the treatment of urinary tract infections. The increasing number of nosocomial bacterial strains in the hospital increases the postoperative bed-day, the frequency of readmission and the number of antibacterial drugs used. In light of increasing antibacterial resistance, the use of medical resources is dramatically increasing, which ultimately leads to an increase in the cost of treatment. Along with this, the selection of resistant strains brings to the fore both the rational use of antibacterial drugs and the search for alternative methods of therapy. This review of publications on the problem of bacterial biofilm formation in urological practice demonstrates updated information on the role of enzymes, probiotics, and bacteriophages in preventing biofilm formation on various medical biomaterials, such as urethral catheters."

Nevertheless, the findings of studies are contradictory. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the influence of PRO-formula on RTIs in infants by pooling randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: To obtain eligible RCTs, Scopus and PubMed databases were systematically searched from their inception to November 2020. A random-effects model was applied to pool the relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for RTIs following consumption of PRO-formula. Results: A total of 15 RCTs, with a total sample size of 3805 participants (1957 for intervention and 1848 for placebo), were included in the present meta-analysis. In the overall analysis, in comparison to placebo, consumption of PRO-formula had a significant protective impact against RTIs (RR = 0.89, 95%CI: 0.82-0.97) in infants, with a remarkable evidence of heterogeneity across studies (I2 = 61.4%, P 0.001). In the meta-regression analysis, the effect of PRO-formula on RTIs was not modified by the follow-up duration. No evidence for publication bias was detected. Conclusions: Administration of PRO-formula may be a potential approach for the prevention of respiratory tract infections in infants."
126,2021,34690010,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,"Over the period, viral infections remain the utmost challenge in front of the scientific community. Continuous shifting and drafting of viral antigenic peptides are the main drivers in the development of antiviral drug resistance. The resurgence of disease, difficulties facing the development of an effective vaccine and undesirable immunological outcomes, foster to develop an alternative therapeutic approach to combat viral infections. Biomimetic nature of viral particles competent to invade the host cell by downregulating the expression of immune responsive cells. To revive from such complications, strengthening the innate immunity places first and foremost defense mechanisms to restrict viral infiltration. Variegated probiotic strains show antiviral activity by stimulating the macrophage and dendritic cell to secret the inflammation response mediated chemokines and cytokines, production of antimicrobial peptides, and biosurfactants, modulate the antiviral gens expression, alter the proportional functionality of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory cells (Tregs), etc. With the appreciation for the antiviral activity and health benefits, however, the selectivity of specific probiotic strain from the diversified microbiome, the interactive molecular mechanism of probiotics, viability and sustainability of a specific number of a probiotic strain at the end of the shelf life, stability, selection of the formulation materials, identification and validation of the key process parameters have the major challenges for the development of an effective probiotic therapy against viral infections."

However, the results of studies are inconclusive. We aimed to systematically investigate the effect of PFDP on RTIs by performing a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: PubMed and Scopus databases were systematically searched up to October 2020 to identify eligible RCTs. Meta-analysis outcomes were risk of incidence of upper (URTIs ) and lower (LRTIs ) respiratory tract infections. A random-effects model was used to pool the relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for outcomes following conception of PFDP. Results: A total of 22 RCTs, with a total sample size of 10,190 participants, were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, consumption of PFDP had a significant protective effect against RTIs in the overall analysis (RR = 0.81, 95 %CI: 0.74 to 0.89) and in children (RR = 0.82, 95 %CI: 0.73 to 0.93), adults (RR = 0.81, 95 %CI: 0.66 to 1.00), and elderly population (RR = 0.78, 95 %CI: 0.61 to 0.98). The significant decreased risk of RTIs was also observed for URTIs (RR = 0.83, 95 %CI: 0.73 to 0.93), while, this effect was marginal for LRTIs (RR = 0.78, 95 %CI: 0.60 to 1.01, P = 0.06). The disease-specific analysis showed that PFDP have a protective effect on pneumonia (RR = 0.76, 95 %CI: 0.61 to 0.95) and common cold (RR = 0.68, 95 %CI: 0.49 to 0.96). Conclusions: Consumption of PFDP is a potential dietary approach for the prevention of RTIs."
126,2021,33896042,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,"The immunopathology of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection varies considerably, severe disease occurring only in a minority of the affected children. The variability of the clinical presentation is in part explained by viral and environmental factors but, in infants and young children, disease severity is certainly linked to the physiologic immaturity of the innate and adaptive immune system. There is evidence that the maturation of the host immune response is positively influenced by the composition of the nasopharyngeal microbiome that, promoting an efficient reaction, can counteract the predisposition to develop viral respiratory infections and lower the risk of disease severity. However, interaction between the nasopharyngeal microbiota and respiratory viruses can be bidirectional since microbial dysbiosis may also represent a reflection of the disease-induced alterations of the local milieu. Moreover, viruses like RSV can also increase the virulence of potential pathogens in nasopharynx, a main reservoir of bacteria, and therefore promote their spread to the lower airways causing superinfection. Moreover, if negative changes in microbial community composition in early life may constitute a heightened risk toward severe RSV respiratory infection, on the contrary specific groups of microorganisms seem to be associated with protection. A better understanding into the potential negative and positive role of the different nasopharyngeal bacterial species on RSV infection may improve primary prevention and possibly care of this highly contagious disorder."
126,2021,33874878,Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,probiotics prevention respiratory infections,1.0,"Background: Viral respiratory infections could result in perturbation of the gut microbiota due to a probable cross-talk between lungs and gut microbiota. This can affect pulmonary health and the gastrointestinal system. Objective: This review aimed to discuss the impact of probiotics/prebiotics and supplements on the prevention and treatment of respiratory infections, especially emerging pathogens. Methods: The data were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Google Patents, and The Lens-Patent using keywords of probiotics and viral respiratory infections in the title, abstract, and keywords. Results: Probiotics consumption could decrease the susceptibility to viral respiratory infections, such as COVID-19 and simultaneously enhance vaccine efficiency in infectious disease prevention through the immune system enhancement. Probiotics improve the gut microbiota and the immune system via regulating the innate system response and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, treatment with probiotics contributes to intestinal homeostasis restitution under antibiotic pressure and decreasing the risk of secondary infections due to viral respiratory infections. Probiotics present varied performances in different conditions; thus, promoting their efficacy through combining with supplements (prebiotics, postbiotics, nutraceuticals, berberine, curcumin, lactoferrin, minerals, and vitamins) is important. Several supplements reported to enhance the probiotics' efficacy and their mechanisms as well as probiotics- related patents are summarized in this review. Using nanotechnology and microencapsulation techniques can also improve probiotics' efficiency. Conclusion: Given the global challenge of COVID-19, probiotic/prebiotic and following nutritional guidelines should be regarded seriously. Additionally, their role as an adjuvant in vaccination for immune response augmentation needs attention."

We investigate the benefits of the AromaTouch Hand Technique<sup>®</sup> (ATHT), a procedure that combines a moderate pressure touch with the application of essential oils to the hand, in individuals with hand arthritis. Methods and materials: Thirty-six participants with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and/or chronic inflammation received ATHTs with either a 50/50 preparation of Deep Blue<sup>®</sup> and Copaiba oil or a coconut oil placebo twice daily for 5 consecutive days. Changes in maximum flexion in finger and thumb joints, items from the Arthritis Hand Function Test, and hand pain scores were evaluated. Results: Participants treated with the essential oil preparation required significantly less time to complete dexterity tasks and showed about 50% decrease in pain scores, increased finger strength, and significantly increased angle of maximum flexion compared to subjects treated with coconut oil.

Limited data suggest that aromatherapy massage and reflexology may help to reduce pain and fatigue in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study was to examine and compare the effects of aromatherapy massage and reflexology on pain and fatigue in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The study sample was randomly assigned to either an aromatherapy massage (n = 17), reflexology (n = 17) or the control group (n = 17). Aromatherapy massage was applied to both knees of subjects in the first intervention group for 30 minutes. Reflexology was administered to both feet of subjects in the second intervention group for 40 minutes during weekly home visits. Control group subjects received no intervention. Fifty-one subjects with rheumatoid arthritis were recruited from a university hospital rheumatology clinic in Turkey between July 2014 and January 2015 for this randomized controlled trial. Data were collected by personal information form, DAS28 index, Visual Analog Scale and Fatigue Severity Scale. Pain and fatigue scores were measured at baseline and within an hour after each intervention for 6 weeks. Pain and fatigue scores significantly decreased in the aromatherapy massage and reflexology groups compared with the control group (p .05). The reflexology intervention started to decrease mean pain and fatigue scores earlier than aromatherapy massage (week 1 vs week 2 for pain, week 1 vs week 4 for fatigue) (p .05). Aromatherapy massage and reflexology are simple and effective nonpharmacologic nursing interventions that can be used to help manage pain and fatigue in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."
127,2021,17042021,Can aromatherapy massage help manage rheumatoid arthritis?,aromatherapy massage rheumatoid arthritis,1.0,"Objectives: (1) to develop an understanding as to how the use of complementary therapy (CT) affects a patient's perspective of health and well-being, (2) to offer the rheumatology professional insight and understanding as to why a patient chooses to use a CT, and (3) to raise awareness as to the forms of CT most commonly used by patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: This qualitative study was based on phenomenological principles applied through focused inquiry to develop an understanding of the lived experience of the study participants. The inclusion criteria of an established diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and known use of CT were applied to a convenience sample of patients attending a rheumatology outpatient department clinic on two consecutive days. Of the 15 eligible patients identified, five were randomly selected for inclusion in the study. Narrative data were collected through analysis of transcripts taken from audiotape recordings of unstructured interviews with study participants. A manual indexing system was used to develop four significant categorisation themes to reflect the findings: (1) incentives to use CT, (2) perceived benefits of CT use, (3) the choice of CT used, and (4) perceived disadvantages and risks of CT use. Results: Incentives to use CT included dissatisfaction with conventional treatment, often in the form of side effects, and drug ineffectiveness. Social factors, such as loss of employment and social activities, were also indicated, as were psychological changes in the form of depression, hopelessness and fear. Perceived benefits were categorised as either physical or psychological with associated aspects of choice and control viewed as important elements of personal empowerment. The choice of CT used fell into three categories; physical, spiritual and herbal. The most commonly used of these were herbal remedies and supplements, closely followed by aromatherapy massage. Disadvantages and risks were identified as physical (pain and discomfort), psychological (fear and uncertainty), and/or material (cost). Conclusions: This study suggests that regular use of CT by patients with rheumatoid arthritis offers holistic benefits. Compared to conventional treatments, CT is seen to have advantages in terms of a lower incidence of adverse reactions, greater patient choice, psychological comfort and an increased quality of the patient/therapist relationship. The use of CT by patients with rheumatoid arthritis indicates a need for evidence-based information about its use and safety in order to direct practice within a rheumatology department."

129,2021,27050695,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,"Androgenic alopecia (AGA) is the most common type of hair loss in men, characterized by hair miniaturization, hairline recession, and vertex balding. It affects approximately 50% of men, negatively affecting self-esteem and sociability. Topical minoxidil formulations are approved up to a 5% concentration for men, but patient adherence to treatment is challenged by gradual results that may be perceived as a lack of initial benefit. Herbal extracts, which are also believed to promote healthier-looking hair, have a long history of use in hair care formulations. The safety and efficacy of a twice-daily regimen of 5% minoxidil foam used in combination with a novel botanical hair solution was evaluated in a 12-week, multicenter, single-arm, open label study in 56 subjects with mild to moderate AGA. Assessments included investigator ratings of improvement and subject self-ratings of satisfaction. Investigator ratings indicated significant improvement in scalp hair coverage and perception of overall treatment benefit in as early as 4 weeks (P .001). Subject self-ratings were significant for improved hair growth and hair appearance in as few as 4 weeks (P .05). The regimen was well tolerated, and subjects indicated a high degree of satisfaction. Investigator and subject-assessed efficacy and subject satisfaction with this novel regimen provide clinicians with an effective treatment option for AGA that also provides a high level of patient satisfaction, which may help promote patient adherence to long-term treatment."
129,2021,23104985,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,"Balding causes widespread psychological distress but is poorly controlled. The commonest treatment, minoxidil, was originally an antihypertensive drug that promoted unwanted hair. We hypothesized that another serendipitous discovery, increased eyelash growth side-effects of prostamide F(2α)-related eyedrops for glaucoma, may be relevant for scalp alopecias. Eyelash hairs and follicles are highly specialized and remain unaffected by androgens that inhibit scalp follicles and stimulate many others. Therefore, we investigated whether non-eyelash follicles could respond to bimatoprost, a prostamide F(2α) analog recently licensed for eyelash hypotrichosis. Bimatoprost, at pharmacologically selective concentrations, increased hair synthesis in scalp follicle organ culture and advanced mouse pelage hair regrowth in vivo compared to vehicle alone. A prostamide receptor antagonist blocked isolated follicle growth, confirming a direct, receptor-mediated mechanism within follicles; RT-PCR analysis identified 3 relevant receptor genes in scalp follicles in vivo. Receptors were located in the key follicle regulator, the dermal papilla, by analyzing individual follicular structures and immunohistochemistry. Thus, bimatoprost stimulates human scalp follicles in culture and rodent pelage follicles in vivo, mirroring eyelash behavior, and scalp follicles contain bimatoprost-sensitive prostamide receptors in vivo. This highlights a new follicular signaling system and confirms that bimatoprost offers a novel, low-risk therapeutic approach for scalp alopecias."

The treatment standard in dermatology clinics continues to be minoxidil and finasteride with hair transplantation as a surgical option. Here we briefly review current therapeutic options and treatments under active investigation. Dutasteride and ketoconazole are also employed for AGA, while prostaglandin analogues latanoprost and bimatoprost are being investigated for their hair growth promoting potential. Laser treatment products available for home use and from cosmetic clinics are becoming popular. In the future, new cell mediated treatment approaches may be available for AGA. While there are a number of potential treatment options, good clinical trial data proving hair growth efficacy is limited."
129,2021,18258787,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,"Hair disorders cause psychological distress but are generally poorly controlled; more effective treatments are required. Despite the long-standing use of minoxidil for balding, its mechanism is unclear; suggestions include action on vasculature or follicle cells. Similar drugs also stimulate hair, implicating ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels. To investigate whether K(ATP) channels are present in human follicles, we used organ culture, molecular biological, and immunohistological approaches. Minoxidil and tolbutamide, a K(ATP) channel blocker, opposed each other's effects on the growing phase (anagen) of scalp follicles cultured in media with and without insulin. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction identified K(ATP) channel component gene expression including regulatory sulfonylurea receptors (SUR) SUR1 and SUR2B but not SUR2A and pore-forming subunits (Kir) Kir6.1 and Kir6.2. When hair bulb tissues were examined separately, epithelial matrix expressed SUR1 and Kir6.2, whereas both dermal papilla and sheath exhibited SUR2B and Kir6.1. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated similar protein distributions. Thus, human follicles respond biologically to K(ATP) channel regulators in culture and express genes and proteins for two K(ATP) channels, Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.1/SUR2B; minoxidil only stimulates SUR2 channels. These findings indicate that human follicular dermal papillae contain K(ATP) channels that can respond to minoxidil and that tolbutamide may suppress hair growth clinically; novel drugs designed specifically for these channels could treat hair disorders."
129,2021,15983438,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,"The treatment of androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is usually long lasting, and the effects of treatment attempts are difficult to measure. Consequently, there was a need for a sensitive tool to monitor hair loss and treatment response. Therefore, we developed the Trichoscan as a method which combines epiluminescence microscopy with automatic digital image analysis for the measurement of human hair. The Trichoscan is able to analyze all important parameters of hair growth (density, diameter, growth rate, vellus and terminal hair density) with an intraclass correlation of approximately 91% within the same Trichoscan operator and an intraclass correlation of approximately 97% for different Trichoscan operators. The application of the technique was demonstrated by comparison of the hair parameters in 9 men with frontal balding which were treated for 6 months with 5% minoxidil. Even in this small cohort of patients, we noticed after 3 months of treatment compared to baseline a significant increase in hair density (+21.3 hairs/cm2; p = 0.047) and cumulative hair thickness (+0.61 mm; p = 0.008) and after 6 months a significant increase in hair density (+34 hairs/cm2; p = 0.011) and cumulative hair thickness (+0.88 mm; p = 0.010). The study shows that the Trichoscan has many advantages. It can be used for clinical studies to compare placebo versus treatment or to compare the relative potencies of different hair-growth-promoting substances. It can be used for studying AGA or other forms of diffuse hair loss, and it can be adopted to study the effect of drugs or laser treatment on hypertrichosis or hirsutism. The drawbacks, however, are that the Trichoscan still needs a hair dye for contrast enhancement and the measurement area must be clipped before analysis. This mini-review summarizes recent attempts to optimize the technique and shows new options such as the calculation of follicular units or the 'anagen hair count'."
129,2021,15651368,Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,minoxidil balding hair growth,1.0,"Hair follicles are composed primarily of epithelial and dermal components that develop from embryonic ectoderm and mesoderm respectively. The hair growth cycle is coordinated with complex processes that are dependent on the interactions of epithelial and dermal components. Beard and frontal scalp dermal papilla cells (DPCs) show the characteristics of androgen target cells. These DPCs expressed androgen receptor and type II 5alpha-reductase mRNA. To understand the mode of androgen action in human hair follicles, we developed an in vitro co-culture system using DPCs and follicular keratinocytes. Androgen significantly stimulated the proliferation of keratinocytes co-cultured with beard DPCs, suggesting that these DPCs produce androgen-dependent diffusible growth factors. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) was identified as one of the androgen dependent paracrine growth factors from beard DPCs. On the other hand, we identified inhibitory roles of androgen on the growth of keratinocytes co-cultured with DPCs from human balding frontal scalp, when DPCs were transfected with the AR expression vector. This inhibitory effect was mediated by TGF-beta1 from the DPCs. Minoxidil and Finasteride were recently introduced for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in Japan, and TGF-beta1 is the next target for innovative treatment."

Associated diseases include psychologic disorders and coronary heart disease. Hair growth is unpredictable and limited for all pharmacologic therapies, with the vast majority of treatment studies being industry sponsored. Conclusion: AGA is not easy to treat.

We studied the effect of minoxidil on testosterone metabolism by cultured dermal papilla cells from balding or nonbalding scalp and dermal fibroblasts. In all three groups, 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity was much higher than 5alpha-reductase activity. Minoxidil increased 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity by nearly 40% (P 0.001) in dermal papilla cells of balding scalp, whereas the effect was less marked in dermal papilla cells from nonbalding scalp and dermal fibroblasts. 5alpha-Reductase activity was also slightly increased by minoxidil in dermal papilla cells from balding scalp. Again, the effect on 5alpha-reductase activity was insignificant in the other two groups of cells. Whether such modification of testosterone metabolism in dermal papilla cells of balding scalp by minoxidil is related to its therapeutic effect remains unknown."

Correlative studies demonstrate that a series of PCOs including minoxidil, pinacidil, P-1075, an active pinacidil analog, RP-49,356, cromakalim, and nicorandil maintain hair growth in cultured vibrissa follicles. Studies using balding stumptail macaques verify that minoxidil, P-1075, and cromakalim but not RP-49,356 stimulate hair growth. The definition of potassium channels and documentation of drug effects on these channels is classically done using electrophysiologic techniques. Such studies require the identification and isolation of target cells. Both these are among the unsolved problems in the area of hair biology. Estimating K+ flux using 86Rb+ as a K+ tracer is an accepted method of assessing potassium channel conductance in other organ systems. Both pinacidil and RP-49,356 induce measurable Rb+ flux in isolated vibrissa follicles and a hair epithelial cell line whereas neither minoxidil nor minoxidil sulfate had measurable effects. Potassium channels have been studied successfully in other organ systems using specific pharmacologic blockers for the various channel subtypes. Blockers including glyburide, tetraethylammonium, and procaine failed to inhibit minoxidil stimulation of cultured follicles. The current explosion of knowledge on potassium channel biology, cloning of channels, and continued progress in hair biology promise to clarify the role of K+ ions in the control of hair follicles."

There are approximately 2 dozen such clinics in Tijuana, some of which have been treating international cancer patients since 1963. Among the first clinics to be established were the Bio-Medical Center (Hoxsey therapy), Oasis of Hope (a Laetrile-oriented clinic), and a series of clinics affiliated with the Gerson diet therapy. These original clinics were established mainly by American citizens in response to increased regulation of nonstandard therapies in the United States, particularly after passage of the Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act in 1962. In the 1970s, the Tijuana clinics proliferated with the upsurge of interest in Laetrile (amygdalin). By 1978, 70,000 US cancer patients had taken Laetrile for cancer treatment, and many of those had gone to Tijuana to receive it. The popularity of the Tijuana clinics peaked in the mid-1980s. Although many new clinics opened after then, a dozen have folded in the past 10 years alone. The turning point for the clinics came with passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which facilitated greater cooperation among the antifraud authorities of Canada, the United States, and Mexico. In 1994, the tripartite members of NAFTA formed the Mexico-United States-Canada Health Fraud Work Group, or MUCH, whose brief is to strengthen the 3 countries' ability to prevent cross-border health fraud. Under the auspices of MUCH and its members, regulatory crackdowns began in earnest early in 2001. The clinics were also badly affected by the general downturn in travel after 9/11. If these trends continue, many Tijuana clinics are unlikely to survive. Some suggestions are made for how the Tijuana clinics could be reorganized and reformed to minimize the likelihood of governmental actions and to maximize public support. Such reforms center on 5 main areas: (1) research, (2) physical plant, (3) finances, (4) ethics, and (5) education."

Participants: 34 children (30 boys and 4 girls) aged between 4 and 17 years affected by Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder, associated with anxiety symptoms. Results: Patients in both groups showed a reduction in the severity of tic and anxiety symptoms. Supplementation with L-Theanine and vitamin B6 was significantly more effective than psychoeducation in reducing tics and co-occurring disorders, as measured by neuropsychological findings. Conclusions: Supplementation of both L-Theanine and Vitamin B6 may help in the treatment of tic disorders associated with anxious symptoms. Between-group differences in clinician-rated severity did reach statistical significance only for tics. Despite this finding, further placebo-controlled trials are needed."
131,2021,32448752,Can l-theanine supplements reduce stress and anxiety?,l-theanine supplements anxiety,1.0,"Background: Mood disorders, including depression and anxiety, are complex and multifactorial, impacting the quality of life for those suffering and making them difficult to manage for their providing health care providers. Diet, stress, medication, genetics, and the microbiome have been attributed to playing a role. Currently, prescription drugs are the first course of treatment despite the World Health Organization calling for a need to develop lifestyle interventions to manage these disorders. The use of single amino acids to impact selected neurotransmitters has demonstrated positive outcomes in the literature, however, the use of multiple amino acids, alongside personalized nutritional therapies is not well documented for mood disorders. This case report demonstrates the effective use of amino acids as an innovative therapy for the management of mood disorders. Case description: A 26-year-old Caucasian female presented with anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, carbohydrate cravings, and low energy. She had been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), bipolar depression II and generalized anxiety. The patient was under the care of a counselor and physician and was prescribed Lamictal (200 mg/day). With only moderate success with other therapies, the patient sought nutritional counseling. A personalized nutrition intervention was created to include targeted amino acid therapy (tryptophan, glycine, L-glutamine, D-phenylalanine, L-theanine, and L-tyrosine), select nutrients (multi vitamin/mineral, zinc, vitamin C, GLA and magnesium) and a low-glycemic diet to be followed for 12 weeks. Conclusion: This case report demonstrated the use of targeted micronutrient and amino acid therapy, along with a low glycemic diet, resulted in marked improvement in all mood disorder symptoms this patient experienced. It also highlights that a comprehensive integrative approach may be a beneficial option for individuals with mood disorders."
131,2021,31758301,Can l-theanine supplements reduce stress and anxiety?,l-theanine supplements anxiety,1.0,"The green tea amino acid, L-theanine (L-THE) is associated with several health benefits, including improvements in mood, cognition and a reduction of stress and anxiety-like symptoms. This systematic review evaluated the effect of pure L-THE intake, in the form of orally administered nutritional supplements, on stress responses and anxiety levels in human randomised controlled trials. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist, 9 peer-reviewed journal articles were identified where L-THE as a supplement was compared to a control. Our findings suggest that supplementation of 200-400 mg/day of L-THE may assist in the reduction of stress and anxiety in people exposed to stressful conditions. Despite this finding, longer-term and larger cohort clinical studies, including those where L-THE is incorporated into the diet regularly, are needed to clinically justify the use of L-THE as a therapeutic agent to reduce stress and anxiety in people exposed to stressful conditions."
132,2021,28849871,Does inhaling steam help treat common cold?,inhaling steam common cold,0.0,"Background: Heated, humidified air has long been used by people with the common cold. The theoretical basis is that steam may help congested mucus drain better and that heat may destroy the cold virus as it does in vitro. This is an update of a review last published in 2013. Objectives: To assess the effects of inhaling heated water vapour (steam) in the treatment of the common cold by comparing symptoms, viral shedding, and nasal resistance. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (to February 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to 24 February 2017), Embase (1990 to 24 February 2017), and Current Contents (1998 to 24 February 2017). We also searched World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (8 March 2017) and ClinicalTrials.gov (8 March 2017) as well as reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials using heated water vapour in participants with the common cold or experimentally induced common cold were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Three review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion of potential studies identified from the search. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram. We used a data collection form for study characteristics and outcome data that was developed and used for previous versions of this review. Two review authors independently extracted data, and a third review author resolved any disagreements. We used Review Manager 5 software to analyse data. Main results: We included six trials from five publications involving a total of 387 participants. We included no new studies in this 2017 update. The 'Risk of bias' assessment suggested an unclear risk of bias in the domain of randomisation and a low risk of bias in performance, detection, attrition, and reporting.It was uncertain whether heated, humidified air provides symptomatic relief for the common cold, as the fixed-effect analysis showed evidence of an effect (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.56; 2 studies, 149 participants), but the random-effects analysis showed no significant difference in the results (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.95). There is an argument for using either form of analysis. No studies demonstrated an exacerbation of clinical symptom scores. One study conducted in the USA demonstrated worsened nasal resistance, but an earlier Israeli study showed improvement. One study examined viral shedding in nasal washings, finding no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.19). As judged by the subjective response to therapy (i.e. therapy did not help), the number of participants reporting resolution of symptoms was not significantly higher in the heated humidified group (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.18; 2 studies, 124 participants). There was significant heterogeneity in the effects of heated, humidified air on different outcomes, therefore we graded the quality of the evidence as low. Some studies reported minor adverse events (including discomfort or irritation of the nose). Authors' conclusions: The current evidence does not show any benefits or harms from the use of heated, humidified air delivered via the RhinoTherm device for the treatment of the common cold. There is a need for more double-blind, randomised trials that include standardised treatment modalities."

Search strategy: In the initial review published in issue 3, 1999 of The Cochrane Library, we searched MEDLINE with MeSH headings: common cold, rhinopharyngitis, inhalation, steam, heated vapour, rhinothermy (January 1966 to July 1999). EMBASE, Current Contents, review articles, cross references were also searched. Attempts were also made to contact the manufacturers for any unpublished data. In this updated review, we have searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November Week 2, 2003), EMBASE (January 1990 to November 2003), and Current Contents (current five years). Selection criteria: Randomized trials using heated water vapour in a standardized way in patients with the common cold or volunteers with experimental induction of rhinovirus infection were included in the review. Data collection and analysis: All the articles retrieved were initially subjected to a review for inclusion / exclusion criteria. Review articles, editorials, abstracts with inadequate outcome description were excluded. Studies selected for inclusion were subjected to a methodological assessment. Main results: The results of a systematic review of six trials with 319 participants, support the use of warm vapour inhalations in the common cold in terms of relief of symptoms (Odds Ratio with 95 % CI 0.31, 0.16-0.60, Relative risk 0.56, 0.4-0.79). Results on symptom score indices were equivocal. None of the studies demonstrated a worsening of clinical symptom scores. One study demonstrated increased nasal resistance one week after steam inhalation in contrast to an earlier study which showed improvement in the nasal resistance. There was no evidence of decreased viral shedding measured by virus isolation in the nasal secretions (Tyrrell 1989a) or measurement of viral titres in nasal washings among treatment group. The rhinovirus titres in the nasal washings from the treatment group were the same as those of the placebo group on day one prior to the treatment and on all four days after the treatment. The area under curve (Hendley 1994) was also similar in the placebo and treatment groups for titres of virus in the nasal washings as were the average viral titres across five days of follow up, the maximum values after treatment, and viral shedding velocity i.e. amount of virus shed per day (Hendley 1994). Minor side effects due to thermal stress were reported in all the studies. Reviewers' conclusions: Three trials demonstrated beneficial effects on the symptoms of the common cold. One study from Israel showed a decrease in nasal resistance measured by peak nasal expiratory and inspiratory flow rate. Studies done in North America failed to show any objective improvement in outcome measures with the study intervention. A multi-centre double blind randomised controlled trial testing this therapy with uniform outcome measures is recommended."

Design: An in vitro study determined the temperature that inactivated rhinovirus: a temperature of 43 degrees C lasting at least 1 hour was needed. We then conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized in vivo study. Setting: The virology laboratory and the outpatient department of the Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic Foundation. Patients: Sixty-eight Cleveland Clinic employee volunteers with symptoms of the common cold at the time of enrollment. Intervention: A single 60-minute treatment was given to the volunteers. The steam treatment group (n = 32) received 40 L/min of heated saturated air that raised the intranasal temperature to 43 degrees C. The placebo group (n = 36) received 2 L/min of ambient air at 20 degrees C to 24 degrees C. Main outcome measures: Subjective symptom scores for nasal congestion, nasal drainage, and sneezing and objective measures of nasal resistance were studied during a 7-day follow-up observation period. Results: There were no significant differences in daily symptom scores between the groups (P = .59 to .83). The only statistically significant differences between the groups were lower nasal resistances at baseline in the steam group (P = .04) and percent improvement in nasal resistance favoring the placebo group on day 7 (P = .01). However, these differences were of questionable clinical significance. Conclusion: We conclude that steam inhalation treatment had no beneficial effect on the cold symptoms of our volunteers."

Objective: to identify the physiotherapeutic strategies used in the treatment of patients with LAM. Materials and methods: This is a systematic review of literature. Searches were performed (in PubMed, Lilacs, Embase and PEDro databases) with the keywords ""Lymphangioleiomyomatosis"" and ""Physiotherapy,"" and its variations. Articles describing physiotherapy interventions were included in the study. Data extracted from the studies were authors, year, country of publication, sample size, physiotherapy intervention, time/frequency/duration of intervention protocols, instruments used to measure results and main findings. Methodological quality of studies was evaluated by PEDro Scale (clinical trials), Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS; observational studies) and CARE checklist (case reports), respectively. Results: A total of 82 articles identified, three duplicates were removed, 71 studies were excluded after title and abstract reading and four after full-text reading, all due to absence of association with the study topic. Four studies were included in the present review. Cardiorespiratory physiotherapy with endurance and resistance training were identified as physiotherapeutic strategies to improve lung function, functional capacity, depression symptoms and quality of life in LAM. Conclusions: Endurance and resistance training is the keystone for physiotherapy in patients with LAM, but despite the reported benefits, there is a huge lack of studies related to the modalities, safety and dosage of physiotherapy prescription for patients with LAM.KEY MESSAGESLymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare disease, leads to progressive dyspnoea and exercise intolerance;Physiotherapy can improve dyspnoea and exercise intolerance in LAM through endurance and resistance exercises."
133,2021,36211340,Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,exercise depression,1.0,"Vitamin D exerts important extra-skeletal effects, exhibiting an exquisite immune regulatory ability, affecting both innate and adaptive immune responses through the modulation of immunocyte function and signaling. Remarkably, the immune function of working skeletal muscle, which is fully recognized to behave as a secretory organ with immune capacity, is under the tight control of vitamin D as well. Vitamin D status, meaning hormone sufficiency or insufficiency, can push toward strengthening/stabilization or decline of immune surveillance, with important consequences for health. This aspect is particularly relevant when considering the athletic population: while exercising is, nowadays, the recommended approach to maintain health and counteract inflammatory processes, ""too much"" exercise, often experienced by athletes, can increase inflammation, decrease immune surveillance, and expose them to a higher risk of diseases. When overexercise intersects with hypovitaminosis D, the overall effects on the immune system might converge into immune depression and higher vulnerability to diseases. This paper aims to provide an overview of how vitamin D shapes human immune responses, acting on the immune system and skeletal muscle cells; some aspects of exercise-related immune modifications are addressed, focusing on athletes. The crossroad where vitamin D and exercise meet can profile whole-body immune response and health."
133,2021,36203500,Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,exercise depression,1.0,"Recently, cognitive serious games have successfully been employed to train cognitive abilities in elderly people with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and related disorders. However, despite the continuous rehabilitation game design and its applications, the existing cognitive exercise games fall short of user interaction and personalized elements with regard to difficult levels, which leads to users leaving early and losing interests during the gameplay. In this regard, the purpose of the study was to design and develop the serious game inclusive of playful elements for user motivation, the web-based mobile application system for easy accessibility, and Artificial Intelligence- (AI-) based difficulty level adjustment system for prevention from earlier leaving out in the middle of the play so that the elderly users can feel entertaining and immersed into the cognitive game voluntarily. This study was designed as an eight-week pilot experiment with thirty-seven participants in their 60s to 80s for the game's usability assessment purpose. Results of the study showed that the AI-based cognitive exercise game was acceptable, interesting, and motivating for the elderly people and the test results before and after the eight-week training suggest a relationship between longer the training on the game and lower cognitive assessment scores including geriatric quality of life scale, geriatric depression scale, and Korean version of mini-mental state examination (MMSE). These correlations demonstrate the potential value of serious games in clinical assessment of cognitive status for the elderly users with varying cognitive ability. Based on these results, the elderly-centered serious game with playful element can be potentially used in clinical settings, allowing the cognitive training to be more enjoyable and more medically effective. Given these promising results, a more focused study can extend to the game system or additional game tools or features to be explored that solely target the elderly by applying AI and advanced visualization devices."
133,2021,36201480,Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,exercise depression,1.0,"Multiple studies have proved that participating in sports can effectively reduce adults' depression. This paper provides evidence from China by using the survey data from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), which contains sport-types, personal characteristics, and CES-D20 depression-scale score data of 33,236 individuals. In addition to the Ordinary Least Squares regression model, we adopt the Two-way Fixed Effect and Propensity Score Matching method to alleviate the endogeneity. The empirical result shows that for every additional time of physical exercise, the depression level drops by an average of 0.152; the depression level of people who participate in sports is significantly lower than that of non-participants by 0.397 points. The lowering effect of physical activity on depression is not linear, and excessive exercise may lead to increased depression. Furthermore, heterogeneity analyses discover that with the increase of age and education, the impact continued to expand. For every increase in physical exercise of the group over 76-year old, the depression level decreased by 0.373 points; while for individuals with primary school education, their depression level decreased only by 0.124 points."
133,2021,36198459,Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,exercise depression,1.0,"Objectives: To determine the pooled effectiveness and feasibility of telerehabilitation in patients with COVID-19. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data sources: PubMed, CINAHL, Science Direct, PEDro, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to the end of March 2022. Eligibility criteria and outcomes: RCTs investigating the effects of telerehabilitation in the management of patients with COVID-19 were included. The outcomes of interest were functional capacity, cardiopulmonary exercise tests, quality of life and other variables where data are available. Data extraction and synthesis: Two reviewers screened, extracted data and performed methodological quality assessment independently. The revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Review Manager V.5.4 and Stata V.14.0 software were used for statistical analysis. Mean difference (MD) with 95% CI and the corresponding p value were used to determine the treatment effect between groups. A fixed-effect model was used for all variables as no significant heterogeneity was observed. Results: Four studies with 334 patients with COVID-19 were included. The pooled result of telerehabilitation showed statistically significant improvement on 6-minute walking test (MD 75.50; 95% CI 54.69 to 96.30; p=0.48), 30-second sit-to-stand test (MD 1.76; 95% CI 1.47 to 2.04; p=0.30), Borg Scale (MD 2.49; 95% CI 2.16 to 2.83; p=0.28) and level of dyspnoea (MD 6.26; 95% CI 5.42 to 7.10; p=0.66). The overall treatment completion rate was 88.46%, and the most common reason for withdrawal after randomisation was lost to follow-up or uncooperativeness. Conclusions: The findings showed that telerehabilitation interventions could improve functional capacity and exercise perception among patients affected by COVID-19 and can be implemented with a high completion rate and minimal adverse events.

The Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise programmes were adapted Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise (aLiFE) to include more challenging activities and a behavioural change framework, and then enhanced Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise (eLiFE) to be delivered using smartphones and smartwatches. Objectives: To (1) compare adherence measures, (2) identify determinants of adherence and (3) assess the impact on outcome measures of a lifestyle-integrated programme. Design, setting and participants: A multicentre, feasibility randomised controlled trial including participants aged 61-70 years conducted in three European cities. Interventions: Six-month trainer-supported aLiFE or eLiFE compared with a control group, which received written PA advice. Outcome measures: Self-reporting adherence per month using a single question and after 6-month intervention using the Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS, score range 6-24). Treatment outcomes included function and disability scores (measured using the Late-Life Function and Disability Index) and sensor-derived physical behaviour complexity measure. Determinants of adherence (EARS score) were identified using linear multivariate analysis. Linear regression estimated the association of adherence on treatment outcome. Results: We included 120 participants randomised to the intervention groups (aLiFE/eLiFE) (66.3±2.3 years, 53% women). The 106 participants reassessed after 6 months had a mean EARS score of 16.0±5.1. Better adherence was associated with lower number of medications taken, lower depression and lower risk of functional decline. We estimated adherence to significantly increase basic lower extremity function by 1.3 points (p 0.0001), advanced lower extremity function by 1.0 point (p 0.0001) and behavioural complexity by 0.008 per 1.0 point higher EARS score (F(3,91)=3.55, p=0.017) regardless of group allocation. Conclusion: PA adherence was associated with better lower extremity function and physical behavioural complexity. Barriers to adherence should be addressed preintervention to enhance intervention efficacy. Further research is needed to unravel the impact of behaviour change techniques embedded into technology-delivered activity interventions on adherence.

The aim of this study was to explore the effects of SET on CID. Methods: One hundred and eighteen CID were recruited and randomized into medication (MED) or medication combined with SET (MSET) groups. Over 12 observational weeks, sleep and mood status were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). At the end of the observational period, the rates of clinically effective hypnotic use were calculated. At 12 weeks, the PSQI progressively decreased for all subjects combined (P .001) as well as ISI (P .001), ESS (P .001), SDS (P .001), and SAS (P .001). The decreases in PSQI (P .05), ISI (P .05), SDS (P .01), and SAS (P .05) in the MSET group were significantly larger than those in the MED group, but not the same as those in the ESS group (P &gt; .05). At the trial endpoint, the clinically effective rate was significantly higher (P .05) and the hypnotic usage rate was lower (P .05) in the MSET group than in the MED group. SET may be an effective treatment for insomnia in patients with CID."

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on selected physical and psychological parameters, exercise, and nutritional behaviors in diabetic patients. Patients and methods: This was a cross-sectional study of volunteers with type 2 diabetes. Patients were randomized into two groups: an intervention (n=32) and a control group (n=31). The Beck Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to assess physical activity in combination with the Beck Depression Inventory and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess the levels of depression and the quality of sleep. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) training consisted of six sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy interventions. The intervention consisted of a face-to-face individual counseling session. The patients received a special diet according to their basal metabolic rate (BMR). At all sessions, dietary advice was reviewed, and during the treatment period, they were asked to record their diet and physical activity. Body composition and blood samples were measured before and after three months of the experiment for both groups. Results: Blood glucose, blood lipid profiles (except high-density lipoprotein), lifestyle, behavior patterns and body composition were significantly improved following CBT intervention (p≤0.05). Conclusions: CBT can play a key role in improving physiological and psychological parameters in diabetic patients."

This study is a cross-sectional study using a structured questionnaire. The respondent's consent was obtained prior to data collection, and the investigation period runs from November 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. The final analysis included 150 as respondents to the study. The tool developed by Yang was used for psychological well-being, the Korean integrated CES-D tool was used for depression, and the Menopause Symptom Index was used for menopausal symptoms. The differences and levels of psychological well-being, depression, and menopausal symptoms according to demographic and sociological characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t -test, and ANOVA. The correlation between psychological well-being, depression, and menopausal symptoms was analyzed by Pearson's correlation, and the effect on menopausal symptoms was analyzed by multiple regression. Because of this study, significant results were found in marital status, religion, economic level, regular exercise, hobbies, personality, and subjective health in the difference in psychological well-being according to general characteristics. In depression, significant results were found in marital status, education level, monthly income, living status, regular exercise, hobbies, stress, personality, and subjective health status. Moreover, age, frequent exercise, hobby, and subjective health all had a significant impact on menopausal symptoms. According to the findings of the regression analysis, the factors influencing menopausal symptoms were, in that order, depression and psychological well-being. Among the factors that showed significant results for menopausal symptoms, exercise is recommended as a factor that can alleviate menopausal symptoms due to individual lifestyle changes, so it is expected to contribute to reducing menopausal symptoms and improving quality of life."
133,2021,36193083,Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? ,exercise depression,1.0,"Aging is a complex process often associated with a chronic inflammatory profile that alters several biological functions, including the immune system and cognitive and physical capacity. The practice of physical activity is increasingly gaining popularity as a method of preventing infections, depression, and other disorders that affect the quality of life of the elderly. Thus, this work analyzes the profile of cytokines and molecular markers expressed in immune cells of elderly people who practice physical activities or not, evaluating their impacts on the immune system and quality of life. For this, 48 individuals were recruited, and peripheral blood samples were collected for hemogram analysis, cytokine determination, and immunophenotyping. Elderly people were separated into two groups: practitioners with low-intensity physical activity and non-practitioners. Quality of life was assessed using the Whoqol-Old instrument, and depression was assessed using the Beck II Depression Inventory. When comparing the scores of the Whoqol-Old and Beck questionnaires, we observed a significant negative correlation between these two factors. The perception of a higher quality of life was present in the elderly who exercised and was related to greater autonomy and sensory abilities, whereas the presence of depression was lower. In the hemogram, we observed higher basophil and segmented counts in the sedentary elderly, whereas lymphocytes and monocytes had lower counts. Elderly practitioners of physical activities had higher levels of IFN- γ , IL-4, and IL-10; increased expression of CD69, PD1, and TIM-3 in CD4+ T lymphocytes and increased CD14+CD80+ and CD14+CD86+ monocytes. Elderly people with an increased perception of quality of life had higher levels of IFN- γ , higher expression of CD14+CD80+CD86+, and decreased levels of TRAIL. An increase in TRAIL was observed in individuals with depression, in addition to an increased expression of CD14+CD86+. These results show a clear correlation between the quality of life, level of depression, physical activity, and immune system function. Although some cytokines with a typical proinflammatory profile (IFN- γ ) were observed, the results point to a protective state with benefits reflected in the general well-being of the elderly who exercise."

Health care providers need authoritative information to help avoid the costs and risks of ineffective treatment. A review was completed to provide relevant information on infestation treatments available in the United States. Three major biomedical databases were searched from 1985, when current products were first available, to 2014, focusing on U.S. Reports: A total of 579 references remained after duplicates were removed. A search of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration website and labels of approved products were reviewed. A marked decline in the effectiveness of permethrin and synergized pyrethrins was found, probably because of resistance arising from widespread and indiscriminate use, and the emergence of knockdown resistance mutations. The potential toxicity of lindane in the setting of readily available, safer, and more effective alternatives, should limit its use. Prescription products shown to be safe and effective with a single application, without nit combing, are topical ivermectin, malathion, and spinosad, whereas benzyl alcohol requires two applications. Home remedies such as mayonnaise, and essential oils, have not been demonstrated to be safe or effective, and may carry potential for severe adverse events. The high risk of failure of over-the-counter treatments in eliminating head louse infestations drives a need for health care provider recognition of the limitations of current treatments and for judicious use of treatments that remain effective."

The development and registration of new pesticides has become so costly that many chemical companies are unwilling to pursue it and health-care providers now face a serious lack of new commercial pediculicides. Many infested people resort to using ""home-remedy"" approaches that have not been scientifically tested. In this article, we examined the potential value of six purportedly effective ""home remedies"" (vinegar, isopropyl alcohol, olive oil, mayonnaise, melted butter, and petroleum jelly) to treat head louse infestations and the likelihood of drowning lice by water submersion. Results indicated that only the application of petroleum jelly caused significant louse mortality but no treatment prevented lice from laying eggs. Most home remedy products did little to kill eggs, despite prolonged exposure. Petroleum jelly caused the greatest egg mortality, allowing only 6% to hatch. It was extremely difficult to drown lice, despite extended periods (i.e., 8 hr) of water submersion, suggesting that killing lice by depriving them of oxygen is inefficient. None of the home remedy products we surveyed was an effective means of louse control. This suggests that when treatment failure occurs, an increased amount of time and effort should be focused on alternative chemical pediculicides and/or manual louse removal (i.e., combing) rather than using any of these products."
135,2021,10937452,Can applying mayonnaise help get rid of lice?,mayonnaise lice treatment,0.0,"Head louse infestations (pediculosis) are prevalent worldwide. In developed countries, the infestation rate of 4- to 13-year-old children remains high despite preventive efforts. This is due to the existence of numerous ineffective pediculicides, the incorrect use of the effective agents, toxicological concerns and the development of louse strains resistant to insecticides. One of the most effective tools for the prevention and control of lice is the louse comb, which should be used regularly for the detection of living lice at an early stage of infestation, and as an accessory to any treatment method to remove living and dead lice. The louse comb can also be used systematically for the treatment of infestations, for confirmation that treatment with pediculicides has been successful, and for the removal of nits (dead eggs or egg shells). Most pediculicides are only partially ovicidal. Therefore, 10 days after beginning treatment with any antilouse product, the scalp of the child should be examined. If no living lice are found, the treatment should be discontinued. If living lice are still present, treatment should be continued with a product containing a different active ingredient. Suffocating agents such as olive, soya, sunflower and corn oils, hair gels and mayonnaise are able to kill a significant number of lice only if they are applied in liberal quantities for more than 12 hours. However, they lubricate the hair and therefore may facilitate combing and removing lice and eggs from the scalp. Nits may remain glued on the hair for at least 6 months, even after a successful treatment, and lead to a false positive diagnosis of louse infestation. If nits are seen on the hair, the child should be examined, but treatment should be initiated only if living lice are found. Formulations containing 5% acetic acid or 8% formic acid, as well as acid shampoos (pH 4.5 to 5.5) and conditioners, in combination with a louse comb, can be helpful for removing nits. There is no conclusive evidence that using essential oils to repel lice is effective. Regular examination of the child's head using a louse comb is the best measure to detect re-infestation at an early stage. Educating caregivers, nurses and teachers about louse biology, epidemiology, prevention and control is of paramount importance. The psychological effect of an infestation with lice is significant and often associated with anxiety and fear. The child should not be made to feel responsible for having lice, or be punished or reprimanded."

Iron replacement therapy dates back to the seventeenth century, and has progressed relatively slowly until recently. Both oral and intravenous traditional iron formulations are known to be far from ideal, mainly because of tolerability and safety issues, respectively. At the beginning of this century, the discovery of hepcidin/ferroportin axis has represented a turning point in the knowledge of the pathophysiology of iron metabolism disorders, ushering a new era. In the meantime, advances in the pharmaceutical technologies are producing newer iron formulations aimed at minimizing the problems inherent with traditional approaches. The pharmacokinetic of oral and parenteral iron is substantially different, and diversities have become even clearer in light of the hepcidin master role in regulating systemic iron homeostasis. Here we review how iron therapy is changing because of such important advances in both pathophysiology and pharmacology."

The almost complete skeleton was recovered from the cemetery of St Owen and dates to the late medieval period. Several methods were used to determine the sex and age of the individual. The anthropological examination showed that the remains belonged to a young male, between the ages of 17 and 19 years. The young man also had antemortem pathologies that were related to his diet and lifestyle, as he appears to have had iron-deficiency anemia and Schmorl nodes. The trauma observed on the remains consisted of 3 cut marks located on the cranium, left radius, and right scapula. The cuts seem to have been inflicted by a heavy weapon, such as a sword. The trauma pattern observed is consistent with defensive action, and the fact that this skeleton was the only one in the collection that has evidence of trauma suggests that this was a case of interpersonal violence."

Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed for patients treated in the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Gastroenterology clinics between the dates of July 1, 2007 and October 1, 2010. The selection of cases for review was initiated by use of our electronic medical record to identify all patients with a diagnosis of angioectasia, angiodysplasia, or arteriovenous malformation. Of these cases, chart reviews identified patients who had a complete evaluation of their gastrointestinal tract as defined by at least one upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and small bowel capsule endoscopy within the past three years. Patients without evidence of overt gastrointestinal bleeding or iron deficiency anemia associated with intestinal angioectasias were classified as asymptomatic and excluded from this analysis. Thirty-five patients with confirmed, bleeding intestinal angioectasias who had undergone complete endoscopic evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract were included in the final analysis. Results: A total of 127 cases were reviewed. Sixty-six were excluded during subsequent screening due to lack of complete small bowel evaluation and/or lack of documentation of overt bleeding or iron deficiency anemia. The 61 remaining cases were carefully examined with independent review of endoscopic images as well as complete capsule endoscopy videos. This analysis excluded 26 additional cases due to insufficient records/images for review, incomplete capsule examination, poor capsule visualization or lack of confirmation of typical angioectasias by the principal investigator on independent review. Thirty-five cases met criteria for final analysis. All study patients were age 50 years or older and 13 patients (37.1%) had chronic kidney disease stage 3 or higher. Twenty of 35 patients were taking aspirin (81 mg or 325 mg), clopidogrel, and/or warfarin, with 8/20 on combination therapy. The number and location of angioectasis was documented for each case. Lesions were then classified into the following segments of the gastrointestinal tract: esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, right colon and left colon. The location of lesions within the small bowel observed by capsule endoscopy was generally defined by percentage of total small bowel transit time with times of 0%-9%, 10%-39%, and 40%-100% corresponding to the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, respectively. Independent review of complete capsule studies allowed for deviation from this guideline if capsule passage was delayed in one or more segments. In addition, the location and number of angioectasias observed in the small bowel was further modified or confirmed by subsequent device-assisted enteroscopy (DAE) performed in the 83% of cases. In our study population, angioectasias were most commonly found in the jejunum (80%) followed by the duodenum (51%), stomach (22.8%), and right colon (11.4%). Only two patients were found to have angioectasias in the ileum (5.7%). Twenty-one patients (60%) had angioectasias in more than one location. Conclusion: Patients being considered for endoscopic ablation of symptomatic angioectasias should undergo push enteroscopy or anterograde DAE and re-inspection of the right colon."

All infants received banked breast milk in the hospital and breast milk or cow milk formula later; those with odd birth dates received 2 mg iron as ferrous sulfate/kg/day starting at 0.5 months; those with even birth dates received no additional iron unless they developed anemia. The results indicate that low-birth-weight infants who receive no supplemental iron may develop iron deficiency by three months of age and that a dose of iron of 2 mg/kg/day started at two weeks of age prevents iron deficiency without providing excess."

Since birth weights are influenced by maternal factors like height and parity, a trial was carried on in matched controls with iron and iron and folic acid during the last 12 to 16 weeks of pregnancy. Simultaneously, placental function was also assessed. The effect of the folic acid supplements was more marked on first born children. Incidence of small-for-dates births was half in the iron and folate-supplemented group as compared with the iron-supplemented group. The heights of mothers did not make any difference on the effect of folate supplement. The improvement in the birth weights seem to have been brought about by increase in placental size, cell number, and protein content in the folate supplement group. In view of multivariant deficiency and practical problems in implementing food supplement programs to expectant mothers, supplements of folate and iron to expectant mothers in large scale may bring about an improvement in the incidence of pregnancy anemia and also reduce the infant morbidity and mortality rate due to the high incidence of low-birth weight babies."

However, there is no nationwide program where these children are managed with take-home therapeutic/supplementary food as recommended by World Health Organization. Objective: This study aimed to identify the changes in nutritional status and morbidities over 3 months of U-5 children having severe wasting (ie, SAM) whose parents refused to admit their children in the residential nutrition rehabilitation unit of the Dhaka Hospital of icddr, b (an international health research Institute based in Dhaka, Bangladesh), and instead attended the nutrition follow-up unit (NFU), and thus did not receive any food supplementation during nutritional rehabilitation. Methods: At the NFU, these SAM children on every visit (fortnightly to monthly) received health and nutrition education, multivitamins, zinc and iron supplements, and treatment of illnesses if any. Results: During the study period, a total 180 U-5 SAM children came regularly for NFU visit for at least 3 months, and they comprised our study sample. Their age at first NFU visit (baseline) was 13.4 ± 7.8 months and 46% were female. Over these 3 month follow-up period, the rate of weight gain was 2.2 ± 1.9 g/kg/d, change in mid upper arm circumference was from 105 to 115 mm, and change in weight-for-length or weight-for-height z-score was from -2.70 ± 0.94 to -1.95 ± 1.00. During the prior 14 days to the 4 NFU follow-up visit, 13.6% to 22.8% had common cold and/or cough, and 12.2% to 15.1% had pneumonia.

The quality of selected studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and certainty in the outcomes was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. The review found that micronutrients supplementation, except vitamin C, may not prevent cold incidence or reduce symptom severity among healthy adults. However, zinc supplementation was observed to potentially reduce cold duration by 2.25 days (when zinc is provided singly, 95% CI: -3.39, -1.12). This suggests that zinc supplementation may reduce the overall burden due to common cold among healthy adults."
138,2021,31980506,Can zinc help treat the common cold?,zinc common cold,1.0,"Objective: To examine a commercially available zinc acetate lozenge for treating the common cold. Design: Randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Working population in Finland. Participants: We included men and women aged ≥18 years who usually had ≥1 cold per winter. Exclusions were pregnancy, lactation, chronic runny nose or chronic cough. Intervention: We randomised 253 participants to receive a package of lozenges to be taken if they caught the common cold. Of the 253 participants, 88 contracted the common cold and 87 were included in our primary analysis. Zinc acetate lozenges contained 13 mg elemental zinc and placebo lozenges contained sucrose octa-acetate to camouflage the taste of zinc. Instruction to use was six times per day for the maximum of 5 days. Primary outcome: Rate of recovery from the common cold analysed by Cox regression. Results: There was no difference in the recovery rate between zinc and placebo participants during the 10-day follow-up (rate ratio for zinc vs placebo=0.68, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.08; p=0.10). The recovery rate for the two groups was similar during the 5-day intervention, but for 2 days after the end of zinc/placebo use, the zinc participants recovered significantly slower compared with the placebo participants (p=0.003). In the zinc group, 37% did not report adverse effects, the corresponding proportion being 69% in the placebo group. Conclusions: A commercially available zinc acetate lozenge was not effective in treating the common cold when instructed to be used for 5 days after the first symptoms. Taste has been a common problem in previous zinc lozenge trials, but a third of zinc participants did not complain of any adverse effects. More research is needed to evaluate the characteristics of zinc lozenges that may be clinically efficacious before zinc lozenges can be widely promoted for common cold treatment.

Patients typically present with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, general malaise, and/or low-grade fever. Informing patients about the self-limited nature of the common cold can help manage expectations, limit antibiotic use, and avoid over-the-counter purchases that may not help. Treatments with proven effectiveness for cold symptoms in adults include over-the-counter analgesics, zinc, nasal decongestants with or without antihistamines, and ipratropium for cough. Lower-quality evidence suggests that Lactobacillus casei may be beneficial in older adults. The only established safe and effective treatments for children are acetylcysteine, honey (for children one year and older), nasal saline irrigation, intranasal ipratropium, and topical application of ointment containing camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oils. Over-the-counter cold medications should not be used in children younger than four years. Counseling patients about the importance of good hand hygiene is the best way to prevent transmission of cold viruses."
138,2021,31305906,Can zinc help treat the common cold?,zinc common cold,1.0,"Zinc is an essential trace element that is crucial for growth, development, and the maintenance of immune function. Its influence reaches all organs and cell types, representing an integral component of approximately 10% of the human proteome, and encompassing hundreds of key enzymes and transcription factors. Zinc deficiency is strikingly common, affecting up to a quarter of the population in developing countries, but also affecting distinct populations in the developed world as a result of lifestyle, age, and disease-mediated factors. Consequently, zinc status is a critical factor that can influence antiviral immunity, particularly as zinc-deficient populations are often most at risk of acquiring viral infections such as HIV or hepatitis C virus. This review summarizes current basic science and clinical evidence examining zinc as a direct antiviral, as well as a stimulant of antiviral immunity. An abundance of evidence has accumulated over the past 50 y to demonstrate the antiviral activity of zinc against a variety of viruses, and via numerous mechanisms. The therapeutic use of zinc for viral infections such as herpes simplex virus and the common cold has stemmed from these findings; however, there remains much to be learned regarding the antiviral mechanisms and clinical benefit of zinc supplementation as a preventative and therapeutic treatment for viral infections."
138,2021,28494765,Can zinc help treat the common cold?,zinc common cold,1.0,"Background: The relative scale has been used for decades in analysing binary data in epidemiology. In contrast, there has been a long tradition of carrying out meta-analyses of continuous outcomes on the absolute, original measurement, scale. The biological rationale for using the relative scale in the analysis of binary outcomes is that it adjusts for baseline variations; however, similar baseline variations can occur in continuous outcomes and relative effect scale may therefore be often useful also for continuous outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine whether the relative scale is more consistent with empirical data on treating the common cold than the absolute scale. Methods: Individual patient data was available for 2 randomized trials on zinc lozenges for the treatment of the common cold. Mossad (Ann Intern Med 125:81-8, 1996) found 4.0 days and 43% reduction, and Petrus (Curr Ther Res 59:595-607, 1998) found 1.77 days and 25% reduction, in the duration of colds. In both trials, variance in the placebo group was significantly greater than in the zinc lozenge group. The effect estimates were applied to the common cold distributions of the placebo groups, and the resulting distributions were compared with the actual zinc lozenge group distributions. Results: When the absolute effect estimates, 4.0 and 1.77 days, were applied to the placebo group common cold distributions, negative and zero (i.e., impossible) cold durations were predicted, and the high level variance remained. In contrast, when the relative effect estimates, 43 and 25%, were applied, impossible common cold durations were not predicted in the placebo groups, and the cold distributions became similar to those of the zinc lozenge groups. Conclusions: For some continuous outcomes, such as the duration of illness and the duration of hospital stay, the relative scale leads to a more informative statistical analysis and more effective communication of the study findings. The transformation of continuous data to the relative scale is simple with a spreadsheet program, after which the relative scale data can be analysed using standard meta-analysis software. The option for the analysis of relative effects of continuous outcomes directly from the original data should be implemented in standard meta-analysis programs."
138,2021,27378206,Can zinc help treat the common cold?,zinc common cold,1.0,"Aims: The aim of this study was to determine whether the allergy status and other characteristics of common cold patients modify the effects of zinc acetate lozenges. Methods: We had available individual patient data for three randomized placebo-controlled trials in which zinc acetate lozenges were administered to common cold patients. We used both one stage and two stage meta-analysis to estimate the effects of zinc lozenges. Results: The total number of common cold patients was 199, the majority being females. Eighty percent of them fell into the age range 20-50 years. One third of the patients had allergies. The one stage meta-analysis gave an overall estimate of 2.73 days (95% CI 1.8, 3.3 days) shorter colds by zinc acetate lozenge usage. The two stage meta-analysis gave an estimate of 2.94 days (95% CI 2.1, 3.8 days) reduction in common cold duration. These estimates are to be compared with the 7 day average duration of colds in the three trials. The effect of zinc lozenges was not modified by allergy status, smoking, baseline severity of the common cold, age, gender or ethnic group. Conclusion: Since the effects of zinc acetate lozenges were consistent between the compared subgroups, the overall estimates for effect seemed applicable over a wide range of common cold patients. While the optimal composition of zinc lozenges and the best frequency of their administration should be further investigated, given the current evidence of efficacy, common cold patients may be encouraged to try zinc lozenges for treating their colds."
141,2021,25255817,Does cocoa butter help reduce pregnancy stretch marks?,cocoa butter reduce pregnancy stretch marks,0.0,"Striae gravidarum (SG), or stretch marks developing during pregnancy, affect up to 90% of women. While not medically dangerous, SG can be disfiguring, causing emotional and psychological distress. However, studies specifically addressing the prevention of SG, especially during pregnancy, are sparse. Furthermore, the molecular pathogenesis of SG is unclear and may differ from that of striae from other causes. Considering these factors, we review topical modalities that have been used specifically for preventing SG during pregnancy. We identify two major strategies (end points) addressed by these modalities, namely (i) preventing the de novo development of SG and (ii) reducing the severity of SG that have recently developed. We also identify risk factors for the development of SG and suggest that pregnant women with these risk factors are an appropriate target population for prevention. In reviewing the literature, we find that there is limited evidence that centella, and possibly massage with bitter almond oil, may prevent SG and/or reduce their severity. There is weak evidence that hyaluronic acid prevents SG. Tretinoin holds promise for reducing the severity of new-onset SG, but its use is limited by its pregnancy category. Finally, cocoa butter and olive oil are not effective for preventing SG or reducing the severity of lesions. We conclude that reliable methods for preventing SG are scarce. Furthermore, available topical modalities generally lack strong evidence from rigorous, well-designed, randomized controlled trials with ample numbers of subjects. Thus, further research is necessary to elucidate SG pathogenesis, which may lead to effective prevention modalities."

A fixed drug eruption (FDE) was diagnosed and the patient was asked to avoid Tylenol and other OTC lozenges. Tylenol was entered as an allergy in the electronic medical records. However, since Tylenol, not acetaminophen was listed in the allergy profile, the order for acetaminophen and codeine did not generate an alert for the prescribing physician. Additionally, the dispensing pharmacist did not question the prescribing physician and the patient, unaware that acetaminophen in the pain medication is the same drug as Tylenol, took it and developed recurrent FDE."

Published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol or Tylenol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line pharmacologic therapy. The comparative safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs is also important to consider. This update to the original 2003 review includes nine additional RCTs. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, arthrotec, celecoxib, naproxen, rofecoxib) for treating OA. Search strategy: We searched MEDLINE (up to July 2005), EMBASE (2002-July 2005), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ACP Journal Club, DARE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (all from 1994 to July 2005). Reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles were also hand searched. Selection criteria: Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen alone in OA were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Pain, physical function and global assessment outcomes were reported. Results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as standardized mean differences (SMD). Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk (RR) and the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated. Main results: Fifteen RCTs involving 5986 participants were included in this review. Seven RCTs compared acetaminophen to placebo and ten RCTs compared acetaminophen to NSAIDs. In the placebo-controlled RCTs, acetaminophen was superior to placebo in five of the seven RCTs and had a similar safety profile. Compared to placebo, a pooled analysis of five trials of overall pain using multiple methods demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.04), which is of questionable clinical significance. The relative percent improvement from baseline was 5% with an absolute change of 4 points on a 0 to 100 scale. The NNT to achieve an improvement in pain ranged from 4 to 16. In the comparator-controlled RCTs, acetaminophen was less effective overall than NSAIDs in terms of pain reduction, global assessments and in terms of improvements in functional status. No significant difference was found overall between the safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs, although patients taking traditional NSAIDS were more likely to experience an adverse GI event (RR 1.47, (95% CI 1.08 to 2.00). 19% of patients in the traditional NSAID group versus 13% in the acetaminophen group experienced an adverse GI event. However, the median trial duration was only 6 weeks and it is difficult to assess adverse outcomes in a relatively short time period. Authors' conclusions: The evidence to date suggests that NSAIDs are superior to acetaminophen for improving knee and hip pain in people with OA. The size of the treatment effect was modest, and the median trial duration was only six weeks, therefore, additional considerations need to be factored in when making the decision between using acetaminophen or NSAIDs. In OA subjects with moderate-to-severe levels of pain, NSAIDs appear to be more effective than acetaminophen."

Effective, scalable, and feasible interventions are needed. Music interventions have shown promising effects, but the current evidence base is inconclusive. The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of two different music interventions on the depressive symptoms of people with dementia living in residential aged care. Methods: We implemented a 2 × 2 factorial cluster-randomised controlled trial to determine whether group music therapy (GMT) is more effective than no GMT with standard care, or recreational choir singing (RCS) is more effective than no RCS with standard care, for reducing depressive symptoms and other secondary outcomes in people with dementia with mild to severe depressive symptoms living in residential aged care. Care home units with at least ten residents were allocated to GMT, RCS, GMT plus RCS, or standard care, using a computer-generated list with block randomisation (block size four). The protocolised interventions were delivered by music therapists (GMT) and community musicians (RCS). The primary outcome was Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score at 6 months, assessed by a masked assessor and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using linear mixed-effects models, which examined the effects of GMT versus no-GMT and RCS versus no-RCS, as well as interaction effects of GMT and RCS.

Findings: Between June 15, 2018, and Feb 18, 2020, we approached 12 RAC facilities with 26 eligible care home units and, excluding six units who could not be enrolled due to COVID-19 lockdowns, we screened 818 residents. Between July 18, 2018, and Nov 26, 2019, 20 care home units were randomised (318 residents). Recruitment ceased on March 17, 2020, due to COVID-19. The primary endpoint, available from 20 care home units (214 residents), suggested beneficial effects of RCS (mean difference -4·25, 95% CI -7·89 to -0·62; p=0·0221) but not GMT (mean difference -0·44, -4·32 to 3·43; p=0·8224).

144,2021,36045957,Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,"In order to evaluate the therapeutic effect of music therapy on patients with depression, this paper proposes a CNN-based noise detection method with the combination of HHT and FastICA for noise removal, with good data support from the DBN model. DBN-based feature extraction and classification are completed. As the training process of DBN itself requires a large number of training samples, there are also disadvantages such as slow convergence speed and easy to fall into local minima, which lead to a large amount of effort and time, and the learning efficiency is relatively low. A DBN optimization algorithm based on artificial neural network was proposed to evaluate the efficacy of music therapy. First of all, through the comparison of music therapy experimental group and control group, to verify that music therapy is effective for the treatment of depressed patients. Secondly, we propose to optimize the selection of features based on the frequency band energy ratio and the sliding average sample entropy, respectively, and then to classify the EEG of depressed patients under different music perceptions by training the DBN model and continuously adjusting the parameters, combined with the surtax classifier, and the classification accuracy is high. In particular, it can detect the different effects of different music styles, which is of great significance for the selection of appropriate music for the treatment of depressed patients."
144,2021,36031855,Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,"Background: Non-pharmacological interventions such as music are being increasingly used in clinical settings. Objective: To assess the effects of music on patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) surgery under subarachnoid anesthesia. Methods: This randomized controlled trial examined participants (45/group) in a music and non-music group. Anxiety was measured in both the groups using (1) the adapted hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), (2) Spielberger state trait anxiety inventory (STAI-S), (3) visual analog scale (VAS), (4) cortisol levels, and (5) blood pressure. Music was delivered using an MP3 player and headphones. Hemodynamic data was collected before, during, and after music therapy. Cortisol and stress levels were measured postoperatively. VAS was assessed 30 min before surgery, 30 min after the administration of anesthesia, and 30 min after the surgery ended in the recovery room to obtain comparative data on pain levels at 3 different phases using a numeric rating scale. Results: Changes in the mean VAS scores from the pre-to postoperative phase were significantly different between the music and non-music groups ( p = .001). The mean (±standard deviation [SD]) HADS and STAI-S scores of the non-music group were higher than those in the music group (HADS:15.58 ± 2.231 vs 11.91 ± 3.218; STAI-S: 54.04 ± 2.899 vs 48.87 ± 4.595). There were significant differences in the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure and mean heart rate between the groups based on time (both, p .001). Correlation regression analysis for the cortisol level revealed a certain relationship between age and cortisol level ( p .05). Conclusions: These results suggest that music can reduce patients' anxiety level in the operating room. Studies on music therapy for patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery, especially under subarachnoid anesthesia, are extremely limited. Therefore, this study can serve as a reference regarding the application of music therapy in the medical field."

People living with COPD or ILD often suffer from chronic and severe breathlessness, with limited treatment options and low engagement rates with current therapies. Group singing represents a potential community-based therapy to improve quality of life for patients with COPD or ILD and breathlessness. Methods: This protocol papers describes SINFONIA, a parallel, double-arm, randomised, blinded-analysis, mixed-methods phase II/III trial of guided, online group singing that will be conducted over 24 months. Adults with confirmed COPD or ILD, on stable treatment for at least four weeks at time of recruitment, with a modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea score of two or greater, who are capable and willing to give consent, and not currently participating in pulmonary rehabilitation will be eligible to participate. Carers may optionally enrol in the trial. Data will be collected on quality of life, anxiety and depression, breathlessness, mastery of breathing, exercise tolerance, loneliness, healthcare utilisation, and carer quality of life (optional). Participants will be randomised 1:1 to intervention or control arms with intervention arm attending one 90 min, guided, online, group singing session per week for 12 weeks and control arm continuing routine care. Phase II of the trial aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of guided, online group singing and will collect preliminary data on effectiveness. Phase III aims to determine whether guided, online group singing has an effect on quality of life with the primary outcome being a between arm difference in quality of life (36-item Short Form Survey) measured at 12 weeks. Discussion: SINFONIA is the first study is the first of its kind in Australia and to our knowledge, the first to deliver the singing intervention program entirely online. Determining the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of guided, online group singing is an important step towards improving low-cost, low-risk, community-based therapeutic options for patients living with COPD or ILD and breathlessness.

Objectives: To compare the effect of music therapy (MT) in addition to standard care versus standard care alone, or to standard care plus an active control intervention, on psychological symptoms, substance craving, motivation for treatment, and motivation to stay clean/sober. Search methods: We searched the following databases (from inception to 1 February 2021): the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Specialised Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE (PubMed); eight other databases, and two trials registries. We handsearched reference lists of all retrieved studies and relevant systematic reviews. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials comparing MT plus standard care to standard care alone, or MT plus standard care to active intervention plus standard care for people with SUD. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methodology. Main results: We included 21 trials involving 1984 people. We found moderate-certainty evidence of a medium effect favouring MT plus standard care over standard care alone for substance craving (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.23 to -0.10; 3 studies, 254 participants), with significant subgroup differences indicating greater reduction in craving for MT intervention lasting one to three months; and small-to-medium effect favouring MT for motivation for treatment/change (SMD 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.61; 5 studies, 408 participants). We found no clear evidence of a beneficial effect on depression (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.72 to 0.07; 3 studies, 100 participants), or motivation to stay sober/clean (SMD 0.22, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.47; 3 studies, 269 participants), though effect sizes ranged from large favourable effect to no effect, and we are uncertain about the result. There was no evidence of beneficial effect on anxiety (mean difference (MD) -0.17, 95% CI -4.39 to 4.05; 1 study, 60 participants), though we are uncertain about the result. There was no meaningful effect for retention in treatment for participants receiving MT plus standard care as compared to standard care alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% 0.93 to 1.05; 6 studies, 199 participants). There was a moderate effect on motivation for treatment/change when comparing MT plus standard care to another active intervention plus standard care (SMD 0.46, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.93; 5 studies, 411 participants), and certainty in the result was moderate. We found no clear evidence of an effect of MT on motivation to stay sober/clean when compared to active intervention, though effect sizes ranged from large favourable effect to no effect, and we are uncertain about the result (MD 0.34, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.78; 3 studies, 258 participants). There was no clear evidence of effect on substance craving (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.48; 3 studies, 232 participants), depression (MD -1.49, 95% CI -4.98 to 2.00; 1 study, 110 participants), or substance use (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; 1 study, 140 participants) at one-month follow-up when comparing MT plus standard care to active intervention plus standard care. There were no data on adverse effects. Unclear risk of selection bias applied to most studies due to incomplete description of processes of randomisation and allocation concealment. All studies were at unclear risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors for subjective outcomes (mostly self-report). We judged that bias arising from such lack of blinding would not differ between groups. Similarly, it is not possible to blind participants and providers to MT. We consider knowledge of receiving this type of therapy as part of the therapeutic effect itself, and thus all studies were at low risk of performance bias for subjective outcomes. We downgraded all outcomes one level for imprecision due to optimal information size not being met, and two levels for outcomes with very low sample size. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Results from this review suggest that MT as 'add on' treatment to standard care can lead to moderate reductions in substance craving and can increase motivation for treatment/change for people with SUDs receiving treatment in detoxification and short-term rehabilitation settings. Greater reduction in craving is associated with MT lasting longer than a single session. We have moderate-to-low confidence in our findings as the included studies were downgraded in certainty due to imprecision, and most included studies were conducted by the same researcher in the same detoxification unit, which considerably impacts the transferability of findings."
144,2021,35487736,Can music therapy help manage depression?,music therapy depression,1.0,"Introduction: Australian nurses have experienced higher levels of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the prepandemic. This may have affected their long-term mental health and intention to stay in the profession resulting in a workforce shortage, which further impacts the health of the public. Management is urgently required to improve nurses' well-being. However, there is limited evidence available. The proposed clinical trial aims to evaluate the feasibility and therapeutic effects of using a combination of light acupuncture and five-element music therapy to improve nurses' mental health and well-being during and post-COVID-19. Methods and analysis: This randomised, single blinding, two-arm cross-over feasibility study involves a 1-week run-in period, 2-week intervention and 1-week run-in period in between interventions. Thirty-six eligible nurses will be recruited from the community and randomised into either a combination of light acupuncture treatment and five-element music therapy group or no treatment group for 2 weeks. After a 1-week run in period, they will be swapped to the different group. The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a combination of light acupuncture treatment and five-element music therapy to improve nurses' mental health and well-being. The secondary outcomes will include anxiety and depression, work productivity and activity, and quality of life assessments. Participants will be asked to complete a set of online questionnaires throughout the trial period. All analyses will be performed in R Studio V.1.1.463. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval was attained from Edith Cowan University's Human Research Ethics Committee (No. 2021-02728-WANG).

The aim of this study was to obtain estimates of effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids in BPD using meta-analysis, with a priori differentiation of affective, impulsive, and cognitive-perceptual symptom domains. Data sources: We performed a literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE, using terms related to BPD and omega-3 fatty acids. Publication date was not a restriction. Study selection: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared omega-3 fatty acids to placebo or any active comparator and pooled data using meta-analysis. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis, describing 4 RCTs testing effects of omega-3 fatty acids in 137 patients with BPD or BPD-related behavior. Data extraction: Using a pre-piloted data extraction form, we obtained data including intervention dose, duration, and BPD symptom scale scores, differentiating affective, impulsive, and cognitive-perceptual symptom domains. Results: Random effects meta-analysis showed an overall significant decreasing effect of omega-3 fatty acids on overall BPD symptom severity (0.54 standardized difference in means [SDM]; 95% CI = 0.91 to 0.17; Z = 2.87; P = .0041), without heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 0.00; Q = 2.63; P = .45). A priori differentiation of relevant symptom domains showed significant effects on affect dysregulation (0.74 SDM; 95% CI = 1.21 to 0.27; Z = 3.11; P = .002) and impulsive behavior (0.45 SDM; 95% CI = 0.84 to 0.059; Z = 2.26; P = .024). However, effects on cognitive-perceptual symptoms did not reach the significance threshold. Conclusions: Available data indicate that marine omega-3 fatty acids improve symptoms of BPD, particularly impulsive behavioral dyscontrol and affective dysregulation. Marine omega-3 fatty acids could be considered as add-on therapy."
145,2021,31693423,Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,omega 3 borderline personality disorder,1.0,"Introduction : The treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD) remains an open question for clinicians. There is scarce evidence available and the guidelines' conclusions diverge. Together with these factors, the complexity of BPD generates uncertainty in day-to-day practice. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of advances in BPD treatment and posit a critical opinion based on clinical evidence and practice. Areas covered : The authors review the clinical trials concerning the efficacy of the main classes of drugs in BPD: antidepressants, mood stabilizers, first-, second-, and third-generation antipsychotics, and other agents (opiate antagonists, clonidine, oxytocin, omega-3 fatty acids). They also include in this review studies on combinations of drugs and psychotherapies. Expert opinion : An individualized, tailored pharmacotherapy for BPD that targets the prominent symptom clusters can improve relevant aspects of the clinical picture. However, no medication is indicated to treat the global psychopathology of BPD. Polypharmacy should be avoided or strictly limited. To date, pharmacotherapy alone does not suffice to manage the complexity of BPD. Combining medication with psychotherapy may improve specific BPD symptom dimensions. In particular, it may help those aspects that respond slowly or not at all to monotherapy."

On this basis, a new application for omega-3 fatty acids has been proposed, concerning the treatment of several psychiatric disorders. The present article is an update of a previous systematic review and is aimed to provide a complete report of data published in the period between 1980 and 2019 on efficacy and tolerability of omega-3 fatty acids in psychiatric disorders. In July 2019, an electronic search on PUBMED, Medline and PsychINFO of all RCTs, systematic reviews and meta-analyses on omega-3 fatty acids and psychiatric disorders without any filter or MESH restriction was performed. After eligibility processes, the final number of records included in this review was 126. One hundred and two of these studies were RCTs, while 24 were reviews and meta-analyses. The role of omega-3 fatty acids was studied in schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders, eating disorders, substance use disorder and borderline personality disorder. The main evidence of the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids has been obtained in treating depressive symptoms in patients with major depression and, to a lesser degree, bipolar depression. Some efficacy was also found in early phases of schizophrenia in addition to antipsychotic treatment, but not in the chronic phases of psychosis. Small beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids were observed in ADHD and positive results were reported in a few trials on core symptoms of borderline personality disorder. For other psychiatric disorders results are inconsistent."

In a previous 12-week randomized trial we assessed the efficacy of the combination of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with valproic acid, in comparison with valproic acid monotherapy, in 43 BPD outpatients. Combined therapy was superior to valproic acid monotherapy (the control group) in the treatment of some BPD symptoms: impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol, outbursts of anger, and self-harm. The present study is a 24-week follow-up aimed at evaluating whether the differences in efficacy between the two subgroups were maintained after discontinuation of omega-3 fatty acids. Methods: Thirty-four patients who completed the 12-week trial entered the follow-up study. Participants were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the follow-up period using the rating scales that showed a significant difference between the groups after the 12-week trial with fatty acids supplementation: the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI) (items 'impulsivity' and 'outbursts of anger'), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Version 11 (BIS-11), and Self Harm Inventory (SHI). Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Results: At the end of the follow-up a significant difference within groups was maintained for all four variables examined, while a significant difference between groups was maintained for outbursts of anger. Concerning tolerability, no clinically significant adverse effects were registered during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Combined therapy with omega-3 fatty acids showed long-lasting effects after discontinuation in terms of anger control.

This review summarises the current evidence up to August 2014 and also aims to identify research trends in terms of ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as well as research gaps. There is some evidence for beneficial effects by second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers and omega-3 fatty acids, while the overall evidence base is still unsatisfying. The dominating role SSRI antidepressants usually play within the medical treatment of BPD patients is neither reflected nor supported by corresponding evidence.

The DSM-5 will highlight refractory affective, interpersonal, and identity symptoms in BPD as potential treatment targets. In addition to providing a framework for clinical decision-making, future research strategies will also focus on neurotransmitter systems of greater relevance to understanding overall personality functioning. Recent findings: Although only a few randomized controlled trials of psychopharmacological treatments for BPD have been published recently, several meta-analyses and systematic reviews converge on the consensus effectiveness of lamotrigine, topiramate, valproate, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. Stronger evidence exists for treating disinhibition and antagonism than negative affectivity, particularly interpersonal facets of such traits. In addition, basic research suggests a future role for modifying glutamatergic, opioid, and oxytocinergic neurotransmitter systems to treat BPD. Summary: Clinicians should utilize omega-3, anticonvulsants, and atypical antipsychotic agents in treating specific DSM-5 BPD traits, notably disinhibition, antagonism, and some aspects of negative affectivity. Future research will focus on normalizing opioid and oxytocin dysregulation, as an adjunct to evidence-based psychotherapy, in an effort to improve interpersonal functioning."
146,2021,35380750,Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,vitamin d asthma attacks,1.0,"Background: Globally, the number of diagnosed asthma has increased by 4.3 million from 2001 to 2009.The prevalence of asthma in Africa has increased from 64.9 million (11.8%)to 102.9 million (13.8%) over the past two decades among children less than 15 years. The burden of this consequence is the exacerbations of attacks with resultant absence from school by children, loss of man hour by parents who stay with them while on admission as well as increased healthcare expenditures. The association between the serum level of vitamin D with the severity of the asthmatic attack and its control has been reported in respect of its role as a significant immunomodulator and inhibition in the pathogenesis of allergies. The aim of the study was to correlate serum 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D with the severity of Asthmatic attack in children and possibly provide a rationale for clinical supplementation. Materials and methods: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study conducted between November 2016and August 2017 involving 128 participants. A stratified random sampling method was used to select the participants based on control a level using the GINA classification of asthma control levels. Serum vitamin D level was determined by CalbiotechInc, kit and Pearson correlation was carried out to determine relationship. Results: The uncontrolled (22.4±2.9ng/mL) and partly controlled (25.6±3.9ng/mL) groups had low serum vitamin D levels as compared to the well-controlled group (35.1±4.9ng/mL) which had vitamin D within the reference interval. There was a strong negative correlation (p-value 0.001) between serum vitamin D levels and all the criteria (GINA) of asthma control. Conclusion: The serum vitamin D levels correlated well with the severity of an asthmatic attack as well as its control (GINA)."

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the relationship of vitamin D with asthma severity, attacks, and clinical and functional parameters in adult patients with asthma who were living in different geographic regions in Turkey. Methods: A total of 384 patients with stable asthma and 87 control subjects were included. A physical examination and a pulmonary function test were performed, and routine blood analyses and vitamin D levels were evaluated. Asthma Control Test was applied. The number of exacerbations in the previous year, asthma therapy, and medication adherence were recorded. Results: In our study, vitamin D levels were below the target values in both patients with asthma (median [minimum-maximum] 16.0 ng/mL [3.5-48 ng/ml]) and control subjects (median [minimum-maximum] 20.0 ng/mL [5.8-58.79 ng/mL]). However, it was lower in the patients with asthma than in the control subjects (p = 0.001). There was a negative relationship between the levels of vitamin D and the severity of asthma (Kendall τ = -0.146; p 0.001). Furthermore, the patients with severe asthma were received The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) step 5 treatment showed significantly lower vitamin D compared with the patients who received GINA step 4 treatment (p = 0.037). Vitamin D levels correlated with forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEV 1 ), and peak expiratory flow (r, 0.221-0.236; p ≤ 0.001). In addition, a positive relationship was found between Asthma Control Test and vitamin D (r = 0.229; p = 0.001). However, body mass index (BMI), asthma exacerbation, and hospitalization were inversely related to vitamin D (r, 0.198-0.233; p = 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that FVC (p = 0.002), FEV 1 (p = 0.033), and BMI (p = 0.037) were independent determinants associated with vitamin D.

However, interventional studies conducted in this regard have shown conflicting results. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in asthmatic patients in improving the degree of control of asthma. Methods: Randomised, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adult asthmatic patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D 3 30 ng/mL. The intervention group received oral supplementation with 16 000 IU of calcifediol per week, and the control group had placebo added to their usual asthma treatment. The study period was 6 months. The primary endpoint was the degree of asthma control as determined by the asthma control test (ACT). Secondary endpoints included quality of life measured using the mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, the number of asthma attacks, oral corticosteroid cycles, the dose of inhaled corticosteroids, number of emergency visits, unscheduled consultations with the primary care physician and hospitalisations for asthma. Results: One hundred and twelve patients were randomised (mean age 55 years, with 87 (78%) being women). Of the 112 patients, 106 (95%) completed the trial. Half the patients (56) were assigned to the intervention group and the other half to the control group. A statistically significant clinical improvement was observed in the intervention group (+3.09) compared with the control group (-0.57) (difference 3.66 (95% CI 0.89 to 5.43); p 0.001) as measured using ACT scores.

146,2021,31278171,Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,vitamin d asthma attacks,1.0,"Introduction: Vitamin D is best known for its role in bone health; however, the discovery of the vitamin D receptor and the expression of the gene encoding the vitamin D 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) enzyme in a wide variety of tissues including immune cells and respiratory epithelium has led to the discovery of potential roles for vitamin D in the prevention of acute wheeze. Methods: We review here the literature concerning the relationships between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration and secondary prevention of acute wheeze attacks in preschool and school-age children. Results: Epidemiological data suggest that vitamin D insufficiency (25(OH)D 75 nmol/L) is highly prevalent in preschool and school-age children with wheeze. Preschool age children with a history of wheeze attacks and circulating 25(OH)D 75 nmol/L are at increased risk and frequency of future acute wheeze. However, no consistent association between low vitamin D status and risk of acute wheeze is reported in school-age children. Seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with relatively small sample sizes (30-430) and variable quality showed inconsistent results regarding the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation during childhood on the risk of asthma attacks, asthma symptom control, inhaled corticosteroid requirements, spirometry and unscheduled healthcare attendances for wheeze. A RCT showed that vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the frequency of unplanned healthcare attendances due to acute wheeze in 22 preschool children. Discussion: An evidence-based recommendation for the use of vitamin D as a preventive therapy for wheeze attacks cannot be made until results of further trials are available. The assessment of circulating 25(OH)D concentration and the optimisation of vitamin D status to prevent acute respiratory tract infections, and to maintain skeletal and general health in preschool and school-age children with acute wheeze is worthwhile in its own right, but whether this will reduce the risk of acute wheeze attacks is unclear."

Aims: This study was performed to explore the possible role of vitamin D on wheezing occurrence among Kuwaiti preschool children. Methods: Out of 244 children from Al-Adan Hospital, Kuwait, 151 cases were enrolled as wheezers while the rest served as controls. The wheezers were subdivided into episodic wheezers (EW) and multiple trigger wheezers (MTW). Detailed history of the wheezing attacks, previous hospitalizations, and intensive care admission were recorded as well as their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. Results: Serum 25(OH)D was significantly lower in the wheezing group, and its decrease was a risk factor for wheezing. Moreover, serum 25(OH)D was not significantly different between EW and MTW; nevertheless, its low level could be linked to MTW. Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of wheezing among preschoolers in Kuwait. A possible link between low serum 25(OH)D and MTW could highlight a specific role for vitamin D in relation to atopy. Prevention and prompt management of vitamin D deficiency should be considered among infants and children with wheezing."

This review summarizes recent advances in the management of asthma in children and adolescents. It focuses on the need for personalized treatment plans based on heterogenous asthma pathophysiology, the use of the terminology 'asthma attack' over exacerbation to instill widespread understanding of severity, and the need for every attack to trigger a structured review and focused strategy. The authors discuss difficulties in diagnosing asthma, accuracy and use of Fractional exhaled nitric oxide both as second line test and as a method to monitor treatment adherence or guide the choice of pharmacotherapy. The authors discuss acute and long-term management of asthma. Asthma treatment goals are to minimize symptom burden, prevent attacks and (where possible) reduce risk and impact of progressive pathophysiology and adverse outcomes. The authors discuss pharmacological management; optimal use of short acting β 2 agonists, long acting muscarinic antagonist (tiotropium), use of which is relatively new in pediatrics, allergen specific immunotherapy, biological monoclonal antibody treatment, azalide antibiotic azithromycin, and the use of vitamin D. They also discuss electronic monitoring and adherence devices, direct observation of therapy via mobile device, temperature controlled laminar airflow device, and the importance of considering when symptoms may actually result from dysfunctional breathing rather than asthma."

We aimed to identify and weight risk factors for asthma attacks in children (5-12 years) in order to inform and prioritise care. Methods: We systematically searched six databases (May 2016; updated with forward citations January 2017) with no language/date restrictions. Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed study quality and extracted data. Heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Weighting was undertaken by an Expert Panel who independently assessed each variable for degree of risk and confidence in the assessment (based on study quality and size, effect sizes, biological plausibility and consistency of results) and then achieved consensus by discussion. Assessments were finally presented, discussed and agreed at a multidisciplinary workshop. Results: From 16 109 records, we included 68 papers (28 cohort; 4 case-control; 36 cross-sectional studies). Previous asthma attacks were associated with greatly increased risk of attack (ORs between 2.0 and 4.1). Persistent symptoms (ORs between 1.4 and 7.8) and poor access to care (ORs between 1.2 and 2.3) were associated with moderately/greatly increased risk. A moderately increased risk was associated with suboptimal drug regimen, comorbid atopic/allergic disease, African-American ethnicity (USA), poverty and vitamin D deficiency. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure, younger age, obesity and low parental education were associated with slightly increased risk. Discussion: Assessment of the clinical and demographic features identified in this review may help clinicians to focus risk reduction management on the high-risk child. Population level factors may be used by health service planners and policymakers to target healthcare initiatives. Trial registration number: CRD42016037464."

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association of innate and adaptive immunity with acute asthma attacks by analysing the role of IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D and cytokines. Material and methods: This prospective study included 33 patients with viral-induced acute asthma and 30 children with controlled asthma. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected for virus identification and asthma attack scores assessed in acute asthma group. Blood sampling for IP-10, TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D levels, and spirometric indices were employed. Results: Serum IP-10 and cathelicidin levels of acute asthma group were significantly higher and vitamin D levels were lower than controlled asthma group (IP-10; p=0.006, cathelicidin; p=0.002, vitamin D; p 0.001). Serum IP-10 levels showed a significant negative correlation with age (p=0.009), TLR2 (p=0.05) and spirometric indices (p=0.002) in all asthmatics and a significant positive correlation with parameters of asthma attack severity (p=0.03) in acute asthma group. Higher cathelicidin values showed significant positive relation to IP-10 (beta coefficient: 33, p=0.02). Serum IP-10 levels higher than 38.9pg/ml (sensitivity: 85%, specificity: 47%, p=0.002) were predictive of virus-induced asthma. Serum IP-10 and vitamin D levels were found to be significantly related to viral-asthma attacks (IP-10; aOR: 8.93, p=0.03 and vitamin D; aOR: 0.82, p=0.001). Conclusions: Innate immunity biomarkers such as serum IP-10 and cathelicidin can be used to predict viral-induced acute asthma. These biomarkers may provide potential new treatment targets for acute asthma."
146,2021,27818797,Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,vitamin d asthma attacks,1.0,"Background . Serum magnesium levels affect the concentration of circulating vitamin D in blood and subsequently it affects the immunity; thus it plays significant role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Asthma, in adults, is less studied and hypomagnesemia along with vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is common in asthmatic individuals, which causes frequent asthma attacks, respiratory infections, severe exacerbations, and poor response to bronchodilators. Objective . To detect the magnitude of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency and serum magnesium levels among asthmatic patients and to correlate them with the severity of asthma. Materials and Methods . This is a cross-sectional case-control study which includes 60 patients of chronic stable asthma and 60 healthy controls. After taking clinical history and systemic examination, pulmonary function test was done. Serum levels of magnesium, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D], and calcium were measured in all the subjects. Results . Significant correlation was found between vitamin D deficiency, hypomagnesemia, and asthma severity. Serum calcium levels were unaffected by that. Conclusion . Vitamin D and serum magnesium deficiency are highly prevalent in patients with asthma. Increased asthma severity, frequency of attacks, and exacerbation are associated with lower levels of one or both. Serum 25(OH)D and magnesium levels may serve as important markers of asthma severity."

The resulting films stored with sweet cherries were analyzed for different physicochemical and antimicrobial properties. Incorporation of ZnO, CaCl 2 , NC, and PEG in chitosan-based films maintained fruit quality by conserving higher total soluble solids, titratable acidity, and reduced weight loss. The combined ZnO + CaCl 2 + NC + PEG in chitosan-based films also suppressed microbial activity. The sensorial quality of fruits stored with CH + ZnO + CaCl 2 + NC + PEG treatment was also stable during storage. In conclusion, the combined CH + ZnO + CaCl 2 + NC + PEG with added thyme oil application is an effective approach to maintain the postharvest quality and could be an alternative to increase the shelf life of sweet cherries, besides decreasing environmental impacts of non-biodegradable packages."
148,2021,35581087,Does chitosan help lose body weight?,chitosan weight loss,0.0,"The present work aims the production of composite bioceramic scaffolds by robocasting suppressing sintering as post printing process. To achieve this purpose, extrudable ink compositions containing a high concentration of bioceramic powders (hydroxyapatite and β-tricalcium phosphate) embedded in aqueous polymeric solutions of chitosan and silk fibroin were fine-tuned. Polymeric solutions of chitosan/silk fibroin with different ratios were tested, maintaining the total amount of bioceramic solids at 30 vol%. The inks were characterized by rheological studies in viscometry and oscillatory modes, being the printable ones selected to produce scaffolds with different macropore sizes (300 μm and 500 μm). The scaffolds were characterized by mechanical properties (dry and wet conditions) and morphological features, as well as its degradability. In vitro studies were also evaluated in the scaffolds that presented the best structural performance. The addition of 2 wt% silk fibroin to a 5 wt% chitosan matrix allows to significantly improve the mechanical performance of the printed composite scaffolds, reflected in high values for Young's modulus and maximum compressive strength. This trend was continued in wet scaffolds with a concomitant reduction of mechanical properties. Regarding degradability, the scaffolds in general presented a weight loss in the range of 14-18% after 28 days incubation in HEPES solution at two different pH values at 37 °C, with an associated release of calcium and phosphorus ions. The scaffold with 300 μm porosity comprising the both polymers in its composition presented the less rate degradation when compared to the scaffolds with similar porosity and containing only chitosan as base matrix. Moreover, the combined natural polymers gave rise to a significant increase in the metabolic activity of human osteoblasts grown on the scaffolds with both macropore' size, being in line with the full cellular filling of their surfaces, demonstrated by SEM and confocal imaging. The advances presented in this work are a promising path in the ink's development for extrusion-based additive manufacturing techniques and subsequent biomaterials, encompassing suitable physical and chemical characteristics with high potential to be used as bone substitutes."

Oxidation causes spoilage and the inedibility of the fruit. However, traditional packaging films without antimicrobial or antioxidant activities do not satisfy the active packaging requirements. Films with antimicrobial and antioxidant activities are urgently required. In this study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized from fruit waste grape seed extracts (GSE). The antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of GSE-silver nanoparticles (GSE-AgNPs) and AgNPs (average size 20 nm) stabilized by polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP-AgNPs) were evaluated in vitro. The effect of chitosan (CS)-coated GSE-AgNPs and PVP-AgNPs on the postharvest quality of grape was studied during storage at 20 °C for 5 days. The results confirmed that grapes treated with CS and GSE-AgNPs showed significantly reduced decay percentage, weight loss, and maintained titratable acidity at high levels compared with those of untreated fruit and fruit treated with PVP-AgNPs. Moreover, CS and GSE-AgNPs significantly inhibited the total mold count during storage. Our results suggest that CS coating enriched with GSE-AgNPs has the potential to preserve the quality and extend the shelf life of grapes."

The new hydrogels were synthesized by crosslinking chitosan with a vanillin isomer, 5-methoxysalicylaldehyde, by a friendly and easy method. To characterize these hydrogels, their structural and morphological properties were explored by FTIR, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, SEM, POM, and TGA. In view of the targeted application, swelling behavior, biodegradability, antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility were investigated in vitro. Structural and morphological studies confirmed the formation of new hydrogels via the imination reaction concomitant with the supramolecular organization. The hydrogels were highly porous with the average pore diameter around 80 μm, and a swelling rate controlled by the crosslinking density and medium pH. The hydrogels showed a progressive weight loss in the presence of lysozyme up to 35%, during 21 days of testing. They proved non-cytotoxic effect on Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts using MTS test and powerful antifungal activity against Candida Albicans, as determined by disk diffusion assay.

148,2021,35037458,Does chitosan help lose body weight?,chitosan weight loss,0.0,"Excessive bleeding in traumatic hemorrhage is the primary concern for natural wound healing and the main reason for trauma deaths. The three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting of bioinks offers the desired structural complexity vital for hemostasis activity and targeted cell proliferation in rapid and controlled wound healing. However, it is challenging to develop suitable bioinks to fabricate specific 3D scaffolds desirable in wound healing. In this work, a 3D composite scaffold is designed using bioprinting technology and synergistic hemostasis mechanisms of cellulose nanofibrils (TCNFs), chitosan, and casein to control blood loss in traumatic hemorrhage. Bioinks that consist of casein bioconjugated TCNF (with a casein content of 104.5 ± 34.1 mg/g) using the carbodiimide cross-linker chemistry were subjected to bioprinting for customizable 3D scaffold fabrication. Further, the 3D composite scaffolds were in situ cross-linked using a green ionic complexation approach. The covalent conjugation among TCNF, casein, and chitosan was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. The in vitro hemostasis activity of the 3D composite scaffold was analyzed by a human thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) assay and adsorption of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets. The 3D composite scaffold had a better swelling behavior and a faster whole blood clotting rate at each time point than the 3D TCNF scaffold and commercial cellulose-based dressings. The TAT assay demonstrated that the 3D composite scaffold could form a higher content of thrombin (663.29 pg/mL) and stable blood clot compared to a cellulosic pad (580.35 pg/mL), 3D TCNF (457.78 pg/mL), and cellulosic gauze (328.92 pg/mL), which are essential for faster blood coagulation. In addition, the 3D composite scaffold had a lower blood clotting index (23.34%) than the 3D TCNF scaffold (41.93%), suggesting higher efficiencies for RBC entrapping to induce blood clotting. The in vivo cytocompatibility was evaluated by a 3D cell culture study, and results showed that the 3D composite scaffold could promote growth and proliferation of NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells, which is vital for wound healing. Cellulase-based in vitro deconstruction of the 3D composite scaffold showed significant weight loss (80 ± 5%) compared to the lysozyme hydrolysis (22 ± 5%) after 28 days of incubation, suggesting the biodegradation potential of the composite scaffold. In conclusion, this study proposes efficient prospects to develop a 3D composite scaffold from bioprinting of TCNF-based bioinks that can accelerate blood clotting and wound healing, suggesting its potential application in reducing blood loss during traumatic hemorrhage."

Consequently, the continuous demand for more effective, safe and acceptable therapies for reducing body weight is also escalating-including complementary and alternative therapies (CATs). The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the most commonly- and recently-used CATs, with evaluation of their safety and efficacy for weight loss. Electronic scientific databases such as Scopus, PubMed and EBSCO Host were explored for articles that reported CATs for overweight and obesity treatment from 2015 to December 2019. Only systematic reviews, meta-analysis and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English were included. Studies whereby CATs were not utilized for reducing body weight were excluded. Eight systematic reviews and meta-analyses and 11 additional RCTs with 765 participants (50.2% overweight and 49.8% obese) related to hypnotherapy, acupuncture and dietary supplements met the inclusion criteria. Their results suggested that spirulina, chitosan, probiotic, EPA + DHA, vitamin D, fiber, and herbal extract supplementation may all provide small reductions in body weight (ranging from 1-10 kg). Interestingly, hypnotherapy and acupuncture reported significantly greater reduction in body weight compared with placebo (p 0.001 and p 0.0001, respectively). Nonetheless, the evidence is still relatively limited and not encouraging to provide a definitive conclusion due to the methodological shortcomings and the presence of adverse events in chitosan and fiber supplementation. Hence, studies of this nature need to be further replicated and improved to corroborate the efficacy and safety of the CATs to combat weight issues."

Its use as a dietary supplement for weight loss derives from its purported ability to bind negatively charged lipids and bile acids and prevent their gastrointestinal absorption. Here, we report the case of a dialysis patient who did not tolerate prescription phosphorus binders and who has been able to control her serum phosphorus levels for a year by taking 3.5 g of chitosan a day with meals. A quantitative analysis shows that chitosan may bind between 16 and 41 mg of phosphorus per gram, comparable to prescription binders. Chitosan may provide an over-the-counter alternative as non-calcium phosphorus binder for patients not tolerating prescription phosphorus binders because of side effects, cost, or efforts to limit their medication burden."

Keeping this in view, the present study was designed to investigate the possible protective effects of normal vitamin C and E and vitamin C and E nanoparticles (embedded in chitosan) against cisplatin-induced reproductive toxicities. Vitamins C, E, and their nanoparticles in this regard proved to be an effective therapy. The work aimed to treat cisplatin-induced reproductive toxicities through vitamin C and E and their nanoparticles. Cisplatin exposure caused significant reduction in the weight, testosterone level, and changed lipid profile. Similarly, cisplatin induced significant widespread testicular atrophy and testicular lesions as evidenced by the gaps in the epithelium and loss of differentiating germ cells. Vitamin C and E and their nanoparticles rescued the weight, testosterone level, and testicular disturbances, which is associated with improved histological view of testicular tissues. The current study highlights evidence that designing a medication of vitamin C and E nanoparticles is useful in mitigating cisplatin-induced reproductive toxicity in cancerous male patients underlying chemotherapy."

Subjects/methods: Four electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cinahl) were searched until December 2019. Sixty-seven randomised placebo-controlled trials of dietary supplements containing isolated organic compounds for weight loss were included. Meta-analyses were conducted for chitosan, glucomannan, conjugated linoleic acid and fructans, comparing mean weight difference post-intervention between participants receiving the dietary supplement or placebo. Results: Statistically significant weight differences compared to placebo were observed for chitosan (-1.84 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.79, -0.88; p 0.01), glucomannan (-1.27 kg; 95%CI -2.45, -0.09; p = 0.04), and conjugated linoleic acid (-1.08 kg; 95%CI -1.61, -0.55; p 0.01). None met our threshold for clinical significance (≥2.5 kg). There was no statistically significant effect on weight for fructans compared to placebo (p = 0.24). For dietary supplements with an inadequate number of trials for meta-analysis, a statistically and borderline clinically significant weight difference compared to placebo was found for modified cellulose, manno-oligosaccharides (in males), blood orange juice extract, and three multiple-ingredient dietary supplements. These were only reported in one trial of each. Thus, more evidence is needed before recommending them for weight loss. Conclusions: While some dietary supplements containing isolated organic compounds warrant further investigation to determine efficacy and safety, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend any of these dietary supplements for weight loss."

Material and Methods We included randomized controlled trials on PCOS patients undergoing administration of nutraceuticals, in particular vitamin D, vitamin E, probiotics, and inositols. These administrations are variable in terms of dosage, single supplementation, or combined with other compounds, dosage, and duration of the intervention. Results The supplementation of inositols, at the physiologic ratio of 40: 1 of myo- and D-chiro-inositols, resulted to be the most effective in improving the glucose homeostasis and fertility, with a restoration of ovulatory capacity and menstrual regularity. Other nutraceuticals are particularly effective in reducing hyperandrogenism, with promising results demonstrated by the combinations of vitamin D and probiotics, vitamin E and coenzyme Q10, and the enrichment of inositol therapy with group B vitamins. An improvement in the inflammatory status and antioxidant capacity is obtained with the co-supplementation of probiotics and selenium or with vitamin E combined with omega 3. Conclusions Inositol supplementation is effective in the treatment of insulin resistance and fertility. Probiotics reduced hyperandrogenism, inflammatory and oxidative conditions, and resulted more effective when combined with selenium.

Many patients with male infertility are caused by a reduced antioxidant capacity of semen. Several antioxidant supplements, especially vitamin E, are proposed to help male infertility treatment. This project was goaled to study the effects of oral synthetic vitamin E (400 IU/day) for eight weeks on betterment of semen parameters and pregnancy rate. Methods: After dropping the cases, 124 infertile couples with a male factor who were admitted to the IVF program were included. The male patients with idiopathic abnormal motility and/or morphology were randomized into two groups: 61 receiving vitamin E and 63 as the control group receiving placebo for eight weeks. The pretreatment semen parameters of both groups were compared with those of posttreatment. The pregnancy outcomes were considered between the two groups. Results: There were no significant differences statistically between before and after treatment in the term of sperm volume, count, motility, and morphology. Furthermore, the IVF outcomes of the two groups were not different significantly, either. Interestingly, the percent of normal sperm in the placebo group was significantly decreased after eight weeks. Conclusion: Vitamin E supplementation might neutralize free radical activity to keep sperm from more oxidative damages. Further studies regarding the influence of higher acceptable doses of vitamin E on semen characteristics and fertility rates are needed.

However, oxidative stress has been recognized as one of the main mediators of female infertility by causing various reproductive pathologies in females such as endometriosis, PCOS, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, and unexplained infertility. Nowadays, concerned women prefer dietary supplements with antioxidant properties over synthetic drugs as a natural way to lessen the oxidative stress and enhance their fertility. Therefore, the current review is an attempt to explore the efficacy of various natural antioxidant compounds including vitamins, carotenoids, and plant polyphenols and also of some medicinal plants in improving the fertility status of females. Our summarization of recent findings in the current article would pave the way toward the development of new possible antioxidant therapy to treat infertility in females. Natural antioxidant compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and other dietary sources, alone or in combination with other antioxidants, were found to be effective in ameliorating the oxidative stress-mediated infertility problems in both natural and assisted reproductive settings. Numerous medicinal plants showed promising results in averting the various reproductive disorders associated with female infertility, suggesting a plant-based herbal medicine to treat infertility. Although optimum levels of natural antioxidants have shown favorable results, however, their excessive intake may have adverse health impacts. Therefore, larger well-designed, dose-response studies in humans are further warranted to incorporate natural antioxidant compounds into the clinical management of female infertility."

Concerned women look for dietary supplements with antioxidant properties advertised as a natural way to increase fertility. Curcumin (CUR) is a polyphenol with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. CUR elicits apoptotic cell death as evidenced in some tumor cells. In this work, the effect of CUR on granulosa cells (GC) was studied. GC surround the oocyte, providing nutrient exchange and hormone production, necessary for its development. COV434 cell line and primary human granulosa cells (hGC) cultures from patients undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) were used. GC were treated with CUR (0.001-50 μM) at different times (24-72 h). Low concentrations of CUR showed an increase on cell viability. Likewise, it leads to a decrease in ROS/RNS formation after stress induction, suggesting a protective role. Changes in hormonal levels were not observed. In contrast, high concentrations of CUR triggered a reduction on cell viability and a programmed cell death mechanism. Allied to the above results, high doses of CUR affected hormonal function of GCs. Our work reinforces the benefits of dietary supplements, namely CUR, on the main functions of GC and, consequently, on reproductive success."

There is extensive evidence highlighting the role of oxidative stress in male infertility due to elevated levels of sperm DNA fragmentation and abnormal semen parameters. The use of antioxidants is a potential therapeutic option to reduce ROS and improve semen quality. The appeal is that antioxidants can be easily obtained over the counter and are considered all-natural and therefore healthy. The hypothesis has been that by decreasing oxidative stress, antioxidants may be used for the treatment of male infertility.

Approximately, 40%- 50% of male infertility cases in general and up to 80% in men with idiopathic infertility cases are caused by oxidative stress and decreased level of seminal total antioxidant capacity. Objective: To investigate the beneficial effects of micronutrient supplementation on sperm concentration, motility and morphology. Methods: A PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase data, Web of Science and Cochrane Library database extensive research of the randomized controlled studies utilizing micronutrient vitamins and supplements was performed. Results: The existent international literature is rather heterogeneous and a definitive is difficult to be drawn. Several micronutrients have beneficial effects on sperm parameters. Rational use of micronutrients might be helpful for infertile patients. Conclusion: Further randomized, controlled clinical trials are required to elucidate the efficacy and safety of micronutrients and propose proper protocols for their use. A well-rounded, balanced diet is more preferable than the widespread use of micronutrient supplements beyond the recommended doses. Future studies should concern the pregnancy rate as a primary outcome in their designs. Further research should be done to determine the appropriate antioxidant compounds, the duration of the treatment, as well as a certain dose of antioxidants in clinical practices. The pre-treatment evaluation of the seminal oxidative status is also an important parameter to proceed with micronutrient supplementation without the risk of reductive stress. Under these conditions, supplements could support the quality of sperm and help to alleviate male infertility."

Objective: Theoretically, antioxidant supplementation may act as a protection system against free radicals. Since infertile males have higher levels of ROS, nutritional supplements are widely used for protecting sperms. In the recent review, the authors summarize the most recent data regarding the effect of antioxidant treatment and draw the attention of the limitations of antioxidant use in male infertility. Methods: The recent review gives an update of antioxidant treatment in male infertility. Results: Improvement of sperm parameters was reported in the majority of studies. Comparing different antioxidants versus placebo showed low certainty of evidence with a serious risk of bias, and there is a lack regarding certain doses, pregnancy rate, and live birth rate outcomes. Various clinical studies and randomized control trials reported negative outcomes. Conflicting findings lead the attention to the study of biochemical features of the oxidant vs. antioxidant equilibrium. Higher exposure to antioxidants will result in ""reductive stress"", which has harmful effects on sperm function, moreover can negatively influence embryo development. Reductive stress is as dangerous as oxidative stress and may act as a cause of different human pathologies. Conclusion: An intact balance of oxidant and antioxidant systems is required for normal sperm function. No guideline exists for the antioxidant dose regimen and treatment duration. Overdosing can result in reductive stress, which is also harmful to fertility and can cause several diseases. Assessment of the pre-treatment redox status can be recommended before the administration of exogenous antioxidants."

Antioxidant supplements, therefore, represent a logical therapeutic approach, although the recent Cochrane review recommends cautious interpretation of publications and findings to date. This commentary considers whether male fertility supplements have a place in current reproductive medicine practice. Importantly, although sperm selection for intracytoplasmic sperm injection is a common research theme, survey data show that men would prefer medication to achieve natural conception, rather than treatment to improve assisted reproductive technology (ART) success. A total of 27.1% (n = 112), 26.6% (n = 110) and 24.5% (n = 101) respondents indicated they (or their male partner) would undertake medical treatment to attempt natural conception for up to 6 months, 12 months and 2 years, respectively. A total of 63% indicated that they would be prepared to participate in a clinical trial and 57% would defer ART by 6 months to do so.

We combined, for the first time, research on macromolecular and low-molecular-weight compounds of latex-bearing plants in contrast to other studies that investigated proteins and alkaloids separately. The observed interaction between latex protein and alkaloids may influence our knowledge on plant defense. The proposed toolbox may help in further understanding of plant disease resistance and in pharmacological research."

We examined food-based dietary intake in pregnant women with and without HIV at first antenatal care (ANC) visit, and associations with maternal overweight/obesity and gestational weight gain (GWG). Methods: In an urban South African community, consecutive women living with (n = 479) and without (n = 510) HIV were enrolled and prospectively followed to delivery. Interviewer-administered non-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake (starch, protein, dairy, fruits, vegetables, legumes, oils/fats) at enrolment. Associations with maternal body mass index (BMI) and GWG were examined using logistic regression models. Results: Among women (median age 29 years, IQR 25-34), the prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) at first ANC was 43% and that of excessive GWG (per IOM guidelines) was 37% overall; HIV prevalence was 48%. In women without HIV, consumption of potato (any preparation) (aOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.02-3.84) and pumpkin/butternut (aOR 2.13, 95% CI 1.29-3.49) for 1-3 days a week increased the odds of overweight/obesity compared to not consuming any; milk in tea/coffee (aOR 6.04, 95% CI 1.37-26.50) increased the odds of excessive GWG. Consumption of eggs (any) (aOR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32-0.86) for 1-3 days a week reduced the odds of overweight/obesity while peanut and nuts consumption for 4-7 days a week reduced the odds (aOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.80) of excessive GWG. In women with HIV, consumption of milk/yoghurt/maas to drink/on cereals (aOR 0.35, 95% CI 0.18-0.68), tomato (raw/cooked) (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30-0.84), green beans (aOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.86), mixed vegetables (aOR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29-0.84) and legumes e.g. baked beans, lentils (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.86) for 4-7 days a week reduced the odds of overweight/obesity; tomato (raw/cooked) (aOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.96) and mixed vegetables (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.78) also reduced the odds of excessive GWG. Conclusions: Diet modification may promote healthy weight in pregnant women living with and without HIV."

Data regarding the association of caffeine intake and stillbirth are varied. We aimed to investigate the degree of consumption of caffeinated drinks or soft drinks in the last four weeks of pregnancy in women who experienced a late stillbirth compared to women with ongoing live pregnancies at similar gestation. Influences on maternal caffeine intake and soft drink consumption during pregnancy were also investigated. Study design: A case-control study undertaken in 41 maternity units in the United Kingdom. Cases were women who had a singleton non-anomalous stillbirth ≥28 weeks' gestation (n = 290) and controls were women with an ongoing pregnancy at the time of interview (n = 729). Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire which included questions regarding consumption of a variety of caffeinated drinks and soft drinks in the last four weeks of pregnancy as well as other behaviours (e.g. cigarette smoking). Results: Multivariable analysis adjusting for co-existing demographic and behavioural factors found the consumption of instant coffee, energy drinks and cola were associated with increased risk of stillbirth. There was an independent association between caffeine intake and late stillbirth (adjusted Odds Ratio 1.27, 95 % Confidence Interval (95 %CI) 1.14, 1.43 for each 100 mg increment/day). 15 % of cases and 8% of controls consumed more than the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendation (&gt;300 mg of caffeine/day; aOR 2.30, 95 % CI 1.40, 4.24). The population attributable risk for stillbirth associated with &gt;300 mg of caffeine/day was 7.4 %. The majority of respondents reduced caffeine consumption in pregnancy. Midwives and internet resources were the most frequently used sources of information which influenced maternal behaviour with regard to soft drinks and caffeine, and this did not differ between cases and controls. Conclusions: Women should be informed that consumption of caffeine during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of stillbirth, particularly at levels greater than recommended by the WHO (&gt;300 mg/day). Recommendations from midwives and internet-based resources are likely to be the most effective means to influence maternal behaviour."

Maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy may have adverse effects on foetus but results are conflicting. Our goals were to estimate the prevalence of caffeine use in a cohort of French pregnant women using maternal self-reports and to evaluate the association between caffeine consumption during pregnancy and delivery and newborn characteristics. All pregnant women who gave birth in a large French urban area during a limited period of time were included (in total 724 mothers were included). Coffee, tea or cola consumption as well as pregnancy and neonate characteristics were analysed. The mean consumption of caffeine per day slightly decreased from the first to the third trimester of pregnancy: 587 caffeine users, with a consumption of caffeine of 59.2 ± 61.5 mg/day during the first trimester as compared to 577 consumers (54.3 ± 55.4 mg/day) during the third trimester, respectively. A significant decrease of neonates' birth length was observed when mothers were using at least 100 mg/day (or two cups) of caffeine during the second and third trimesters but this difference was no longer significant after adjustment on potential confounding factors such as tobacco use. The potential existence of other confounders (e.g. poorer dietary habits or other lifestyle variables) that might also be associated with reduced birth length, may not be excluded. Caffeine use during pregnancy was associated with reduced birth length but this effect was no longer significant after adjustment on potential confounding variables."

We performed a parallel group, randomised non-inferiority trial, comparing gastric emptying of 450 ml isocalorically-adjusted maltodextrin, coffee with milk or pulp-free orange juice, with 18 women in each group. The women were initially fasted for 2 h for clear fluids, 6 h for a light meal and 8 h for a high fat or high protein meal. We performed gastric ultrasound in the semirecumbent-right lateral decubitus position. Gastric antral area was measured at baseline and at 5 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min. Gastric emptying of maltodextrin was significantly faster than coffee with milk (p 0.001) and orange juice (p 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between pulp-free orange juice and coffee with milk (p = 0.97). The estimated gastric residual volume was lower than baseline from 90 min after drinking maltodextrin. In labouring women, maltodextrin is cleared from the stomach faster than coffee with milk and orange juice. Gastric emptying depends on other factors besides the caloric load and volume of the drink."

Data was collected interviewing a representative sample of 1150 pregnant women. The mean and median TTPs were 6.4 (±9.4) and 3.0 months respectively. Only 11.8% (136/1,150) achieved pregnancy in the first month of attempt. Majority, 81.7% (938/1,150), achieved pregnancy by 12 months. The odds of sub-fecundity (TTP more than 12 months) was lowest in age group of 25-29 years (AOR 0.37; 95% CI 0.20-0.70).

Design: Cross-sectional design. Participants answered an FFQ at inclusion into a randomized controlled trial, the Fit for Delivery (FFD) trial, in median gestational week 15 (range: 9-20), reporting current consumption and in retrospect how often they drank the different beverages pre-pregnancy. Setting: Eight local antenatal clinics in southern Norway from September 2009 to February 2013. Subjects: Five hundred and seventy-five healthy pregnant nulliparous women. Results: Pre-pregnancy, 27 % reported drinking alcohol at least once weekly, compared with none in early pregnancy (P 0.001). The percentage of women drinking coffee (38 % v. 10 %, P 0.001), sugar-sweetened beverages (10 % v. 6 %, P=0.011) and artificially sweetened beverages (12 % v. 9 %, P=0.001) at least daily decreased significantly from pre-pregnancy to early pregnancy, while the percentage of women who reported to drink water (85 % v. 92 %, P 0.001), fruit juice (14 % v. 20 %, P=0.001) and milk (37 % v. 42 %, P=0.001) at least daily increased significantly. From pre-pregnancy to early pregnancy higher educated women reduced their consumption frequency of coffee significantly more than women with lower education. Older women reduced their consumption frequency of coffee and artificially sweetened beverages and increased their consumption frequency of fruit juice and milk significantly more than younger women.

Methods: A total of 177 Malay pregnant women participated in the validation study while 85 of them participated in the reproducibility study which was carried out in the antenatal clinic of Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital. The newly developed FFQ was validated against two 24-hour dietary recalls (DR). The FFQ was repeated 20 to 28 days apart. Results: Results showed that the FFQ moderately over-estimated the nutrient and food intakes compared to the DR. Spearman correlation coefficients for nutrients ranged from 0.24 (fat) to 0.61 (calcium) and for foods, ranged from 0.13 (organ meats, onion and garlic) to 0.57 (malt drink). For nutrients, 72 to 85% of women were classified into the correct quartiles from the FFQ and the DR while for foods, 67 to 85% of women were classified correctly. Bland-Altman plot showed relatively good agreement between these two dietary methods. The intra-class correlation (ICC) was used to estimate reproducibility. It ranged from 0.75 (vitamin C) to 0.94 (phosphorus) for nutrients while it ranged from 0.73 (confectionary) to 0.96 (coffee) for foods. Conclusion: On average, at least 90% of pregnant women were correctly classified into the quartiles for nutrients and foods from the two sets of the FFQ. The FFQ presented acceptable reproducibility and appears to be a valid tool for categorising pregnant women according to dietary intake."

A systematic search was conducted in electronic databases to identify trials published between 1950 and late 2009 concerned with preoperative fasting, early resumption of oral intake and the effects of oral carbohydrate mixtures on gastric emptying and postoperative recovery. One study on preoperative fasting which had not been included in previous reviews and a further 13 studies published since the most recent review were identified. The searches also identified 20 potentially relevant studies of oral carbohydrates and 53 on early resumption of oral intake. Publications were classified in terms of their evidence level, scientific validity and clinical relevance. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network scoring system for assessing level of evidence and grade of recommendations was used. The key recommendations are that adults and children should be encouraged to drink clear fluids up to 2 h before elective surgery (including caesarean section) and all but one member of the guidelines group consider that tea or coffee with milk added (up to about one fifth of the total volume) are still clear fluids. Solid food should be prohibited for 6 h before elective surgery in adults and children, although patients should not have their operation cancelled or delayed just because they are chewing gum, sucking a boiled sweet or smoking immediately prior to induction of anaesthesia. These recommendations also apply to patients with obesity, gastro-oesophageal reflux and diabetes and pregnant women not in labour. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of antacids, metoclopramide or H2-receptor antagonists before elective surgery in non-obstetric patients, but an H2-receptor antagonist should be given before elective caesarean section, with an intravenous H2-receptor antagonist given prior to emergency caesarean section, supplemented with 30 ml of 0.3 mol l(-1) sodium citrate if general anaesthesia is planned. Infants should be fed before elective surgery. Breast milk is safe up to 4 h and other milks up to 6 h. Thereafter, clear fluids should be given as in adults. The guidelines also consider the safety and possible benefits of preoperative carbohydrates and offer advice on the postoperative resumption of oral intake."

Methods: it is a cross-sectional study performed between 2005 and 2007. The present analysis refers to the period among the 8th and 13th gestational week and included 255 pregnant women from 18 to 40 years, clients of a municipal health center in Rio de Janeiro. The outcome variable was caffeine consumption, quantified by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, which count with a list containing 81 items and eight options of consumption frequencies; besides it being previously validated in a sample of employees of the State University of Rio de Janeiro. The caffeine intake was quantified starting from the consumption of: powdered chocolate, chocolate bar or chocolate, soft drink, coffee and mate tea. The statistical analysis was performed by means of fitting a multivariate linear regression. Results: the median and the mean caffeine consumption were, respectively, 97.5 and 121.1 mg (standard deviation, sd = 128.4). The high caffeine consumption (&gt; 300 mg/day) was observed in 8.3% of pregnant women. It was observed in the multivariate model that women with earlier menarche (beta = -0.15), with more household partners (b = 0.17) and who didn't make use of medicines (beta = -0.24) presented larger tendency to high caffeine consumption association that was statistically significant (p 0.05). Conclusions: the caffeine consumption for most of the pregnant women was inferior to the limit of 300 mg/day as committed in other studies.

Design and methods: A validated quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used in this study. Trained fieldworkers conducted interviews with the help of food models to estimate portion sizes. The anthropometric measurements included weight, height and body mass index (BMI). Blood samples were collected for determining iron status parameters. Results: The 10 items consumed most frequently by pregnant women were, in descending order: fresh milk; tea; coffee; cold drinks; maize meal; fruit juice; bread; magou (non-alcoholic fermented maize drink); rice and sugar. For lactating women, the results were: fresh milk; tea; coffee; maize meal; cold drinks; magou; bread; yoghurt; rice and sugar. Daily intakes (mean +/- SD) for pregnant women were 8425.71 +/- 2279 kJ, 73.18 +/- 23 g protein, 62.29 +/- 23.7 g fat, 292.45 +/- 72.2 g carbohydrate and 9.74 +/- 3.8 mg iron. For lactating women, the intakes were 8511.94 +/- 2047 kJ, 76.24 +/- 25 g protein, 61.95 +/- 22.3 g fat, 294.37 +/- 64.2 g carbohydrate and 10.50 +/- 4.0 mg iron. The results of this study showed that most of the women (98%) resided in towns and 79.3% were unemployed. The majority of the sample population was overweight or obese (BMI&gt; or = 25). Conclusions: The diets of the subjects consisted primarily of plant-based foods. Animal foods were scarce except for milk. Most of the items consumed were low in iron. Implications: Iron deficiency is partly induced by plant-based diets containing low levels of poorly bio-available iron. An assessment of dietary intake is required to aid in the development of relevant dietary guidelines for the sample population."

Epidemiological studies revealed that intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and cereals could reduce the risk of CVDs, and their antioxidants are considered as the main contributors. Moreover, experimental studies showed that some antioxidant natural products and their bioactive compounds exerted beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, such as polyphenols, polysaccharides, anthocyanins, epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, rutin, and puerarin. The mechanisms of action mainly included reducing blood pressure, improving lipid profile, ameliorating oxidative stress, mitigating inflammation, and regulating gut microbiota. Furthermore, clinical trials confirmed the cardiovascular-protective effect of some antioxidant natural products, such as soursop, beetroot, garlic, almond, and green tea. In this review, we summarized the effects of some antioxidant natural products and their bioactive compounds on CVDs based on the epidemiological, experimental, and clinical studies, with special attention paid to the relevant mechanisms and clinical trials."

We have thus aimed to isolate the randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of black or green tea as a beverage in subjects with elevated blood pressure (BP), or HTN. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest dissertations and theses databases were searched from February 1, 1995, up to July 20, 2019, to identify relevant studies. Results: The search strategy generated 1119 trials, of which finally five trials fulfilled the criteria for being included in the current study. Three out of 5 articles showed a low risk of bias. According to nine measurements derived from 5 trials on 408 individuals, it was found that regular tea intake resulted in the reduction in SBP (weighted mean difference (WMD): -4.81 mmHg, 95 %CI: -8.40 to -1.58, P = .004) and DBP (WMD:-1.98 mmHg, 95 %CI: -3.77 to -0.20, P = .029); however, excluding the most heterogeneous trials showed that regular tea intake might reduce SBP and DBP by about -3.53 and -0.99 mmHg, respectively. Based on meta-regression findings, we found the longer the duration of tea intake (≥3months), the higher the decrease in both SBP and DBP. Categorized studies, according to the tea type, revealed that the hypotensive effects of green tea were more pronounced compared to black tea. None of the studies reported any side effects. Conclusion: These results suggest the positive effects of regular tea intake on BP in subjects with elevated BP or HTN. Hence, it may be applicable to physicians, health care providers, and particularly HTN patients."

Data were pooled from six human trials (n=921, 505 men) comparing the effects of GTC-containing beverages (540-588 mg GTC/beverage) and a placebo beverage. Outcome measures were abdominal fat [total fat area (TFA), visceral fat area (VFA), subcutaneous fat area (SFA)], and MetS risk. We estimated mean changes from baseline and calculated confidence intervals (CI) to assess reductions in abdominal fat accumulation and MetS improvement. Subclass analyses were performed by classifying subjects as Pre-MetS or MetS at trial initiation. Additional subclass analyses were performed with Pre-MetS and MetS subjects further stratified according to whether GTC intake reduced TFA, VFA, or SFA. Consumption of GTC-containing beverages for 12 weeks significantly reduced TFA (-17.7cm<sup>2</sup>, 95%CI: -20.9 to -14.4), VFA (-7.5cm<sup>2</sup>, 95%CI: -9.3 to -5.7), SFA (-10.2cm<sup>2</sup>, 95%CI: -12.5 to -7.8), body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference; and improved blood pressure. Subclass analyses of Pre-MetS and MetS subjects showed improved MetS in the GTC group [odds ratio (OR), 1.67; 95%CI: 1.08-2.57]. The ORs for improved MetS in the TFA- and VFA-reduced groups were 2.79 (95%CI: 1.28-6.09) and 4.36 (95%CI: 2.03-9.39), respectively. Continual consumption of GTC-containing beverages reduced abdominal fat and improved MetS, suggesting its potential to prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Additional large-scale intervention trials are needed to evaluate the effects of GTC on the risk of MetS in high-risk populations."

Prevention is known to be the cornerstone to lessen the incidence of CVDs and also to reduce the economic burden of both the citizen and the healthcare system. ""Interventional medicine"" certainly puts lifestyle modification as the first therapeutic step, including a healthy diet and physical activity. Secondly, a large body of research individuated a number of food and plant bioactives, which are potentially efficacious in preventing and reducing some highly prevalent CV risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, vascular inflammation and vascular compliance. Some lipid- and blood pressure-lowering bioactives were studied for their impact on human vascular health, particularly as regards endothelial function and arterial stiffness. Several nutraceuticals showed additive or synergistic properties in combination, sometimes (but not always) allowing a reduction of the administered dose of extracts and determining a ""multi-factorial"" final effect on many cardiovascular risk factors. Thus, this review focuses on available evidence regarding the effects of berberine, plant sterols, green tea extract, soy, curcumin, cocoa, pycnogenol, lycopene, olive oil, soluble fibers, garlic, resveratrol, beetroot, mineral salts and vitamins on the lipid profile, blood pressure, inflammatory and endothelial markers, and vascular compliance.

The laminar shear stress is a common test used usually as the flow mediated dilatation test (FMD) which is sensitive to saturated fat, sodium and potassium although with the latter ion it is possible potassium has direct effects on ion channels in the smooth muscle cell as well as the endothelial cell. High blood pressure and blood cholesterol both reduce nitric oxide production, the latter probably by increasing caveolin-1 which binds nitric oxide synthase. Saturated fat reduces nitric oxide by elevating LDL cholesterol and caveolin-1 while insulin stimulates nitric oxide synthase activity by serine phosphorylation. Polyphenols from tea, coffee and cocoa and virgin olive oil enhance FMD and eNOS activity is essential for this activity. Wine polyphenols produce mixed results and it is not clear at present that they are beneficial. Blackberries and other polyphenol-rich fruit also enhance FMD. Dietary nitrate from beetroot and green leafy vegetables is converted to nitrite by salivary microbes and then to nitric oxide and this acts directly on the smooth muscle to lower blood pressure particularly in a low oxygen environment. Dietary nitrate also improves work efficiency and improves flow mediated dilatation."

In more recent years, numerous studies have investigated the possible BP-lowering effect of different nutraceuticals; these range from specific foods to minerals, lipids, whole proteins, peptides, amino acids, probiotics, and vitamins. While a very large body of evidence supports the use of potassium, L-arginine, vitamins C and D, cocoa flavonoids, beetroot juice, some probiotics, coenzyme Q10, controlled-release melatonin, aged garlic extract, and coffee, the use of other nutraceuticals, such as green tea, flaxseed, and resveratrol, has not as yet been supported by adequate evidence. In some cases, e.g. proteins/peptides, the responsible component needs also to be fully uncovered. Finally, while for most of the products only short-term studies are available, with no specific end-points, an ongoing very large prospective study on chocolate flavanols will answer the question whether this may reduce cardiovascular risk. Thus, in addition to data on long-term safety, further clinical research is advisable in order to identify, among active nutraceuticals, those with the best cost-effectiveness and risk-benefit ratio for a wide use in the general population with a raised cardiovascular risk consequent to uncomplicated hypertension."

We hypothesized that a combination of extracts from grape seed and skin (330 mg), green tea (100 mg), resveratrol (60 mg) and a blend of quercetin, ginkgo biloba and bilberry (60 mg) would reduce blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive subjects. Subjects/methods: Eighteen individuals meeting BP requirements (⩾130 mm Hg systolic or ⩾85 mm Hg diastolic) and criteria for metabolic syndrome were enrolled in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, <a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01106170"" title=""See in ClinicalTrials.gov"">NCT01106170</a>). The 28-day placebo and supplement arms were separated by a 2-week washout period, and 14 -h daytime ambulatory BP was assessed at baseline and at the end point of each arm. Results: BP was not altered after placebo. After supplement treatment, diastolic pressure was reduced by 4.4 mm Hg (P=0.024, 95% CI, 0.6-8.1), systolic pressure was unchanged and mean arterial pressure trended (P=0.052) toward reduction. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was similar between placebo and supplement arms, but urinary nitrate and nitrite concentrations were significantly increased (P=0.022) after supplementation. Human aortic endothelial cells treated with metabolites of the polyphenols used in the human supplement trial had a significant increase (P=0.005) in insulin-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation and greater (P 0.001) accumulation of nitrates/nitrites. Conclusions: Our clinical and in vitro data support the theory that this combination of polyphenols reduced diastolic pressure by potentiating eNOS activation and nitric oxide production. Such supplements may have clinical relevance as stand-alone or adjunct therapy to help reduce BP."

Objective: The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of tea on blood pressure in individuals within the prehypertensive and hypertensive blood pressure ranges. Data sources: The CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched for all relevant studies published from 1946 to September 27, 2013. Study selection: The selection criteria included randomized controlled trials of adults whose blood pressure was within hypertensive or prehypertensive ranges and in which the applied intervention was green or black tea; controls consisting of placebo, minimal tea intervention, or no intervention; and a follow-up period of at least 2 months. Data extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted data on participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study design. Mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were pooled to generate summary effect estimates. Results: Meta-analyses of 10 trials (834 participants) showed statistically significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (MD -2.36 mmHg, 95%CI -4.20 to -0.52) and diastolic blood pressure (MD -1.77 mmHg, 95%CI -3.03 to -0.52) with tea consumption. Conclusions: Consumption of green or black tea can reduce blood pressure in individuals within prehypertensive and hypertensive ranges, although further investigation with studies of longer duration and stronger methodological quality is warranted to confirm these findings."

Singaporean Chinese residents aged ⩾40 years were randomly selected and interviewed face-to-face by clinical research assistants. Hypertension was defined as measured systolic blood pressure at least 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure at least 90 mmHg or self-reported history/treatment for hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension among the whole investigated population (N=1184, 58.27% females) was 49.73% and the prevalence increased to 66.47% in the sub-population aged ⩾60 years. High risk of hypertension was associated with age ⩾60 years (odds ratio (OR): 4.15-4.19, P 0.01), obesity (body mass index &gt;25 kg m(-2), OR: 2.10-2.11, P 0.01), family history of hypertension (OR: 2.69-2.76, P 0.01), diabetes history (OR: 2.29-2.33, P 0.01), hyperlipidemia history (OR: 1.79-1.80, P 0.01), male (OR: 1.56-1.59, P 0.01) and coffee intake (OR: 1.44-1.46, P 0.05). In contrast, drinking green tea at least 150 ml per week was associated with lower hypertension risk (OR: 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.43-0.91, P 0.05). Drinking combination of green tea and British tea was associated with higher reduction in the risk of hypertension (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.39-0.85, P 0.05). This cross-sectional study suggests that consumption of tea, especially green tea and British tea, was associated with lowering the risk of hypertension. On the other hand, consumption of coffee could be a risk factor of hypertension. These findings may provide useful information for health promotion to reduce risk of hypertension and warrant further study to confirm and elucidate such association."

Recent studies have shown the role of dietary polyphenols in the prevention of obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases. Here, we evaluated the impact of commonly consumed polyphenols, including green tea catechins, especially epigallocatechin gallates, resveratrol and curcumin, on obesity and obesity-related inflammation. Cellular studies demonstrated that these dietary polyphenols reduce viability of adipocytes and proliferation of preadipocytes, suppress adipocyte differentiation and triglyceride accumulation, stimulate lipolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation, and reduce inflammation. Concomitantly, the polyphenols modulate signaling pathways including the adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α, peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma activator 1-alpha, sirtuin 1, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, uncoupling proteins 1 and 2, and nuclear factor-κB that regulate adipogenesis, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses. Animal studies strongly suggest that commonly consumed polyphenols described in this review have a pronounced effect on obesity as shown by lower body weight, fat mass and triglycerides through enhancing energy expenditure and fat utilization, and modulating glucose hemostasis. Limited human studies have been conducted in this area and are inconsistent about the antiobesity impact of dietary polyphenols probably due to the various study designs and lengths, variation among subjects (age, gender, ethnicity), chemical forms of the dietary polyphenols used and confounding factors such as other weight-reducing agents. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to reconcile the discrepancies between preclinical efficacies and inconclusive clinic outcomes of these polyphenols."

Design: Survey. Setting: Newfoundland and Labrador. Participants: Parents waiting in their family doctors' offices. Main outcome measures: Parent and child demographic characteristics; pediatric chronic medical conditions affecting the children; prescribed medications, over-the-counter medications, and NHPs used by the children; why the medications and NHPs were being used, the dose, and parents' assessments of the effectiveness and side effects; and where parents had heard about the NHPs, whether they had told their physicians that the children were taking the products, and where they had obtained the products. Results: A total of 202 (53.4%) of the 378 eligible adults who were approached completed the survey. This represented 333 children. Mean (SD) age of the children was 5.1 (3.3) years. Overall, 28.7% of parents reported using nonvitamin NHPs for their children. A total of 137 children (41.1%) had taken NHPs (including vitamins); 61.1% of the NHPs being used were vitamins. The remainder fell under teas (primarily chamomile and green teas), echinacea, fish or omega-3 oils, and a large category of ""other"" products. These NHPs were most commonly used to improve general health, improve immunity, and prevent colds and infections. Approximately half of the parents (51.7%) believed their children had benefited from taking NHPs, and 4.4% believed their children had experienced adverse side effects. Slightly less than half of the parents (45.0%) had informed their physicians that their children were taking NHPs. Conclusion: Overall, 45.5% of parents attending physicians' offices reported using NHPs in their children. If vitamins are not included in the definition of NHPs, this rate drops to 28.7%. Parents most commonly use NHPs to maintain the general health of their children, to prevent colds, and to boost children's immune systems. About half of the parents believed the NHPs helped, very few had noticed any side effects, and approximately half had informed their physicians that they were giving their children NHPs."

To maintain robust immunity, athletes should eat a well-balanced diet sufficient to meet their energy, carbohydrate, protein, and micronutrient requirements. Dietary deficiencies of protein and specific micronutrients have long been associated with immune dysfunction and an adequate intake of iron, zinc, and vitamins A, D, E, B6 and B12 is particularly important in the maintenance of immune function. Consuming carbohydrate during prolonged strenuous exercise attenuates rises in stress hormones and appears to limit the degree of exercise-induced immune depression. Similar effects can be seen with daily ingestion of high-dose antioxidant vitamin supplements, though concerns have been expressed that excessive antioxidant intake may impair exercise training adaptations. It is safe to say with reasonable confidence that individual amino acids, colostrum, Echinacea, and zinc are unlikely to boost immunity or reduce infection risk in athletes. The ingestion of carbohydrate during exercise and daily consumption of probiotic and plant polyphenol (e.g. quercetin)-containing supplements or foodstuffs (e.g. non-alcoholic beer) currently offer the best chance of success. This approach is likely to be most effective for individuals who are particularly prone to illness."

1_h,health_belief,36215275,Does smoking cause death?,smoking causes death,1.0,"Smoking is a global health risk for premature death and disease. Recently, addictive behaviors, like smoking, were considered to be guided by explicit and implicit processes. The existence of a dissociation between the two attitudes in nonsmokers and the causes of the differences in implicit attitudes toward smoking have not been fully investigated. We investigated the explicit and implicit attitudes toward smoking via a self-reported scale and the single category implicit association test (SC-IAT), respectively, among undergraduate and graduate health sciences students. In addition, we applied the drift-diffusion model (DDM) on the SC-IAT and examined the behavioral characteristics that caused differences in implicit attitude toward smoking between smokers and nonsmokers. The results showed the existence of a dissociation between explicit and implicit attitudes toward smoking among nonsmokers. In addition, nonsmokers had a higher decision threshold than smokers and a higher drift rate in the condition where negative words were associated with smoking. Nonsmokers engaged in SC-IAT with more cautious attitudes and responded more easily in a negative condition since it was consistent with their true attitudes. Conversely, smokers did not show a significant difference in the drift rate between the conditions. These results suggested that the differences in an implicit attitude between smokers and nonsmokers were caused by differences in evidence accumulation speed between the positive and negative conditions. The existence of dissociation between implicit and explicit attitudes toward smoking may indicate the difficulty of measuring true attitude in nonsmokers in a questionnaire survey. Additionally, the DDM results explained the difference of implicit attitude between smokers and nonsmokers; it may provide information on the mechanisms of addictive behaviors and a basis for therapy. However, whether these results are affected by cultural differences requires further investigation."

The present study aimed to explore the relationship between the MTHFR C677T variant, plasma homocysteine, and risk of developing large-artery atherosclerotic ischemic stroke (LAAIS) among Han Chinese. A population-based case-control study, which included 1810 patients with LAAIS and 1765 unrelated control subjects, was conducted. Compared to the controls, LAAIS patients had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and alcohol consumption (P .001), as well as significantly higher mean fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and plasma homocysteine levels (P .001). The TT homozygous genotype correlated with increased risk of developing LAAIS, as indicated by a significantly higher odds ratio (OR) compared to the CT and CC genotypes, in both additive (OR = 3.215, P = .01) and recessive models (OR = 3.265, P = .01). The plasma homocysteine level was genotype-dependent according to the following trend: TT &gt; CT &gt; CC. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that, in spite of its low prevalence in both patients and controls (1.5% vs 0.8%), the MTHFR C677T variant could, at least in part, affect homocysteine levels and this, either alone or in combination with other factors, increases the risk of LAAIS."

There is an increase in attention to homocysteine as a causal of CAD. In Palestine, CAD is more common than that in regional surrounding areas. Coronary artery disease is considered the leading cause of death in the West Bank, according to Palestinian Ministry of health annual reports. The study was conducted to determine the level of homocysteine in individuals with no history of CAD and to determine the relationship between CAD and total homocysteine levels and classical risk factors of CAD. Methods: our study is a hospital-based case-control study. A sample size of 84 cases and 81 controls were included in the study. Results: there is a statistically significant increase in plasma total homocysteine level in cases compared to controls (P=0.04) with Odds ratio= 2. There is also a statistically significant association between plasma total homocysteine levels and age of 50 years and above and male gender among both study groups (P= 0.002 and 0.007, respectively). The study showed no significant association between plasma total homocysteine level and the CAD´s classical risk factors among the case group measured in the study, which are diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and smoking (P=0.5, 0.1, and 0.5, respectively). Conclusion: there is a significant difference in homocysteine levels between case and control groups. Coronary artery disease patients have double homocysteine levels compared to those healthy individuals with OR= 2. Healthy Palestinian individuals have a homocysteine level that is lower than that of regional communities. Homocysteine levels increase with advanced age and male gender. There is no significant relation between hyperhomocysteinemia and diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and smoking."
1_h,health_belief,36121817,Does smoking cause death?,smoking causes death,1.0,"Background: Thrombosis is common in subjects suffering from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer. Hypercoagulation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of thrombosis. Therefore, the inactivation of thrombin, the key enzyme in coagulation, is tightly regulated via antithrombin (AT). AT deficiency is related to thrombosis and cardiovascular death. In this study we investigated the association between AT levels and mortality, in particularly cardiovascular-related and cancer-related death in the general population. Methods: We studied the association of AT levels and mortality in a prospective cohort sampled from the general Italian population (n = 19,676). AT levels were measured in the baseline samples, and mortality was recorded during a median follow-up period of 8.2 years. Cox regression was performed to investigate the association of all-cause, CVD-related and cancer-related mortality with variations in AT levels. Results: In total, 989 subjects died during follow-up, of which 373 subjects of CVD and 353 of cancer-related causes. Cox analysis revealed that, after adjustment for age, sex, current smoking, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, history of cardiovascular disease, history of cancer, vitamin K antagonists, antiplatelet medication, heparin and oral contraceptives AT levels were not associated with all-cause mortality (HRQ1vsQ5: 0.92, 95% CI:0.74-1.15). Interestingly, the risk of CVD-related mortality was reduced in subjects with low AT levels compared to subjects with higher AT levels, after adjustment for age and sex and other confounders did not change the association (HRQ1vsQ5: 0.64, 95% CI:0.44-0.91). Moreover, low AT levels were associated with increased cancer mortality in a fully adjusted model (HRQ1vsQ2-5: 1.26, 95% CI:0.88-1.81). Conclusions: Low AT levels are associated to a lower risk of fatal cardiovascular events in the general population, regardless of age, sex and medication use. In contrast, low AT levels are associated with lower cancer survival. For the first time we show that AT levels lower than the normal range in the general population, even before the development or diagnosis of cancer, are associated with an elevated risk of cancer death."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most frequent type of PC, being a highly aggressive malignancy and having a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. Non-modifiable (family history, age, genetic susceptibility) and modifiable (smoking, alcohol, acute and chronic pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, intestinal microbiota) risk factors are involved in PC pathogenesis. Chronic inflammation induced by various factors plays crucial roles in PC development from initiation to metastasis. In multiple malignant conditions such as PC, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors activate the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) signaling pathway, which plays key roles in cell growth, survival, proliferation, metabolism, and motility. Currently, mTOR, AKT, and PI3K inhibitors are used in clinical studies. Moreover, PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitors are being tested in vitro and in vivo with promising results for PC patients. The main aim of this review is to present PC incidence, risk factors, tumor microenvironment development, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR dysregulation and inhibitors used in clinical, in vivo, and in vitro studies."

Immune checkpoint inhibitor pneumonia (CIP) is a potentially fatal adverse event, but there is still a lack of effective markers and prediction models to identify patients at increased risk of CIP. Methods: A total of 369 cancer patients treated between 2017 and 2022 with immune checkpoint inhibitors at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University and Liaoning People's Hospital were recruited for this study. Independent variables were selected by differences and binary logistic regression analysis, and a risk assessment nomogram was constructed for CIP risk. The accuracy and discriminative abilities of the nomogram were evaluated by calibration plots, receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) and decision curve analyses (DCAs). Results: Binary logistic regression analysis showed that smoking history, acute phase proteins [interleukin (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP)], CD8 + T lymphocyte count and serum alveolar protein [surface protein-A (SP-A) and Krebs Von den Lungen-6 (KL-6)] were significantly associated with CIP risk.

An understanding of the drivers of any increase in incidence of young stroke also requires comparisons with stroke trends at older ages and with trends in incidence of other vascular events at younger ages. Objective: To determine temporal changes in incidence of stroke and other major vascular events at younger vs older ages. Design, setting, and participants: Prospective population-based incidence study conducted from April 2002 to March 2018 with a mean catchment population of 94 567 in Oxfordshire, England. Exposures: Calendar time, premorbid vascular risk factors, and occupation. Main outcomes and measures: Changes in incidence of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and other major vascular events (myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and peripheral vascular events) stratified by age, sex, diagnostic workup, etiology, and severity. Results: A total of 2429 incident strokes were ascertained (mean age, 73.6 [SD, 14.4] years; 51.3% female). From 2002-2010 to 2010-2018, stroke incidence increased significantly among participants younger than 55 years (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.67; 95% CI, 1.31-2.14) but fell significantly among participants aged 55 years or older (IRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.92; P .001 for difference). The significant increase in incidence at younger than 55 years was independent of sex, stroke severity, pathological subtype, and changes in investigation and was also seen for TIA (IRR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.36-2.57) but not for myocardial infarction and other major vascular events (IRR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58-0.93). Although TIA and stroke at younger than 55 years were significantly associated with diabetes (risk ratio [RR], 3.47; 95% CI, 2.54-4.74), hypertension (RR, 2.52; 95% CI, 2.04-3.12), current smoking (RR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.92-2.94), and obesity (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07-1.72), the significant increase in incidence from 2002-2010 to 2010-2018 was still seen in individuals without these risk factors. The increase was greatest in professional/managerial occupations (IRR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.75-3.62) and least in partially skilled/unskilled occupations (IRR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.79-1.74). The proportion of TIAs and strokes among those younger than 55 years without known vascular risk factors increased significantly over time (45 [30.4%] vs 115 [42.4%]; absolute difference, 12.0%; 95% CI, 2.6-21.5), especially in patients with cryptogenic events (10 [18.5%] vs 63 [49.2%]; absolute difference, 30.7%; 95% CI, 17.2-44.2; P .001; P = .002 for heterogeneity). Conclusions and relevance: Comparing persons living in Oxfordshire, England, in 2002-2010 vs 2010-2018, there was a significant increase in stroke incidence in those younger than 55 years, but a decrease in those aged 55 years or older. Given the absence of this divergence for other vascular events, further research is needed to understand the causes of this difference."

Methods: A cohort of 38 adult patients with acute thigh compartment syndrome treated with fasciotomy at two tertiary care referral centers over a 10-year time period from January 1, 2006 to June 30, 2015 were retrospectively identified. We searched the electronic medical record for patient-related variables (e.g., age, sex, race, smoking status, diabetes mellitus), injury-related variables (e.g., mechanism of injury, associated fractures, other traumatic injuries), treatment-related variables (e.g., delay to treatment, compartments released, number of debridements, use of split-thickness grafts), and outcomes (e.g., amputation, death, sensory/motor impairments at final follow-up). Results: The mean age of our cohort was 47 years, and 35 patients (92%) were male. There were various mechanisms of injury, but the most common mechanisms were spontaneous hematoma (21%), followed by motor vehicle accidents (16%). Associated leg fractures were present in 15 (39%) patients. Delay between time of injury and fasciotomy was greater than 24 hours in 27 patients (71%), 12 to 24 hours in 6 patients (16%), and less than 6 hours in 3 patients (8%). The most frequently released compartment was the anterior compartment only (68%), followed by both the anterior and posterior compartments (16%) and the posterior compartment only (11%). Six patients (16%) had motor impairment, and 2 patients (5%) had sensory impairment at final follow-up. There were 2 deaths (5%) recorded in the hospital course for this cohort, none of which were directly related to compartment syndrome of the thigh. Conclusion: Delays to fasciotomy are frequent in the treatment of acute thigh compartment syndrome. The demographics of acute thigh compartment syndrome demonstrate a strong male predominance. Treating providers should recognize spontaneous hematoma and motor vehicle accidents as the most common causes of acute thigh compartment syndrome."

With the acceleration of the aging process, the problem of providing care for pressure ulcers for the bedridden elderly becomes increasingly urgent. This study conducts a field survey based on the research status of 221 disabled elderly in 16 communities on 7 typical streets in Beijing, focusing on the problem of pressure ulcer complications caused by bedridden. An automatic inflatable airbag mattress is designed according to anthropometric dimensions of bedridden elderly, pressure ulcer-prone areas, and the decompression standard, so that the airbag mattress can reduce the pressure in its initial shape. To achieve accurate control of the pressure in the pressure-prone areas of an airbag, air pressure control system is proposed which can control airbags individually and link multiple airbags, evaluating the safety of pressure ulcer points based on the data from sensors and making corresponding air pressure changes to reduce the possibility of generating pressure ulcers. The proposed pressure ulcer preventing system will be an efficient healthcare tool for families who had elderly bedridden patients, patients with chronic degenerative disease side effects, and terminal and postsurgical patients, as well as femur fractures, in their homes."

Subjects consuming the test product had an overall significant increase in skin elasticity (+40%; P .0001) when compared to placebo. Histological analysis of skin biopsies revealed positive changes in the skin architecture, with a reduction in solar elastosis and improvement in collagen fiber organization in the test product group. As reported in the self-perception questionnaires, these results were confirmed by the subjects' own perceptions in that participants agreed their skin was more hydrated and more elastic. In addition, the consumption of the test product reduced joint pain by -43% and improved joint mobility by +39%. Oral supplementation with collagen bioactive peptides combined with chondroitin sulphate, glucosamine, L-carnitine, vitamins, and minerals significantly improved the clinical parameters related to skin aging and joint health, and therefore, might be an effective solution to slow down the hallmarks of aging."

Many of its functions include temperature regulation, immunity from microorganisms, maintaining electrolyte balance, and protection from physical injuries, chemical agents and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Aging occurs in every layer of the skin, primarily due to the degradation of its components. Induction of degradative enzymes and the abundant production of reactive oxygen species lead to skin aging. Understanding the complexity of skin structure and factors contributing to the skin aging will help us impede the aging process. Applications of anti-aging products are a common method to prevent or repair damages that lead to aging. Conclusion: This review will provide information on the causes and indicators of skin aging as well as examine studies that have used plants to produce anti-aging products."
2_h,health_belief,29102224,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"Background: Persistent ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the form of sunlight causes photo-aging of the skin by reducing the production of type I collagen, the major constituent of the extracellular matrix of the dermis. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β transforms dermal fibroblasts into α2-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2)-expressing myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts produce a precursor form of type I collagen, type I procollagen (collagen I), consisting of pro-alpha1 (produced by the COL1A1 gene) and pro-alpha2 chains (produced by the COL1A2 gene). Smad2/3 is a key downstream molecule of TGF-β signaling. The mechanisms through which UV inhibits collagen I synthesis are not fully understood. 6-Formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) is an endogenous tryptophan photo-metabolite generated by UV irradiation. FICZ is well known as a high-affinity ligand for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). However, the physiological roles of FICZ in photo-aging have yet to be addressed. Objective: To evaluate the effects of FICZ on the TGF-β-mediated ACTA2 and collagen I expression in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were performed to determine the expression of ACTA2, COL1A1, and COL1A2 in NHDFs with or without FICZ and TGF-β. The phosphorylated Smad2/3 (pSmad2/3) protein levels in cytoplasmic or nuclear portions were investigated by western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted to evaluate pSmad2/3 localization, and F-actin staining with phalloidin was performed to visualize actin polymerization in myofibroblasts. The actions of FICZ on the TGF-β-mediated collagen I expression and nuclear translocation of pSmad2/3 were analyzed in the presence of selective AHR antagonists or in AHR-knockdown NHDFs. Results: We found that FICZ significantly inhibited the TGF-β-induced upregulation of mRNA and protein levels of ACTA2 and collagen I and actin polymerization in myofibroblasts. FICZ did not disturb the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Notably, FICZ reduced the expression of pSmad2/3 in the nucleus, while it increased that in the cytoplasm, suggesting that it inhibits the nuclear translocation of pSmad2/3 induced by TGF-β. The inhibitory actions of FICZ on the TGF-β-mediated collagen I expression and nuclear translocation of pSmad2/3 were independent of AHR signaling. Another endogenous AHR agonist, kynurenine, also inhibited the TGF-β-mediated ACTA2 and collagen I upregulation in NHDFs in an AHR-independent manner; however, its effects were insignificant in comparison with those of FICZ. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the endogenous photo-product FICZ may be a key chromophore that involves in photo-aging. Downregulation of FICZ signaling is thus a potential strategy to protect against photo-aging."

2_h,health_belief,10338266,Does skin product cause aging?,skin product causes aging,0.0,"During her lifetime, a woman faces the possibility of seeking dermatological assistance for a myriad of conditions, including acne, rosacea, striae, photodamage, and skin cancers. It is important for clinicians and patients to be aware of the symptoms of these conditions as well as the most beneficial approaches for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management. The life expectancy of women has increased and predictions for the year 2050 estimate the average age at 81 years. This will place women at greater risk for dermatological problems, especially photodamage and skin cancer. In addition, various ethnic groups may manifest these conditions differently. Although acne is most prevalent among teenaged males, most can expect clearing by age 25. Females may continue to experience acne into the adult years, sometimes beyond the age of 40. Although it is not a life-threatening disease, acne may have psychosocial and quality-of-life consequences. Treatments for acne can be topical or systemic, and include retinoids, antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and hormonal therapy. Rosacea is more common in women (especially during menopause) than in men. It is a chronic condition that can cause complications, including telangiectasia, conjunctivitis, and blepharitis. Although there is no cure, rosacea can be managed and controlled with medication. Topical antibiotics, such as metronidazole, and systemic antibiotics, such as tetracycline, clarithromycin, and doxycycline, are used to manage rosacea. Striae, or stretch marks, occur most frequently in pregnant women, adolescents experiencing growth spurts, weight lifters, and the obese. Although not a health threat, they can be psychologically distressing. There are not many treatment options for striae, but topical tretinoin and the pulsed dye laser offer promising results. Intrinsic, or normal, aging of the skin results from the process of chronological aging. Photodamage is skin damage caused by chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. It is the leading cause of extrinsic aging, or alterations of the skin due to environmental exposure. Estimates indicate that almost half of a person's UV exposure occurs by age 18. Photoaging causes numerous histologic, physiologic, and clinical changes; it also increases the risk for skin cancer. Photodamage can be prevented through the use of sun screens, protective clothing, and avoidance of the sun during peak intensity time. The only product approved by the FDA for the treatment of photodamage (fine wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, and skin roughness), topical tretinoin emollient cream, may help prevent additional photoaging when it is used to treat existing photoaging. Other management options for photodamaged skin include alpha-hydroxy acids, antioxidants, antiandrogens, moisturizers, and exfoliants. In patients with excessive manifestations of photodamage, surgical management may be needed, including dermabrasion, chemical peels, soft tissue augmentation, laser resurfacing, botulism toxin, and Gortex threads. Clinicians must educate their patients about the most appropriate skin care regimen as well as approaches for preventing and treating common afflictions. In this way, women will have the best opportunity for having and maintaining healthy skin."

Activation of the MEK/MAPK pathway in TNBC has been associated with resistance to conventional chemotherapy and biologic agents and has a significant role in poor clinical outcomes. NV1066, a replication-competent herpes virus, infected, replicated in and killed all TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, HCC1806, HCC38, HCC1937, HCC1143) tested. Greater than 90% cell kill was achieved in more-sensitive lines (MDA-MB-231, HCC1806, HCC38) by day 6 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. In less-sensitive lines (HCC1937, HCC1143), NV1066 still achieved &gt;70% cell kill by day 7 (MOI 1.0). In vivo, mean volume of flank tumors 14 days after treatment with NV1066 was 57 versus 438 mm(3) in controls (P=0.002).

Only 45% of all population has access to health services, the consequence is delay in diagnosis and treatment. In Mexico, 66% of all new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in locally advanced stages. From May 2007 the Health System Protection Against Catastrophic Expenses, called Seguro Popular (SP), breast cancer was included in covering the treatment of this neoplasm in any patient without access to social security. Objective: To evaluate the results and impact of SP in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment of a group of patients diagnosed with breast cancer at an institution of national reference. Material and methods: We analyzed a group of 259 patients in stages (I-IIIC). The clinical stages I and II (55 patients) were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy FAC -T (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, adriamycin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC) followed by 12 weeks of paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 +/- trastuzumab loading dose of 4 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg); 204 patients in locally advanced stages (IIB-IIIC) received FAC-T +/- trastuzumab followed by surgery. Adjuvant treatment consisted of endocrine therapy for hormone-sensitive patients and radiotherapy 50 cGy according to international standards. Results: The age at diagnosis was 47 years (range 23-68). 80% of them were locally advanced stages (IIB-IIIC) and were treated in a neoadjuvant setting, 20% was in early stages, treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy The disease-free survival and overall survival at 30 months was 85.7 and 90% respectively. Overall pathologic complete response was obtained in 15% of cases. In the subgroup analysis showed that 41% of patients HER2 (+), 29% of triple-negative patients and 9% of hormone-sensitive tumors achieved complete pathological response (p = 0.0001). Conclusion: This is the first analysis of efficacy of adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer since the introduction of popular secure non-entitled population. It is clear that treatment efficacy is similar to that reported in the literature, with 15% of pRC and survival to 30 months in 94-80%. The coverage of health expenditures treats a larger number of patients optimally. Along with this, efforts should be made to reduce the high frequency of diagnosis at advanced stage."
3_h,health_belief,21289296,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"It is a challenge to develop a universal single drug that can treat breast cancer at single- or multiple-stage complications, yet remains nontoxic to normal cells. The challenge is even greater when breast cancer-specific, estrogen-based drugs are being developed that cannot act against multistaged breast cancer complications owing to the cells differential estrogen receptor (ER) expression status and their possession of drug-resistant and metastatic phenotypes. We report here the development of a first cationic lipid-conjugated estrogenic derivative (ESC8) that kills breast cancer cells independent of their ER expression status. This ESC8 molecule apparently is nontoxic to normal breast epithelial cells, as well as to other noncancer cells. ESC8 induces apoptosis through an intrinsic pathway in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, ESC8 treatment induces autophagy in these cells by interfering with the mTOR activity. This is the first example of an estrogen structure-based molecule that coinduces apoptosis and autophagy in breast cancer cells. Further in vivo study confirms the role of this molecule in tumor regression. Together, our results open new perspective of breast cancer chemotherapy through a single agent, which could provide the therapeutic benefit across all stages of breast cancer."
3_h,health_belief,19291366,Does chemotherapy treat breast cancer?,chemotherapy treats breast cancer,1.0,"We have developed an effective bacterial cancer therapy strategy by targeting viable tumor tissue using Salmonella typhimurium auxotrophs that we have generated which grow in viable as well as necrotic areas of tumors. However, the auxotrophy severely restricts growth of these bacteria in normal tissue. The S. typhimurium A1-R mutant, which is auxotrophic for leu-arg and has high anti-tumor virulence, was developed in our laboratory. In vitro, A1-R infects tumor cells and causes nuclear destruction. A1-R was initially used to treat metastatic human prostate and breast tumors that had been orthotopically implanted in nude mice. Forty percent of treated mice were cured completely and survived as long as non-tumor-bearing mice. A1-R administered i.v. to nude mice with primary osteosarcoma and lung metastasis was highly effective, especially against metastasis. A1-R was also targeted to both axillary lymph and popliteal lymph node metastasis of human pancreatic cancer and fibrosarcoma, respectively, as well as lung metastasis of the fibrosarcoma in nude mice. The bacteria were delivered via a lymphatic channel to target the lymph node metastases and systemically via the tail vein to target the lung metastasis. The metastases were cured without the need of chemotherapy or any other treatment. A1-R was administered intratumorally to nude mice with an orthotopically transplanted human pancreatic tumor. The primary pancreatic cancer regressed without additional chemotherapy or any other treatment. A1-R was also effective against pancreatic cancer liver metastasis when administered intrasplenically to nude mice. The approach described here, where bacterial monotherapy effectively treats primary and metastatic tumors, is a significant improvement over previous bacterial tumor-therapy strategies that require combination with toxic chemotherapy. Three promoter clones engineered in S. enterica typhimurium were identified to have enhanced expression in bacteria growing in tumors relative to those growing in the spleen. The expression of therapeutics in Salmonella under the regulation of one or more promoters that are activated preferentially in tumors has the potential to improve the efficacy of Salmonella tumor therapy. Exploitation of the tumor-killing capability of Salmonella has great promise for a new paradigm of cancer therapy."

Burr Proton Therapy Center has a 230 MeV cyclotron from which proton beams are directed to two isocentric gantries, a stereotactic intracranial beam line, and an eye line. Because of improved physical dose distribution, proton radiotherapy allows dose escalation to improve local tumor control in anatomic sites and histologies where local control is suboptimal with photons. The improved dose localization also reduces normal-tissue doses with an anticipated reduction in acute and late toxicity. Clinical treatment protocols, developed to exploit the dosimetric advantages of protons over photons, have been grouped into two broad categories. In the first, dose is escalated for anatomic sites where local control with conventional radiation doses has been suboptimal. In the second, normal-tissue sparing with protons is designed to minimize acute and late toxicity. Treatment of patients on clinical research protocols has been encouraged. Patient treatments began on the first gantry in November 2001; on the eye line in April 2002; on the second gantry in May 2002; and on the stereotactic intracranial line in August 2006. The facility currently treats 60 patients per day, including up to six children daily under anesthesia. Dose-escalation studies have been completed for early stage prostate cancer (in conjunction with Loma Linda University) and sarcomas of the cervical spine/base of skull and thoracolumbosacral spine. Protocols are in progress or development for carcinoma of the nasopharynx, paranasal sinus carcinoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. Studies evaluating the use of protons for morbidity reduction include protocols for craniospinal irradiation in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy for medulloblastoma, retinoblastoma, pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma, other pediatric sarcomas, and accelerated, hypofractionated partial breast irradiation for T1N0 breast carcinomas. For pediatric patients, protons have also been accepted as an alternative to photons for children enrolled in Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols. Treatment of patients on these studies has often required the development of new treatment techniques (i.e., matching abutting fields for craniospinal irradiation), respiratory gating, and development of appropriate clinical infrastructure support (i.e., increase in availability of pediatric anesthesia) to allow appropriate treatment. In addition, a clinical research infrastructure for protocol development and data management is required. Results to date indicate that proton radiation therapy offers several potential treatment advantages to patients that can be studied in the setting of clinical trials. Patients' willingness to enter these clinical trials seems to be quite high; accrual to selected studies has been favorable."

Methods: Studies of risedronate were obtained from the MEDLINE database (1966 to the present) of references using risedronate, risedronic acid, osteoporosis, and human subject as keywords. Additional references were sought from the reference lists of the articles obtained. Results: Nine randomized controlled trials and 7 other clinical trials were obtained. In postmenopausal women with normal bone density, risedronate increases lumbar spine bone density and preserves femoral neck density. In postmenopausal women with prior vertebral fracture, risedronate decreases new vertebral and nonvertebral fracture incidence. In patients who experienced breast cancer and who have chemotherapy-induced menopause, risedronate preserves bone. Risedronate prevents vertebral bone loss in patients beginning long-term corticosteroid therapy. Risedronate decreases pagetic bone pain and induces radiological improvement in pagetic lesions. Risedronate induces normalization of biochemical abnormalities and may be more effective than etidronate disodium for Paget disease. Only one study, a trial in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis using a low dose (2.5 mg) of risedronate, did not have a positive result. Adverse effects in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis, breast cancer, and Paget disease and in those taking corticosteroids are similar to those of patients taking placebo, and do not include notable upper gastrointestinal tract adverse event rates or serious adverse events. Conclusions: Risedronate prevents postmenopausal bone loss, decreases fracture in those with established postmenopausal osteoporosis, effectively treats Paget disease, and prevents corticosteroid-induced bone loss. Long-term toxic effects and efficacy, particularly fracture end point data, are unknown. Also undefined are optimal duration of therapy, potential for use in combination with other agents, and direct comparison with other bisphosphonates used for osteoporosis."

A common type of smokeless tobacco ""Shammah"" is prevalent in this region. This study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of the possible psychosocial determinants of Shammah consumption among adult Shammah users in Jazan region. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted by means of one-on-one interviews among thirty adult Shammah users. Participants were recruited by means of a purposive sampling technique. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview guide utilizing face-to-face and phone-call interviews. Thematic analysis with hybrid approach was used to analyze the dataset. Results: Twenty-four sub-codes within four overarching themes were generated. Participants revealed uncertainty related to Shammah composition, how to quit knowledge and Shammah prevention/cessation programs. Shammah use identified as a normal phenomenon in society. Its use was frequently reported in participants' close network but most users faced family and peers' disapproval. Some users expressed joy, happiness and focused when using Shammah. Others were disgusted or neutral. Many users believed Shammah causes cancer and tears oral tissues. Others believed it relieves toothache or has no effect. Majority of users were confident to quit and recalled some quitting aids. Toothache, craving, drinking tea and chewing Khat (leaves of Catha edulis plant that causes moderate euphoria) perceived to be triggers to use Shammah. Availability of Shammah, withdrawal symptoms, stress, lack of support, seeing others using Shammah, losing part of routine and toothache were barriers to quit. Conclusions: Shammah use was associated with uncertainty about Shammah composition and quitting knowledge, social acceptability, influence from family/friends, a range of positive and negative attitudinal beliefs toward its use and high quitting efficacy beliefs. Future interventions targeting Shammah should address the acknowledged triggers and barriers in the present study including the dual use of Shammah and Khat."

Switching to noncombustible products can reduce disease risk, but misperceptions that nicotine causes cancer might impact relative harm perceptions about noncombustible products and considering switching. Identifying which smokers are most likely to hold this misperception and associated beliefs can inform the content of and priority audiences for corrective messaging. Methods: Bivariable log binomial models were run on a sample of 9,013 adult established smokers from Wave 3 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health. Post hoc testing identified groups and beliefs associated with significantly higher-than-average prevalence of the misperception. Results: About 61.2% of smokers believe nicotine causes cancer or don't know. Non-Hispanic Black (PR: 2.09) and Hispanic (PR: 1.73) smokers, as well as those making under $10,000 a year (PR: 1.36) had significantly higher-than-average prevalence of the misperception. Smokers who had recently used ENDS or smokeless tobacco had significantly lower-than-average prevalence of the misperception (PR: 0.70 and 0.63, respectively). Prevalence of nicotine misperceptions was significantly higher-than-average among those who recognized all ten smoking-caused diseases (PR: 1.34), believed additive-free cigarettes were more harmful than regular cigarettes (PR: 1.71), or did not report subjective norms supporting noncombustible use (PR: 1.05). Conclusion: High perceived threat of tobacco may be overgeneralized to nicotine. High prevalence of the misperception among Non-Hispanic Black and low-income smokers is concerning, considering existing health disparities. Messaging should attempt to correct the misperception that nicotine causes cancer. Inferential reasoning after message exposure should assess accuracy of relative harm perceptions. Implications: The current study supports the need for corrective messaging to address the misperception that nicotine causes cancer. Identifying that nicotine misperceptions are associated with higher harm perceptions about tobacco suggests that there may be unintended consequences of high perceived harm of tobacco that need to be addressed. As nicotine misperceptions are significantly more prevalent among those already at higher risk of tobacco caused diseases, care should be taken to ensure equity in message dissemination."

Here, we examine the oral bacteriome of smokers and of smokeless tobacco users, in comparison to healthy controls, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Methods: Oral swab samples were collected from smokers, smokeless tobacco users, and healthy controls (n = 44). Microbial DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA gene profiled using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequencing reads were processed using DADA2, and taxonomical classification was performed using the phylogenetic placement method. Differentially abundant taxa were identified using DESeq2, while functional metagenomes based on KEGG orthology abundance were inferred using LIMMA. Results: A significantly higher microbial diversity was observed in smokeless tobacco users and smokers relative to controls (P 0.05). Compositional differences in microbial communities were observed in all comparisons with healthy controls (PERMANOVA P 0.05) but not between smokers and smokeless tobacco users.

In addition, the relative abundance of three bacterial taxa belonging to genera Fusobacterium spp., Catonella, and Fretibacterium spp. was significantly increased in smokeless tobacco users relative to controls (BH adj P 0.01). Major functional pathways significantly increased in smokeless tobacco users relative to both controls, and smokers were similar and involved amino acid metabolism including glutamate and aspartate biosynthesis and degradation (log FC &gt; 1.5; BH adj P 0.01). Conclusions: A distinct taxonomic and functional profile of oral microbiome in smokers and smokeless tobacco users as compared to healthy controls implicates a significant role of microbes and their metabolites in diseases associated with tobacco use including oral cancer. Clinical relevance: Future efforts in preventive, diagnostic, curative, and prognostic strategies for diseases associated with tobacco use in smokers and smokeless tobacco users could incorporate the oral microbiome."

Oral cancer, even though being the tenth most common cancer in the world, gets diagnosed at an advanced stage and ends up with poor prognosis. So early diagnosis is the need of the hour. Our study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic changes in patients with different tobacco habits using buccal exfoliated cells. Methods: Buccal smears were taken from smokers (30), smokeless tobacco users (30), combined tobacco users (30) and controls (30) with clinically normal oral mucosa. All the smears were stained with Papanicolaou stain and Feulgen stain and viewed under light microscope for the evaluation of mean number of micronuclei, mean micronuclei per cell, frequency of cells showing micronuclei, nuclear area, cytoplasmic area, nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. Results: Mean number of micronuclei, mean micronuclei per cell, frequency of cells showing micronuclei, and nuclear area were significantly increased in tobacco users than controls, especially in combined tobacco users. Nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio was increased and cytoplasmic area was decreased in tobacco users than controls. Conclusion: Tobacco in any consumable form is genotoxic. Smoking and smokeless tobacco, when consumed together, synergistically causes higher genetic damage. Different tobacco habits have different deleterious effects on oral mucosa, and these effects are more pronounced when the patients have combined habits. So, detecting the genotoxic changes through exfoliative cytology can be used as a simple yet reliable marker for early detection of carcinogenesis. br /&gt;."

The microbial community ferment compounds present in the smokeless tobacco products and convert them into carcinogens like tobacco-associated nitrosamines. However, the potential of smokeless tobacco products associated bacteriome to manipulate systemic inflammation and other signaling pathways involved in the etiology of oral cancer will be a risk factor for oral cancer. Further, damage to oral epithelial cells causes a leaky oral layer that leads to increased infiltration of bacterial components like lipopolysaccharide, flagellin, and toxins, etc. The consumption of smokeless tobacco products can cause damage to the oral layer and dysbiosis of oral microbiota. Hence, the enrichment of harmful microbes due to dysbiosis in the oral cavity can produce high levels of bacterial metabolites and provoke inflammation as well as carcinogenesis. Understanding the complex and dynamic interrelation between the smokeless tobacco-linked bacteriome and host oral microbiome may help to unravel the mechanism of oral carcinogenesis stimulated by smokeless tobacco products. This review provides an insight into smokeless tobacco product-associated bacteriome and their potential in the progression of oral cancer. In the future, this will guide in the evolution of prevention and treatment strategies against smokeless tobacco products-induced oral cancer. Besides, it will assist the government organizations for better management and cessation policy building for the worldwide problem of smokeless tobacco addiction."

The present study aimed to document various types of SLT products consumed and their potential impact on the genome instability on the population from Assam state in Northeast India. A cross-sectional study (n = 5000) showed that 60.56 % of the study population consumed at least one of the three forms (sadagura, zarda and khaini) of SLT of which 52.0 % were only sadagura users. Genotoxicity assessment using buccal cytome assay in 240 age and sex matched volunteers revealed that except for zarda, other forms of SLT induced significantly higher incidence micronuclei in the buccal epithelial cells compared to the control individuals. Similar effects were also observed in other cytome parameters related to cell proliferation, cytokinesis defects and cell death. Significantly higher incidence of micronucleus was observed among sadagura and khaini users in lymphocyte cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay. The addition of lime in sadagura increased the pH and anion levels which possibly result in higher absorption and may lead to the development of cellular anomalies."

Biomarkers of potential harm (BOPH) can measure short-term health effects such as inflammation and oxidative stress. Methods: We compared BOPH concentrations [IL6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), and F2-isoprostane] across 3,460 adults in wave 1 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study (2013-2014) by tobacco use groups: primary ST users (current exclusive ST use among never smokers), secondary ST users (current exclusive ST use among former smokers), exclusive cigarette smokers, dual users of ST and cigarettes, former smokers, and never tobacco users. We estimated geometric mean ratios using never tobacco users, cigarette smokers, and former smokers as referents, adjusting for demographic and health conditions, creatinine (for F2-isoprostane), and pack-years in smoker referent models. Results: BOPH levels among primary ST users were similar to both never tobacco users and former smokers. Most BOPH levels were lower among ST users compared with current smokers. Compared with never tobacco users, dual users had significantly higher sICAM-1, IL6, and F2-isoprostane. However, compared with smokers, dual users had similar biomarker levels. Former smokers and secondary ST users had similar levels of all five biomarkers. Conclusions: ST users have lower levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers than smokers. Impact: ST use alone and in combination with smoking may result in different levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress levels."

His past medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia, erectile dysfunction, insomnia, and a recent diagnosis of depression. He denied previous history of depression but reported taking sertraline for premature ejaculation, an off-label use. His baseline aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 20 U/L and alanine transaminase (ALT) was 22 U/L. Bupropion was held on admission and olanzapine 5 mg nightly was initiated to treat mania. Following six days of olanzapine treatment, his liver function tests (LFTs) were elevated (AST = 83 U/L, ALT = 105 U/L) and peaked two days later at AST being 2,024 U/L and ALT being 1,508 U/L. Other causes of LFT elevation were ruled out since no other new medications were started and the patient denied use of acetaminophen. Olanzapine was subsequently discontinued and his LFTs began to improve. His symptoms of mania resolved, and he was discharged on no psychotropic medications. Review of Literature A literature search identified 6 cases of bupropion-induced mania/hypomania and 10 cases of olanzapine-induced increased LFTs. This case will add to the limited reports regarding these adverse effects. Conclusion Possible adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were observed between the initiation of bupropion and the development of manic symptoms as well as the initiation of olanzapine and elevated LFTs. The case report also focuses on the role of pharmacy in a patient with multiple ADRs from psychotropic medications and the importance of gaining collateral information and clarifying indications of prescribed medications."

Studies have shown that noise can lead to neuroinflammation, damage to synaptic plasticity and altered levels of neurotransmitters that may result in depression. The present study demonstrated that luteolin exerted antidepressant-like effects by improving neuroinflammation in a mouse model of noise-induced depression. Luteolin significantly alleviated noise-induced depression-like behavior. Notably, luteolin treatment not only remarkably ameliorated noise-induced inflammation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, but also increased synapsin. Furthermore, luteolin treatment significantly increased the contents of serum 5-hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine in noise-induced mice. In sum, luteolin exerts antidepressant effects indepression-like mice caused by noise, which can serve as a potential agent for the treatment of chronic noise-induced depression."

Our objective was to investigate healthcare resource utilization and costs associated with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) compared with non-treatment-resistant depression in Finland. Methods: Of all patients aged 16-65 years and diagnosed with depression in Finland during 2004-2016, persons with TRD (N = 15,405) were identified from nationwide registers and matched 1:1 with comparison persons with depression who initiated antidepressant use but did not have TRD at the time of matching. TRD was defined as initiation of a third treatment trial after having failed two pharmacological treatment trials. Follow-up period covered 5 years after TRD or corresponding matching date (until end of 2018). Health care resource utilization was studied with negative binomial regression and costs of TRD (per patient per year) with generalized estimating equations, by adjusting for baseline costs, comorbidity and baseline severity of depression. Results: Persons with TRD (mean age 38.7, SD 13.1, 60.0% women) had more health care utilization and work disability (sick leaves and disability pensions), adjusted incidence rate ratio for work disability days was 1.72 (95% CI 1.64-1.80). This resulted in 1.9-fold higher total costs for persons with TRD (15,907 versus 8335 EUR), adjusted mean difference 7572 (95% CI 7215-7929) EUR per patient per year, higher productivity losses (due to sick leaves and disability pensions, mean difference 5296, 95% CI 5042-5550), and direct healthcare costs (2003, 95% CI 1853-2151) compared with non-TRD patients. Mean difference was the highest during the first year after TRD (total costs difference 11,760, 95% CI 11,314-12,206) and the difference decreased gradually after that. Conclusion: Treatment-resistant depression is associated with about two-fold cost burden compared with non-treatment-resistant depression."

We quantify the contribution of alcohol-related deaths to the life-expectancy gap in depression in four European countries with differing levels of alcohol-related mortality. Methods: We used cohort data linking population registers with health-care and death records from Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Turin, Italy, in 1993-2007 (210,412,097 person years, 3046,754 deaths). We identified psychiatric inpatients with depression from hospital discharge registers in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden and outpatients with antidepressant prescriptions from prescription registers in Finland and Turin. We assessed alcohol-related and non-alcohol-related deaths using both underlying and contributory causes of death, stratified by sex, age and depression status. We quantified the contribution of alcohol-related deaths by cause-of-death decomposition of the life-expectancy gap at age 25 between people with and without depression. Results: The gap in life expectancy was 13.1-18.6 years between people with and without inpatient treatment for depression and 6.7-9.1 years between those with and without antidepressant treatment. The contribution of alcohol-related deaths to the life-expectancy gap was larger in Denmark (33.6%) and Finland (18.1-30.5%) - i.e., countries with high overall alcohol-related mortality - than in Sweden (11.9%) and Turin (3.2%), and larger among men in all countries. The life-expectancy gap due to other than alcohol-related deaths varied little across countries. Conclusions: Alcohol contributes heavily to the lower life expectancy in depression particularly among men and in countries with high overall alcohol-related mortality."

However, it is unclear how the DMN dysfunction in MDD patients is characterized by functional connectivity diversity or gradient and whether antidepressant therapy causes the abnormal functional gradient of the DMN to change toward normalization. In current work, we estimated the functional gradient of the DMN derived from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging in MDD patients (n = 70) and matching healthy controls (n = 43) and identified MDD-related functional connectivity diversity of the DMN. The longitudinal changes of the DMN functional gradient in 36 MDD patients were assessed before and after 12-week antidepressant treatment. Compared to the healthy controls, the functional gradient of the DMN exhibited relatively relative compression along the dorsal-medial axis in MDD patients at baseline and antidepressant treatment could normalize these DMN gradient abnormalities. A regularized least-squares regression model based on DMN gradient features at baseline significantly predicted the change of Hamilton Depression Rating (HAMD) Scale scores after antidepressant treatment. The medial prefrontal cortex gradient had a more contribution to prediction of antidepressant efficacy. Our findings provided a novel insight into the neurobiological mechanism underlying MDD from the perspective of the DMN functional gradient."

However, the molecular mechanism of TCA action in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract remains poorly understood. Transient receptor potential channel canonical type 4 (TRPC4), which is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> -permeable nonselective cation channel, is a critical regulator of GI excitability. Herein, we investigated whether TCA modulates TRPC4 channel activity and which mechanism in colonic myocytes consequently causes constipation. To prove the clinical benefit in patients with diarrhoea caused by TCA treatment, we performed mechanical tension recording of repetitive motor pattern (RMP) in segment, electric field stimulation (EFS)-induced and spontaneous contractions in isolated muscle strips. From these recordings, we observed that all TCA compounds significantly inhibited contractions of colonic motility in human. To determine the contribution of TRPC4 to colonic motility, we measured the electrical activity of heterologous or endogenous TRPC4 by TCAs using the patch clamp technique in HEK293 cells and murine colonic myocytes. In TRPC4-overexpressed HEK cells, we observed TCA-evoked direct inhibition of TRPC4. Compared with TRPC4-knockout mice, we identified that muscarinic cationic current (mI cat ) was suppressed through TRPC4 inhibition by TCA in isolated murine colonic myocytes. Collectively, we suggest that TCA action is responsible for the inhibition of TRPC4 channels in colonic myocytes, ultimately causing constipation. These findings provide clinical insights into abnormal intestinal motility and medical interventions aimed at IBS therapy."

The gut microbiome communicates with the brain through the neural, immune, and metabolic pathways, either directly (via vagal nerves) or indirectly (via gut- and microbial-derived metabolites as well as gut hormones and endocrine peptides, including peptide YY, pancreatic polypeptide, neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin, corticotropin-releasing factor, glucagon-like peptide, oxytocin, and ghrelin). Maintaining healthy gut microbiota (GM) is now being recognized as important for brain health through the use of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbial transplantation (FMT), etc. A few approaches exert antidepressant effects via restoring GM and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functions. In this review, we have summarized the etiopathogenic link between gut dysbiosis and depression with preclinical and clinical evidence.

Late-life depression (LLD) has been associated with inflammation and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-6, but often depressed individuals have comorbid medical conditions that are associated with immune dysregulation. To determine whether depression has an association with inflammation independent of medical illness, 1120 adults were screened to identify individuals who had clinically significant depression but not medical conditions associated with systemic inflammation. In total, 66 patients with LLD screened to exclude medical conditions associated with inflammation were studied in detail along with 26 age-matched controls (HC). At baseline, circulating cytokines were low and similar in LLD and HC individuals. Furthermore, cytokines did not change significantly after treatment with either an antidepressant (escitalopram 20 mg/day) or an antidepressant plus a COX-2 inhibitor or placebo, even though depression scores improved in the non-placebo treatment arms. An analysis of cerebrospinal fluid in a subset of individuals for IL-1β using an ultrasensitive digital enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed low levels in both LLD and HC at baseline. Our results indicate that depression by itself does not result in systemic or intrathecal elevations in cytokines and that celecoxib does not appear to have an adjunctive antidepressant role in older patients who do not have medical reasons for having inflammation. The negative finding for increased inflammation and the lack of a treatment effect for celecoxib in this carefully screened depressed population taken together with multiple positive results for inflammation in previous studies that did not screen out physical illness support a precision medicine approach to the treatment of depression that takes the medical causes for inflammation into account."

This can present as increased stress and anxiety in staff and a reduced patient relationship. If untreated it can lead to sickness and attrition from the profession. This systematic review aims to investigate the evidence of stressors leading to CF in diagnostic radiographers. Method: A review protocol was developed and registered on PROSPERO. Database and grey literature searches were carried out. Studies were selected against pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria for review. No meta-analysis was possible therefore the data were presented as a narrative. Results: Fifteen studies were selected for review published between 1982 and 2020. Evidence demonstrates that diagnostic radiographers suffer from high levels of occupational stress, however, stress is perceived rather than defined. Common causes of occupational stress were identified as poor patient interactions and a lack of time to spend with patients. There is a lack of evidence to show how this stress affects radiographer health or their ability to provide compassionate care. Conclusion: Diagnostic radiographers are prone to suffering from symptoms that can be attributed to CF. This has been present for an extended period, and the main changes have been a decrease in job satisfaction and accomplishment. Patient interaction was identified as a cause, but it is unclear if this affects staff ability to be compassionate. Further work is required to find ways to mitigate these effects and prevent continued deterioration. Implications for practice: This review has highlighted that the issue of CF may be getting worse for some radiographers and that work is required to design and implement workable interventions to try and mitigate these issues."

To better define underlying mechanisms and vascular consequences, this study compared healthy male lowlanders (80 m, n = 10) against age/sex-matched highlanders born and bred in La Paz, Bolivia (3600 m) with (CMS+, n = 10) and without (CMS-, n = 10) CMS. Cephalic venous blood was assayed using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and reductive ozone-based chemiluminescence. Nutritional intake was assessed via dietary recall. Systemic vascular function and structure were assessed via flow-mediated dilatation, aortic pulse wave velocity and carotid intima-media thickness using duplex ultrasound and applanation tonometry. Basal systemic OXNOS was permanently elevated in highlanders (P = 0.001 vs. lowlanders) and further exaggerated in CMS+, reflected by increased hydroxyl radical spin adduct formation (P = 0.001 vs. CMS-) subsequent to liberation of free 'catalytic' iron consistent with a Fenton and/or nucleophilic addition mechanism(s). This was accompanied by elevated global protein carbonylation (P = 0.046 vs. CMS-) and corresponding reduction in plasma nitrite (P = 0.001 vs. lowlanders). Dietary intake of vitamins C and E, carotene, magnesium and retinol were lower in highlanders and especially deficient in CMS + due to reduced consumption of fruit and vegetables (P = 0.001 to 0.028 vs. lowlanders/CMS-). Systemic vascular function and structure were also impaired in highlanders (P = 0.001 to 0.040 vs. lowlanders) with more marked dysfunction observed in CMS+ (P = 0.035 to 0.043 vs. CMS-) in direct proportion to systemic OXNOS (r = -0.692 to 0.595, P = 0.001 to 0.045). Collectively, these findings suggest that lifelong exposure to iron-catalysed systemic OXNOS, compounded by a dietary deficiency of antioxidant micronutrients, likely contributes to the systemic vascular complications and increased morbidity/mortality in CMS+.

Sources of data: Key demographic, service architecture (structural features of work) and well-being indicators were identified and reviewed by a stakeholder group. Data searching prioritized NHS whole workforce sources (focusing on hospital and community health services staff), which were rated according to strength of evidence. Findings: Key differences between professions were: (i) demographics: gender (nursing and midwifery female-dominated, doctors and paramedics more balanced); age (professions other than doctors had ageing workforces); ethnicity (greater diversity among doctors and nurses); (ii) service architecture: despite net staffing growth, turnover and retention were problematic in all professions; 41.5% doctors were consultants but smaller proportions held high grade/band roles in other professions; salaries were higher for doctors; (iii) well-being: all reported high job stress, particularly midwives and paramedics; sickness absence rates for nurses, midwives and paramedics were three times those of doctors, and presenteeism nearly double. Growing points: Sociocultural factors known to increase risk of poor mental health may explain some of the differences reported between professions. These factors and differences in service architecture are vital considerations when designing strategies to improve well-being. Areas timely for developing research: Multi-level systems approaches to well-being are required that consider intersectionality and structural differences between professions; together with inter-professional national databases to facilitate monitoring."

Air pressure decreases with increasing altitude and the partial pres¬sure of O2 decreases in parallel with the atmospheric pressure drop and creates hypoxia in the flight crew and in the passen¬gers. In case of acute hypobaric hypoxia, blood is redistributed to the brain and the heart, whereas blood supply to internal organs, such as kidney and skin is reduced. Peripheral cyanosis can be observed on the fingertips and the lips during hypoxia-induced blood redistribution. Tachycardia develops, but the stroke volume does not change. The coronary blood flow increases in parallel with the rise of cardiac output; however, the presence of severe hypoxia leads to myocardial depression. Coronary reflex vasoconstriction is followed by cardiac arrest. Another important pathology caused by low pressure is decompression sickness. In this disease, immediate reduction of the environmental pressure leads to the dissolved nitrogen transforms into gas, and nitrogen bubbles form in the tissue and in the blood. These bubbles interfere the perfusion of the blood and cause ischemia. Symptoms and signs of cardiac decompression sicknesses are dyspnea, tachypnea, chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, cyanosis, retrosternal discomfort, and rarely, shock. Air embolism of coronary vessels manifests as rhythm disturbances, myocardial infarction, and circulatory collapse. The physical forces that occur because of aircraft move¬ment and affect both the pilot and the aircraft, are called acceleration (G) forces. The basic physical effect of G forces is weight increments and motion restriction. During high +Gz, blood pressure decreases in the brain and increases in the lower extremities. Blood forced to move into the lower parts of the body and lower extremities. Thus, brain perfusion cannot be achieved, and loss of consciousness occurs at approximately +4 Gz acceleration levels. Earth also applies an acceleration force to the objects on or around the world. Therefore, gravitational force is also applied to orbiting spacecraft by Earth. The centrifugal force and the gravitational force are in an equilibrium, weightlessness is created inside the orbiting spacecraft, and this is called microgravity. Blood redistributed to the neck and head veins, and astronauts feel nasal fullness, and bulging around the eyes during space missions. As the time spent in the space progresses, a 22% decrease in plasma volume is observed in the cardiovascular system within 1 week owing to increased venous return, and this causes a temporary hemoconcentration. After staying one week in space, cardiac output increases by 22% whereas peripheral resistance decreases by 14%. Rhythm disturbances are also seen during activities performed in space is and thought to be caused by electrolyte imbalance or stress. There is an increasing demand for high altitude and space travel nowadays. These trips cause several physical and physiological effects on both passenger and flight crew. Therefore, it is necessary to take precautionary measures to carry out these activities safely."

This cross-sectional study enrolled healthy participants who experienced the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes and their aftershocks. Participants completed a questionnaire survey on their symptoms and experiences after the earthquakes. The primary outcome was the occurrence of dizziness and the secondary outcome was the presence of autonomic dysfunction and anxiety. Among 4,231 eligible participants, 1,543 experienced post-earthquake dizziness. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age (≥21, P .001), female sex (P .001), floor on which the individual was at the time (≥3, P = .007), tinnitus/ear fullness (P .001), anxiety (P .001), symptoms related to autonomic dysfunction (P = .04), and prior history of motion sickness (P = .002) were significantly associated with the onset of post-earthquake dizziness. Thus suggesting that earthquake-related effects significantly affect inner ear symptoms, autonomic function, and psychological factors. Earthquake-induced disequilibrium may be further influenced by physical stressors, including sensory disruptions induced by earthquake vibrations, changes in living conditions, and autonomic stress. This study increases our understanding of human equilibrium in response to natural disasters."

Particular harmful conditions occur if the subject, instead to cope the stressful events, succumb to them, in this case, a cascade reaction happens that through different signaling causes a specific reaction named ""sickness behaviour."" The aim of this article is to review the complex relations among important molecules belonging to Central nervous system (CNS), immune system (IS), and endocrine system (ES) during the chronic stress response. Methods: After having verified the state of art concerning the function of cortisol, norepinephrine (NE), interleukin (IL)-1β and melatonin, we describe as they work together. Results: We propose a speculative hypothesis concerning the complex interplay of these signaling molecules during chronic stress, highlighting the role of IL-1β as main biomarker of this effects, indeed, during chronic stress its increment transforms this inflammatory signal into a nervous signal (NE), in turn, this uses the ES (melatonin and cortisol) to counterbalance again IL-1β. During cortisol resistance, a vicious loop occurs that increments all mediators, unbalancing IS, ES, and CNS networks. This IL-1β increase would occur above all when the individual succumbs to stressful events, showing the Sickness Behaviour Symptoms. IL-1β might, through melatonin and vice versa, determine sleep disorders too. Conclusion: The molecular links here outlined could explain how stress plays a role in etiopathogenesis of several diseases through this complex interplay."

Social workers play a significant part in the fabric of UK society, but have one of the most stressful occupations in the country. The aim of this project was to work with UK social workers to co-develop, implement, and evaluate a series of smartphone-based mental health initiatives. A Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach, consisting of semi-structured interviews and focus group and steering group discussions, was utilized to design the mental health and well-being interventions. Study efficacy was evaluated via a pre- and post-intervention survey and post-intervention semi-structured interviews. Interventions developed were psycho-educational, improved top-down and bottom-up communication, and provided access to a Vocational Rehabilitation Assistant for those struggling and at risk of sickness absence. Six months following dissemination, surveys demonstrated significant improvements in communication, and mean score improvements in four other working conditions. This project, therefore, demonstrates that co-developed initiatives can be positively impactful, despite post-intervention data collection being impacted by COVID-19. Future studies should build upon these findings and broaden the PAR approach nationally while taking a robust approach to evaluation."

It is a significant societal and public health problem with potential psychological, social, and economic consequences. Furthermore, infertility has been linked to adverse long-term health outcomes. Despite the advanced diagnostic and therapeutic techniques available, approximately 30% of infertile couples do not obtain a live birth after fertility treatment. For these couples, there are no further options to increase their chances of a successful pregnancy and live birth. Objectives: Three overall questions will be studied: (1) What are the risk factors and natural life courses of infertility, early embryonic loss, and adverse pregnancy outcomes? (2) Can we develop new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for fecundity and treatment success? And (3) what are the health characteristics of women and men in infertile couples at the time of fertility treatment and during long-term follow-up? Material and methods: ReproUnion Biobank and Infertility Cohort (RUBIC) is established as an add-on to the routine fertility management at Copenhagen University Hospital Departments in the Capital Region of Denmark and Reproductive Medicine Centre at Skåne University Hospital in Sweden. The aim is to include a total of 5000 couples equally distributed between Denmark and Sweden. The first patients were enrolled in June 2020. All eligible infertile couples are prospectively asked to participate in the project. Participants complete an extensive questionnaire and undergo a physical examination and collection of biospecimens (blood, urine, hair, saliva, rectal swabs, feces, semen, endometrial biopsies, and vaginal swabs). After the cohort is established, the couples will be linked to the Danish and Swedish national registers to obtain information on parental, perinatal, childhood, and adult life histories, including disease and medication history. This will enable us to understand the causes of infertility and identify novel therapeutic options for this important societal problem."

However, dizziness and imbalance are common in the elderly and have substantial impact on the quality of life. Dizziness interferes with the everyday activities of 30% of persons over age 70. As causes can be multiple, including vestibular and non-vestibular components, it is crucial to detect the factors leading to dizziness and imbalance to maintain mobility and avoid secondary complications like falls and anxiety. The more common causes of dizziness and imbalance in old age are sensory deficits, such as bilateral vestibular hypofunction, polyneuropathy, and impaired visual acuity; benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; and central disorders such as cerebellar ataxia and normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Further relevant factors include sedative or antihypertensive medication, loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia), and the fear of falling. Many elderly persons have multiple risk factors at the same time. Treatable components include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo that can be effectively treated with specific physical maneuvers, sedating drugs that can be reduced in many cases, and sarcopenia that can be treated with physical training. If a specific cause for dizziness and imbalance can be identified, treatment is often successful even in advanced age. The common causes can be revealed by systematic clinical examination and selective laboratory testing."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ratio of patients who were satisfied with the drug and continued to use it versus those who were displeased and did not continue their treatment, and the reasons for the discontinuation. Methods: A total of 1495 men aged 20-40 years who suffered from androgenetic hair loss were selected among patients who were referred to two private dermatologists. They were subjected to treatment with 5% topical minoxidil solution. These patients were treated with no difference from the routine office patients. Factors such as the duration of treatment, adverse effects, the patient's satisfaction and the causes of treatment cessation were also closely studied. Results: Almost all the patients gradually avoided continuing the treatment. Only in a few patients was the cessation of medication due to adverse effects. The causes of discontinuation in the majority of patients were the low effect of medication and an aversion to this topical treatment method. Conclusions: The insignificant cosmetic effect of minoxidil solution caused discontinuity of treatment among almost all patients."

Aspirin overdosage causes ototoxic side effects in some patients, such as bilateral mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus. Recent literature describes, that salicylates act as competitive inhibitors of Cl- anions at the anion-binding site of prestin, the motor protein of the outer hair cell. This molecular mechanism correlates well with the clinical audiological mainstays of aspirin-induced hearing loss, dose dependency, cochlear site of hearing loss and reversibility. We report about a young man with an acute moderate aspirin intoxication resulting in asymmetric hearing loss of 50 dB HL and tinnitus for five days. Otoacoustic emissions were absent on the first day of intoxication but could be measured again on the fifth day after the intoxication. As the ototoxic side effects resolve with in two or three days, no specific treatment is necessary for ototoxicity. Medical treatment of acute or chronic aspirin intoxications aims to decrease further drug absorption by gastrointestinal decontamination and to accelerate elimination by alkaline diuresis. Only in severe intoxications hemodialysis may be considered to treat neurologic, pulmonal, renal or cardial complications."

With increased longevity, the problems of living with a chronic disease have become more prominent in this patient population. Disorders such as fat redistribution and metabolic abnormalities can result from antiviral medications and from HIV disease itself. Pruritus is one of the most common symptoms encountered in patients with HIV. The spectrum of skin diseases in such patients encompasses dermatoses of diverse etiologies; a few are peculiar to patients with HIV while others are not. Some of these conditions may cause severe and sometimes intractable pruritus that provokes scratching, picking, disfigurement, sleep loss, and significant psychological stress. Moreover, the expense of ongoing medical treatments can be daunting. Skin rash can sometimes be the initial presentation of HIV infection or serve as a harbinger of disease progression. Causes of pruritus include skin infections, infestations, papulosquamous disorders, photodermatitis, xerosis, drug reactions, and occasionally lymphoproliferative disorders. Drug eruptions are particularly common in patients who are HIV positive, presumably as a result of immune dysregulation, altered drug metabolism, and polypharmacy. Itching can also result from systemic diseases such as chronic renal failure, liver disease, or systemic lymphoma. Workup of pruritus should include a careful examination of the skin, hair, nails, and mucous membranes to establish a primary dermatologic diagnosis. If no dermatologic cause is found, a systemic cause or medication-related etiology should be sought. Idiopathic HIV pruritus is a diagnosis of exclusion and should only be considered when a specific diagnosis cannot be established. The management of HIV-associated pruritus should be directed at the underlying condition. Phototherapy has been found to be useful in the treatment of several HIV-associated dermatoses and idiopathic pruritus as well. Unfortunately, some of the treatments that have been suggested for patients with HIV are anecdotal or based on small uncontrolled studies. The last decade has seen a surge in the utilization of HAART which, to some degree, reconstitutes the immune system and ameliorates some dermatologic diseases. On the other hand, some skin diseases flare temporarily when HAART is started. Unless frank drug allergy is suspected, HAART does not need to be stopped."

Most of the mood stabilizer and antidepressant drugs can lead to this condition. Some antipsychotic and antianxiety agents induce alopecia. Hair loss is also related to hypothyroidism, which can be induced by lithium and other agents. Alopecia might not be reported by some people, but physicians should be aware of this potential problem which may contribute to noncompliance. Lithium causes hair loss in 12-19% of long-term users. Valproic acid and/ or divalproex precipitates alopecia in up to 12% of patients in a dose-dependent relationship. Incidences up to 28% are observed with high valproate concentration exposures. These pharmaceuticals also can change hair color and structure. The occurrence of carbamazepine-induced alopecia is at or below 6%. Hair loss is less common with other mood stabilizers. Tricyclic antidepressants, maprotilene, trazodone, and virtually all the new generation of antidepressants may on rare occasions lead to alopecia. The same applies to haloperidol, olanzepine, risperidone, clonazepam, and buspirone, but not to other neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates, selected antihistamines, and antiparkinsonians.

The observation was supported by focus group discussions and informal interviews. It was found that the causes of DD can be grouped into: dirty water; wrong (cold, hot, sting) food; part of the growth process; physical condition (extreme heat, cold wind and inner abnormality, inner heat, muscle strain), and supernatural. The type of DD can be grouped into: mild without vomiting named ngadi, negenteng-ngentengi, nambah kepacakan, etc which was linked to the growth process; more severe diarrhea, might be with fever (mising-mising, murus, mencret, etc); more severe diarrhea with severe vomiting (muntager, kolera); bloody/mucoid stool (disentri, mising tai angin, mising umbal). The community had also the concept of prolonged diarrhea named as menerus (literally meaning prolonged) Muntaber was more associated with bad water while the prolonged one was more associated with inner abnormality. The danger of diarrhea perceived was susut = shrinkage, lisut = emaciation. Pale and red hair with lisut were recognized as the dangers of prolonged diarrhea.

Often, physi- cians only need to reassure patients that these symptoms will likely resolve within three to five months. Long-acting injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is the only hormonal contraceptive that is consistently associated with weight gain; other hormonal methods are unlikely to increase weight independent of lifestyle choices. Switching com- bined oral contraceptives is not effective in treating headaches, nor is the use of multivitamins or diuretics. There are no significant differences among various combined oral contraceptives in terms of breast tenderness, mood changes, and nausea. Breakthrough bleeding is common in the first months of combined oral contraceptive use. If significant abnormal bleeding persists beyond three months, other methods can be considered, and the patient may need to be evaluated for other causes. Studies of adverse sexual effects in women using hormonal contraceptives are inconsistent, and the pharmacologic basis for these symptoms is unclear. If acne develops or worsens with progestin-only contra- ceptives, the patient should be switched to a combination method if she is medically eligible. There is insufficient evidence of any effect of hormonal contraceptives on breast milk quantity and quality. Patient education should be encouraged to decrease the chance of unanticipated adverse effects.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to collect and present data on the main clinical characteristics of patients who consult medical internists in Spain. Understanding these characteristics can help in implementing action plans to improve these patients' care more effectively and efficiently. Material and methods: Through an analysis of the Osteoporosis in Internal Medicine (OSTEOMED) registry, this study presents the main clinical characteristics of patients with osteoporosis who attended internal medicine consultations in 23 Spanish hospital centres between 2012 and 2017. We analysed the reasons for the consultations, the densitometric values, the presence of comorbidities, the prescribed treatment and other lifestyle-related factors. Results: In total, 2024 patients with osteoporosis were assessed (89.87% women, 10.13% men). The patients' mean age was 64.1±12.1 years (women, 64.7±11.5 years; men, 61.2±14.2 years). There was no significant difference between the sexes in their history of recent falls (9.1% and 6.7%); however, there were significant differences in the daily intake of calcium from milk products (553.8±332.6mg for women vs. 450.2±303.3mg for men; p .001) and in the secondary causes of osteoporosis (13% of men vs. 6.5% of women; p .001). In the sample, there were 404 fractures (20%), with a notable number of confirmed vertebral fractures (17.2%, 35.6% in men vs. 15.2% in women; p .001). A large portion of the patients did not undergo the indicated treatment and presented low levels of physical activity and sun exposure. A significant percentage of the patients presented associated comorbidities, the most common of which were hypertension (32%) and dyslipidaemia (28%). Conclusions: These results define the profile of patients with osteoporosis who attend internal medicine consultations in Spain. The results also show the multisystemic character of this condition, which, along with its high prevalence, determine that the specific internal medicine consultations dedicated to managing the condition are the appropriate place for caring for these patients."

During lactation, the monoamine serotonin regulates the synthesis and release of various mammary gland-derived factors, such as parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), to stimulate bone resorption. Recent evidence suggests that bone mineral lost during prolonged lactation is not fully recovered following weaning, possibly putting women at increased risk of fracture or osteoporosis. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants have also been associated with reduced bone mineral density and increased fracture risk. Therefore, SSRI exposure while breastfeeding may exacerbate lactational bone loss, compromising long-term bone health. Through an examination of serotonin and calcium homeostasis during lactation, lactational bone turnover and post-weaning recovery of bone mineral, and the effect of peripartum depression and SSRI on the mammary gland and bone, this review will discuss the hypothesis that peripartum SSRI exposure causes persistent reductions in bone mineral density through mammary-derived PTHrP signaling with bone."

Its current prevalence is very high and a further increase is expected due to a higher life expectancy and the progressive ageing of the population. In the prevention of osteoporosis, the main goal is to prevent fragility fractures; for this reason, it is necessary to: 1) promote bone formation in youth, to get sufficient bone mass peak, 2) reduce bone loss in adulthood, especially after menopause, 3) maintain bone health throughout life, and 4) prevent falls. There is enough evidence that multifactorial strategies (assessment of risk factors, healthy lifestyle habits, smoking cessation, moderation in alcohol consumption, physical exercise, outdoor activity with prudent exposure to sunlight, and a varied and balanced diet), are effective in the population at risk. Regarding factors for the prevention of osteoporosis, current recommendations are: increased consumption of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and fluoride; provide adequate vitamin D (even with fortified food if necessary); consumption of foods rich in omega-3 acids; reduction of salt and prepared ready meals; sufficient but moderate intake of protein and, in the absence of intolerance, promote the consumption of milk and dairy products, especially yogurt and fermented milk products."

Most affected women will have had no prior bone density reading, and so the extent of bone loss that may have occurred during pregnancy or lactation is uncertain. During pregnancy, intestinal calcium absorption doubles in order to meet the fetal demand for calcium, but if maternal intake of calcium is insufficient to meet the combined needs of the mother and baby, the maternal skeleton will undergo resorption during the third trimester. During lactation, several hormonal changes, independent of maternal calcium intake, program a 5-10 % loss of trabecular mineral content in order to provide calcium to milk. After weaning the baby, the maternal skeleton is normally restored to its prior mineral content and strength. This physiological bone resorption during reproduction does not normally cause fractures; instead, women who do fracture are more likely to have additional secondary causes of bone loss and fragility. Transient osteoporosis of the hip may affect one or both femoral heads during pregnancy but it involves localized edema and not skeletal resorption. Case reports have described the use of calcitonin, bisphosphonates, strontium ranelate, teriparatide, vertebroplasty, and kyphoplasty to treat post-partum vertebral fractures. However, the need for such treatments is uncertain given that a progressive increase in bone mass subsequently occurs in most women who present with a fracture during pregnancy or lactation."

A ribonuclease-enriched lactoferrin supplement studied here, demonstrates significant reduction in resorption and increase in formation, towards restoring the balance of bone turnover within 6 months. Introduction: Osteoporosis, a major health issue among postmenopausal women, causes increased bone resorption and reduced bone formation. A reduction in angiogenesis could also contribute to this imbalance. Current treatments such as hormone replacement therapy and bisphosphonates have drawbacks of severe side effects. Milk ribonuclease (RNase) is known to promote angiogenesis and lactoferrin (LF) to stimulate bone formation by osteoblasts. We examine the effect of ribonuclease-enriched lactoferrin supplement on the bone health of postmenopausal women. Methods: A total of 38 healthy, postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 60 years were randomized into placebo or RNAse-enriched-LF (R-ELF) supplement groups. The bone health status was monitored by assessing bone resorption markers, serum N-telopeptides (NTx), and urine deoxypyridinoline (Dpd) crosslinks and serum bone formation markers, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and osteocalcin (OC). Results: R-ELF supplementation demonstrated a decrease in urine Dpd levels by 14% (19% increase for placebo) and serum NTx maintained at 24% of the baseline (41% for placebo), while serum BAP and OC levels showed a 45% and 16% elevation (25% and 5% for placebo). Conclusions: R-ELF supplementation demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in bone resorption and increase in osteoblastic bone formation, to restore the balance of bone turnover within a short period."

Mendelian randomization, in which a functional genetic variant acts as a proxy for an environmental exposure, provides a means of overcoming these problems as the inheritance of genetic variants is independent of-that is randomized with respect to-the inheritance of other traits, according to Mendel's law of independent assortment. Examples drawn from exposures and outcomes as diverse as milk and osteoporosis, alcohol and coronary heart disease, sheep dip and farm workers' compensation neurosis, folate and neural tube defects are used to illustrate the applications of Mendelian randomization approaches in assessing potential environmental causes of disease. As with all genetic epidemiology studies there are problems associated with the need for large sample sizes, the non-replication of findings, and the lack of relevant functional genetic variants. In addition to these problems, Mendelian randomization findings may be confounded by other genetic variants in linkage disequilibrium with the variant under study, or by population stratification. Furthermore, pleiotropy of effect of a genetic variant may result in null associations, as may canalisation of genetic effects. If correctly conducted and carefully interpreted, Mendelian randomization studies can provide useful evidence to support or reject causal hypotheses linking environmental exposures to common diseases."

In the diabetic group, there was 16 (16.64%) patients with normal BMD of the spine, 42 patients (43.68%) with osteopenia (mean T-score = -1.8 SD) and 45 (46.8%) with osteoporosis (mean T-score = -3.3 SD). Conclusion: Osteoporosis is more common among Type 2 postmenopausal females in this ethnic group. Since both groups are postmenopausal, having equal percentage of Vitamin D deficiency, multi-parity, non exposure to sun, lack of exercise and negligible milk intake, one can conclude that the low BMD can be attributed to DM in the absence of other causes of osteoporosis."

Personal opposition to perineal examination has been overcome by the use of vaginal self-sampling. Here, we review the use of this procedure notably in low-income countries and the main infectious causes of miscarriage. Vaginal self-sampling was mainly used for human papillomavirus detection but also to detect microorganisms causing sexually transmitted infections or bacterial vaginosis. 58 studies have been performed in low-resource countries, mainly studies performed to detect human papillomavirus in urban and peri-urban areas and demonstrating excellent acceptability. Several infectious causes of miscarriage could be tested using self-vaginal samples. In the future, such strategies coupled with a rapid-identification point-of-care method could allow the development of screening and treatment programs in rural areas in low-resource countries."
14_h,health_belief,19542009,Does listeria cause miscarriage?,listeria causes miscarriage,1.0,"Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous bacterium that causes significant foodborne disease with high mortality rates in immunocompromised adults. In pregnant women foodborne infection can give rise to infection of the fetus resulting in miscarriage. In addition, the bacterium has recently been demonstrated to cause localized gastrointestinal symptoms, predominantly in immunocompetent individuals. The murine model of systemic L. monocytogenes infection has provided numerous insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis of this organism. However, recent application of transcriptomic and proteomic approaches as well as the development of new model systems has allowed a focus upon factors that influence adaptation to gastrointestinal environments and adhesion to and invasion of the gastrointestinal mucosa. In addition, the availability of a large number of complete L. monocytogenes genome sequences has permitted inter-strain comparisons and the identification of factors that may influence the emergence of 'epidemic' phenotypes. Here we review some of the exciting recent developments in the analysis of the interaction between L. monocytogenes and the host gastrointestinal tract."
14_h,health_belief,12561675,Does listeria cause miscarriage?,listeria causes miscarriage,1.0,"Listeria monocytogenes, an intracellular facultative germ that causes the invasion, sometimes fatal, in susceptible hosts is a food borne pathogen with ubiquitary spread that has generated a public health problem for such risk groups as: pregnant women, foetuses, new borns. 504 women with abortive disease were serologically investigated in 1999 for serotype 1a circulating in Romania. The most affected age group proved to be that in the range of 20-30 yrs: 378 (75%) cases. 107 (21.23%) female patients had the diagnostic titer (&gt; or = 1/320): among these, 38 (7.53%) had miscarriages in the IVth-VIIIth month and 18 (3.57%) gave birth to dead foetuses; during pregnancy, 10 (1.98%) female patients received treatment with Ampicillin and 2 (0.39%) treatment with Erythromycin. In the age group &gt; 31 yrs, the 1/320 titer was noticed in 21 (4.16%) female patients but among these only 4 (0.79%) had a history of miscarriage in the final pregnancy months; they were administered Ampicillin during pregnancy. Although there is no clear-cut evidence, our results point to the conclusion that these female patients were contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes."
14_h,health_belief,9255087,Does listeria cause miscarriage?,listeria causes miscarriage,1.0,"One hundred and thirty-six women from an urban, rural and farming community were recruited to a study of infectious causes of midtrimester miscarriage (n = 85), stillbirth (n = 32), or termination for developmental (n = 17) or chromosomal (n = 2) abnormalities. No woman had evidence of acute infection with toxoplasma, listeria, leptospira or Chlamydia psittaci (ovine enzootic abortion). One woman had midtrimester miscarriage associated with primary cytomegolovirus infection and five women had evidence of parvovirus B19 infection, although fetal infection was not proven. Zoonoses were not identified as a cause of fetal loss or malformation in this at-risk population, but parvovirus B19 was a significant cause of midtrimester fetal loss."
